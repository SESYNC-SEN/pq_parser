MISSISSAUGA, Ontario -- When the restaurant elevator doors opened onto a crowd of people, many holding video cameras, Kevin and Julia Garratt thought they had stumbled into a wedding party.
But this was no celebration. In a flash, the Garratts were snatched by men and shoved into separate cars. They would not see each other for more than two years.
On the night of Aug. 4, 2014, the Garratts, Canadian Christian aid workers who lived in the northeastern Chinese city of Dandong, did not know they were in the hands of China's feared Ministry of State Security. The men drove Ms. Garratt, 55, to an office building and demanded that she sign a document stating that she agreed to be investigated.
""Investigated for what?"" she asked. It was only after a translator said the words ""suspect"" and ""spy"" that she understood. In another room, her husband was hearing the same chilling accusations.
Scared and bewildered, the Garratts signed. ""I seriously thought they would realize they'd made a mistake, they'd say sorry, and we'd go home,"" she said.
The Garratts gave their account of their arrest and detention in an interview on Dec. 12, nearly three months after finally being reunited in Canada.
The Garratts suspect they were unwitting pawns in a gambit by the Chinese government to prevent Canada from extraditing a Chinese spy to the United States. The detention of the couple transfixed Canada and proved deeply damaging to the country's relations with China.
The couple's account provides a rare glimpse into the workings of China's opaque state security system. Their interrogations may also reveal clues about the vast reach of China's global espionage network and the lengths to which the Chinese government will go to protect it. During the couple's monthslong detention, for example, they said, they were frequently threatened with execution or told that they would be sent to a North Korean gulag.
At a time of Ottawa's warming relations with Beijing, the Garratts' experience highlights the risks Canada and other nations face in engaging with China. Though they are now back in Canada, the Garratts say they do not feel entirely safe, describing a series of unnerving incidents suggesting that the Chinese government may be trying to keep tabs on them and their relatives.
""Even now we live under a cloud,"" said Mr. Garratt, 56.
Until their highly publicized detention, the Garratts' only claim to fame was owning Dandong's top-rated destination on TripAdvisor: Peter's Coffee House. They lived in China on and off for 30 years, raising their four children there and moving the family from Vancouver to Dandong, a gritty city on the North Korean border, in 2007. Mr. Garratt said he had wanted to address the suffering of those living across the border by providing aid to orphanages and a school for the disabled in North Korea.
Peter's Coffee House, named for one of their sons, quickly became a hub for expatriates, local Chinese curious about the outside world -- and state security agents suspicious of the Garratts and their customers, who included the occasional American or Canadian diplomat.
Ms. Garratt taught international trade and management at a local university while her husband ran the cafe, organizing weekly ""English Corner"" language exchanges. In their spare time, the couple volunteered around Dandong, often taking Chinese orphans ice skating.
One evening, the Garratts were invited to a restaurant dinner by Chinese acquaintances who told them that they wanted advice about how their daughter could apply to the University of Toronto.
But the dinner, along with its aftermath upon the couple's emergence from the restaurant's elevator, was a trap: The setup had been put in motion by the arrest, six weeks earlier in Vancouver, of Su Bin, a Chinese aviation entrepreneur whom the United States had accused of conspiring with two Chinese soldiers to steal secret United States military data.
Those supporting the Garratts say the couple were simply chess pieces in a larger geopolitical skirmish.
""The Chinese made it clear that the Garratt case was designed to pressure Canada to block Su Bin's extradition to the U.S.,"" said James Zimmerman, an American lawyer in Beijing hired by the family to lobby Canadian and Chinese government officials for their release.
In an emailed statement about the Garratts' detention, Global Affairs Canada, the department that handles Canada's diplomatic relations, declined to comment on the question of an exchange, but said, ""Senior government officials were raising the case at every opportunity.""
The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa denied that the Garratts' detention was linked to Mr. Su. ""We don't think it is related to any other cases,"" an embassy spokesman said in an email.
According to the Garratts' account, after signing the investigation document Mr. Garratt was driven to the couple's apartment, where agents ransacked their possessions, grilled him about the contents of the kitchen cabinets and then carted off schoolbooks and computers in the family's suitcases. After a heated exchange, the men allowed Mr. Garratt to take a pair of Bibles back to the detention center.
His wife was already at the compound, an extralegal detention center on the outskirts of the city, confined to a separate isolation cell that had a couch, a bed and a small window covered in opaque plastic. During the next six months, they said, they never knew the other was there.
But neither was ever alone.
Rotating pairs of guards sat on the couch in each of their cells, staring silently at them and writing down their every move. Harsh lights remained on 24 hours a day. To stay sane, Ms. Garratt said, she prayed, read books provided by the Canadian Consulate and each day drew a cryptic picture of something she was grateful for in the back of her Bible, afraid anything written would be confiscated.
They each faced daily six-hour interrogations by a team of three men. Armed with years of emails, Skype messages and surveillance records, the interrogators accused the Garratts of ""hosting"" foreign diplomats at their coffee shop, taking orders from Canada's intelligence agency and stealing state secrets, the couple said.
The agents showed them photos of United States and Canadian diplomats who had visited their coffee shop. The interrogators claimed Mr. Garratt's photos of street scenes in Dandong and views of North Korea across the Yalu River were espionage, even though tourists on riverboat trips took the same photos every day.
Ms. Garratt was forced to write confessions detailing her every conversation with embassy officials, a difficult task considering she had spoken to many foreign customers and did not know who they were. They also made her list the names, relationships and phone numbers of people in China and Canada she had emailed, going back more than a decade.
""When they pushed really hard, they'd threaten to take my son,"" she said, referring to Peter, who was studying at a university in China at the time.
Security officers used a variety of coercion tactics. ""They threatened execution many times,"" Mr. Garratt said with a shudder. In one exchange, the interrogators described a 2009 meeting in Vancouver between the couple and an agent from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, who had wanted to ensure their volunteer work in North Korea was not violating United Nations sanctions. When Ms. Garratt asked how the interrogators had known about the meeting, one of them said, ""We have people in the U.S., Canada, everywhere.""
Canadian officials declined to discuss the Garratts' treatment, but the couple's account squares with those of many people who have been in Chinese detention.
Their isolation ended as suddenly as it began. In February 2015, Ms. Garratt was released on bail and returned to their apartment. In the meantime, her husband was charged with espionage and transferred to a prison medical ward.
During the 19 months he spent there, a rumor circulated among the guards that he would be released as part of a prisoner exchange.
But in February, Mr. Su waived his challenge to extradition and cut a deal with the United States. Once that happened, ""Beijing was stuck with a weak case of espionage against the Garratts and little bargaining leverage to get much of anything out of Ottawa,"" said Mr. Zimmerman, the American lawyer.
In August, just days before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada arrived in China for a Group of 20 summit meeting, Ms. Garratt was allowed to leave the country. Two weeks later, Mr. Garratt was taken to court, where a judge read out an eight-page guilty verdict in Chinese; the next morning, he was put on a plane bound for Tokyo, but only after agreeing to pay more than $14,000 in fines and signing a document promising not to speak with the news media about his detention. Much of that money, he said, had been dedicated to a North Korean orphanage.
Mr. Trudeau called while Mr. Garratt was en route to Vancouver, where the family tearfully reunited. Just days later, China and Canada agreed to discuss a landmark free trade deal and an extradition treaty. The government has denied that it made any concessions to China for Mr. Garratt's release.
Yet the Garratts do not feel entirely free. In recent months, relatives have encountered strange interference on their phones, computers have gone haywire, and strange cars parked outside their homes drive away when someone approaches.
Most of all, the Garratts feel grief at losing the lives they built over 30 years. ""That's the sadness that overwhelms us,"" Mr. Garratt said. ""We were just trying to help people in need. That's all we did.""

'Dixie Mission' Americans Scorned for Backing Mao Are Hailed in China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1854839872?accountid=14586,"Â  YAN'AN, China -- In 1944, a group of American diplomats in a beat-up C-47 propeller plane swooped down onto a rocky runway in Yan'an. Their mission was to assess Mao Zedong, who had made the city in northern China his guerrilla redoubt, and judge whether he deserved American backing.
Some of the Americans concluded that because Mao had the support of the people, he would have the upper hand in the inevitable civil war with Chiang Kai-shek, viewed by Washington as obstinate and corrupt. They were in favor of the United States throwing its weight behind Mao.
For that judgment, they saw their careers destroyed during the McCarthy era. They became victims of the witch hunt for so-called Communist sympathizers and those who ""lost"" China.
But to this day in Yan'an, they are heralded as the good Americans who understood China, and are even featured in a museum and compound here that eulogizes the Communist Party's embattled origins and endurance.
One of the Americans, John Paton Davies Jr., jotted down his impressions of the city:
""Yenan -- which we called Dixie since it was rebel territory -- was from the air a thoroughly insignificant Northwest China town set in a treeless valley. The eroded, lumpish plateau that rose from the valley floor on either side was, in late October, parched bare and tan.""
Some of the others in the Dixie mission were also State Department China experts, like John Stewart Service and John Carter Vincent. Some were United States Army officers, like the mission's leader, Col. David D. Barrett, a Chinese-speaking former military attachÃ©.
In some respects, the old Communist Party stronghold has barely changed. The caves that the cadres used as hide-outs from Japanese bombers still exist, buried into the bleak hills like black eyes. The Yellow River remains a scrawny thread of water. The sense of isolation from the modern metropolises on the faraway coast persists. The food, stingy during wartime, remains surprisingly plain.
Yan'an is now a city of two million people, much of the progress coming on the back of oil and gas, and patriotic tourism designed to attract Chinese citizens curious about the Communist Party's history. Senior cadres, dressed in black suits and chauffeured around in small vans, come to refresh their knowledge of the party's early years under Mao, who fought both the Japanese and the Nationalist forces.
The museum, the Yan'an Revolution Memorial Hall, is a hulking edifice built 10 years ago that commemorates the Communist Party's perseverance in the face of scarce food and diseases, like dysentery, that killed because of the lack of penicillin. The displays say nothing about the brutal ideological purges conducted by Mao and his secret police chief, Kang Sheng.
In one startling image of Service, who was born in China to American missionaries, he is dressed in work clothes, bending over to help a Chinese worker level rocks on the airport runway. Another shows Davies, dressed in a dark shirt and pants, standing in an official tableau with Mao, Zhou Enlai and other party officials.
The Americans called their living quarters the ""dude ranch,"" and Davies, also the son of American missionaries, describes in the memoir ""China Hand"" its eight rooms as dirt-floored, each with two beds fitted with straw mattresses. Heat came from charcoal braziers, and light from kerosene lamps.
The ""ranch"" has been rebuilt (brick flooring added) with wooden pillars in front, and with windows that in a touch of authenticity have glass only halfway up the wooden frames.
A few hundred yards away, a similar building marks the place where the border region military command was housed. A plaque notes that the command's political commissar at the time was Xi Zhongxun, the father of the president of China, Xi Jinping.
The Americans had regular meetings, talking tactics and post-World War II prospects, with Zhu De, the Communist commander in chief, who would later lead the forces to victory over Chiang's Nationalists.
""The Dixie Mission had closer relations with senior Chinese military officers than any Americans have had with the Chinese Communists command before or since,"" Richard Bernstein wrote in ""China 1945,"" his book about the period.
The Chinese were fascinated with the Americans' luxuries: The soldiers each had several uniforms, they enjoyed canned food, and whenever they needed drugs, a plane would arrive with the supplies.
The Americans showed Hollywood movies in their cafeteria. The Chinese soldiers would peer in, shocked by the images of men and women kissing. ""Vulgar taste,"" Li Yaoyu, a Chinese veteran, later wrote of the movies. ""We would leave, allowing these confusing Americans to watch on their own.""
Despite the outward bonhomie, an underlying thread of distrust gnawed at the relationship. When the civil war began in the fall of 1945, the Communists built a wall between the ""dude ranch"" and Xi's building to protect secrets.
The Communists coveted the far more sophisticated American weapons. Li wrote how he and his colleagues had connived to steal an American rifle so they could copy it.
""We drove two American soldiers to a valley in an American jeep to find a Christmas tree,"" he wrote. On the way back, the Chinese announced that the tree had to be delivered in the jeep immediately and that the Americans would have to walk back. Once the jeep returned to headquarters, the Chinese disassembled the rifle, and measured it, all in an effort to figure out how to make it.
Things fell apart when Mao, who had never been out of China, asked for a meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House.
""Mao wrote a letter asking the Dixie mission to deliver it to F.D.R., saying Mao and Zhou Enlai were willing to go to Washington,"" said Zhao Hong, an associate professor of history at Yan'an University. ""The letter was given to Wedemeyer, the commander of American forces in China, but it was not delivered to the president. The contact failed, and the Communists lost faith,"" she said. (Ms. Zhao was referring to Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer.)
The museum ignores the ruined careers of the Americans who portrayed Mao in a positive light. Davies was fired in 1954 during a brief personal audience with the secretary of state, John Foster Dulles. Service was dismissed in 1952, though a Supreme Court decision reinstated him in 1957. Vincent was forced to leave the State Department in 1952.
Mr. Bernstein, in his book, called Davies and Service ""smart and dedicated public servants"" who were ""naÃ¯vely dazzled"" by the Communists.
Ms. Zhao, who has devoted her academic career to the Dixie mission, is not particularly critical of the American decision to stand by Chiang.
""The Americans were practical. They were looking after their own self-interest,"" she said. ""They wanted a pro-American government, and Chiang Kai-shek was easier to manipulate than the Communists.""
As for the men who supported the Communists but suffered for it, she said: ""Service wrote that F.D.R. and Harry Hopkins didn't understand China. But Service really understood China. After a long talk with Mao, he wrote that China would not be a replica of the United States, or a replica of the Soviet Union.""
He was right, she said.

"Chinese Defy Pollution, a Stubborn Visitor","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1856274868?accountid=14586,"Â  Correction Appended
BEIJING -- Like ghosts floating in a dim netherworld, the dancers twirled, spun and curtsied in smog so dense that couples a few steps away seemed to be murky apparitions suspended in a gray haze. Filthy air has swamped much of northern China for weeks, but some amateur dancers have stuck to their outdoor ballroom routines.
The specterlike dancers in Fuyang, a city in Anhui Province, this week have become one of the images that capture China's latest winter of smog. A wintertime surge in pollution here is often called an ""airpocalypse"" in foreign news reports. But as these images suggest, living in this miasma has become for many residents a routine to be endured, even defied with an outdoor fox trot.
""The scariest thing isn't the smog, it's how we've become numbed and used to it,"" said one comment about the pictures on a Chinese news website, 163.com. Others shrugged off the bleakness with sardonic humor, as people here often do.
""There's nothing scary,"" said another comment on the same website. ""Breathing fresh smog every day, I feel fortunate to be living in this magical country.""
Air pollution is chronic across much of industrialized China, but it worsens in winter, when coal-burning heaters fire up and add to the airborne grunge from factories and power plants. An uptick in heavy industry in 2016 has added to the haze this winter, some experts say. In the cold months, polluted air can accumulate across the region, sloshing from one part to another until strong gusts blow it away -- until another pool accumulates. Smog extended from the port city of Tianjin deep into central China on Thursday.
On Tuesday in Fuyang, the air quality there was poor, but not terrible by the hard-bitten standards of many Chinese cities. The level of PM2.5 pollution, the fine particulates that pose the greatest danger to health, reached an average 283 micrograms per cubic meter, and the air was classified ""severely polluted.""
But since December, levels across many cities in northern China have gone much higher, even reaching 1,000 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter last month in Shijiazhuang, a city in Hebei Province. The World Health Organization recommends daily exposure of no more than 25 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter.
Many residents have become increasingly sensitive to the health threats from air pollution. Patience with the smog is wearing thin, especially among middle-class residents, who can afford to travel and experience life and breathing outside the dome of haze.
The government has promised to clean up the air, and indeed there have been improvements, especially throughout the summer last year. Yet that progress has made the return of the smog this winter even more jarring. Travelers returning by air to Beijing lately have descended from blue skies onto a Stygian underworld. For those trying to leave, many flights have been delayed or cancelled on the worst days because of the poor visibility.
What worries many people most is the risk to children and the elderly. This week, a letter in the name of Beijing parents urged the city government to allow schools and parents to buy fresh air equipment for classrooms. Officials said air filters would be installed in some schools as a tryout, though not the bigger equipment the letter called for.
""We really don't want to wait any longer!"" said the letter, which circulated widely on the internet. ""The smog won't wait for us.""
Many people in Beijing and other affected Chinese cities now routinely wear masks -- a novelty even a few years ago -- although often they use cheap, flimsy cotton covers that do little to ward off PM2.5 particles.
""This winter was the first time I've thought about moving away,"" said Lu Xin, a manager with an internet firm, breathing through a high-tech mask attached to its own electric air filter. ""My 3-year-old boy and my parents cooped up at home every day, never going out. Is that a way to live?""

China to Plant 'Green Necklace' of Trees Around Beijing to Fight Smog,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1880496930?accountid=14586,"Â  Correction Appended
Senior Chinese officials have tried tackling their country's chronic air-pollution problem in piecemeal ways -- fining some polluting companies, investing in alternative energy sources and ordering lower-level officials to enforce standards, for example.
To the dismay of many, pollution levels remain among the worst in the world, even if some official statistics point to slight improvements.
Now, officials in Hebei Province, which surrounds Beijing, have decided to create what they call a ""green necklace"" of trees in hopes of clearing the air. Hebei is filled with coal-powered steel factories and has the most polluted cities in China. The pollution from the factories is responsible for much of the smog in Beijing, a city of more than 22 million, and other parts of northern China.
The ""green necklace"" plan was announced Thursday on the Hebei provincial government website. The announcement referred to details that appeared in a March 15 document about coordinating development in Hebei and Beijing.
The plan aims to increase forest coverage on the Hebei-Beijing border, in part by tapping into rivers, reservoirs, wetlands and farmland, an official statement said. Though the plan calls for greater wetlands preservation, it does not mention that Beijing suffers from a chronic drought, so there is very little water on which to draw.
The plan also emphasizes the need for ""ventilation corridors"" that would channel wind and air movement to help disperse smog. In February 2016, Chinese news organizations reported that Beijing officials were considering creating five giant ""ventilation corridors,"" each at least 1,500 feet wide, to run through the city and improve air circulation. The reports said officials were also considering constructing an unspecified number of narrower corridors.
Earlier that month, the website of the government-controlled China Science Daily, officially called Science Times in English, published an opinion article that said the root cause of the smog in Beijing was declining wind strength. And one of the factors behind that was the planting of trees where none had existed before, the article said.
That would seem to contradict the official claims that creating a ""green necklace"" around Beijing would reduce pollution levels.
China has tried ambitious tree-planting projects before to address environmental problems. The most famous have been in the Inner Mongolia region and other parts of northern China, where people have been ordered or encouraged to plant trees to hold back the spread of the Gobi Desert. Scientists have debated the extent to which those measures help, and deserts have continued expanding in critical regions.
Some environmental experts say the real solution to the pollution crisis around Beijing and Hebei is to shut down significant numbers of steel factories in the region. Powerful official interests and state-owned enterprises have opposed such moves.
On Thursday, Anders Hove, an associate director of research in the Beijing office of the Paulson Institute, which does environmental advocacy work, commented on the ""green necklace"" plan on Twitter. ""Cutting Hebei steel emissions would be both cheaper and faster,"" Mr. Hove wrote. ""But widely perceived as too hard.""
Beijing officials have experimented with other approaches on the margins. Last week, Legal Daily, an official publication, reported that police officers in Beijing had detained an employee of a heating company for actions that had led to greater pollution. The man, whose surname was given as Zhao, had overseen the shutdown of desulfurization equipment, the report said.
When an inspection team of police officers and environmental officials visited the plant in western Beijing on March 4, they found that a boiler at the plant emitted more than 10 times the amount of permitted sulfur dioxide, the report said.
Officials fined the company and interrogated Mr. Zhao, who was detained on March 13 after confessing, the report said.
Legal Daily said this was the first time the police had detained a worker under a strengthened environmental protection law that went into effect in January 2015. New regulations listed 23 circumstances under which company employees could be put under administrative detention for causing pollution.
Alex L. Wang, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies Chinese environmental regulations, said although this case was apparently a first for Beijing, regulators in other parts of the country had been using administrative detention. He cited a study that said there had been at least 2,079 cases nationwide since 2015.
""We need to know much more about how these detentions are being implemented,"" Mr. Wang said. ""As potential penalties increase, the opportunity for police abuse increases. Are there procedural protections in place to protect citizens from state overreach?""
""We need to know whether these detentions target the right people,"" he added. ""Are these examples of line-level workers being scapegoated for the decisions of their bosses? And in the end, are authorities using their detention powers in a way that actually improves environmental performance?""

American Airlines Buys China Southern Stake as Traffic Booms,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1881509387?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG -- American Airlines is set to become the second big carrier in the United States to buy its way into capturing more of the big and growing business of flying to China.
China Southern, the biggest airline in China, the world's most populous country, said on Tuesday morning in Hong Kong that it had reached a deal to sell a $200 million minority stake to American as the airlines move forward with a strategic cooperation. The deal ties American, one of the United States' big three carriers, together with one of China's big three state-run airlines.
The agreement, involving the sale of a 2.76 percent stake to American, and the broader cooperation are subject to regulatory approvals, China Southern said in a stock exchange filing in Hong Kong, near the carrier's base in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.
It is the second such agreement between major airlines in the two countries. Delta Air Lines reached a deal in 2015 to pay $450 million for a 3.55 percent stake in China Eastern Airlines, another Chinese carrier with headquarters in Shanghai.
The tiny stake gained by American, based in Fort Worth, reflects the sheer size of the companies and reluctance in both countries to give foreign investors meaningful say in how an airline is run. But the deal could help American capture more traffic between the United States and China through arrangements like code sharing, an industry term for a partnership that allows two airlines to more easily book passengers on each other's flights.
China Southern said Tuesday that details of the business cooperation with American had yet to be finalized but were likely to include code sharing, staff exchanges and collaboration on sales and passenger loyalty programs.
""The share purchase is kind of cosmetic in a way, because the whole thing is about code sharing and putting passengers from China onto the U.S. aircraft,"" said Geoffrey Cheng, the head of transportation and industrial research at Bocom International in Hong Kong.
Today, Chinese airlines account for more than 60 percent of assigned flight routes between China and the United States, said Corrine Png, a longtime transport industry analyst in Singapore. Among American carriers, United is the most established thanks to a partnership with Air China, the third major Chinese airline, based in Beijing. It has a route share of about 20 percent, Ms. Png said, while Delta and American each have a share of about 8 percent.
Much of the growth is from the China side, where traffic from outbound visitors more than doubled between 2010 and 2015, according to official statistics. Chinese airlines are better positioned to tap that market because of to their home-carrier advantage and their deep networks, which reach into the Chinese hinterland from the aviation hubs of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
""The point is there are more Chinese travelers heading to the U.S. than in the U.S. and heading to China,"" Mr. Cheng said.
China is already the fifth-biggest source market for tourism to the United States, and Chinese visitor arrivals are forecast to more than double by 2021, according to an estimate by the United States government. By then, China will become the third-biggest overall overseas market for the United States after Mexico and Canada.
In addition to their lack of networks in the Chinese interior, American carriers have also struggled to add new routes to China's main international hubs because of capacity constraints.
Government-to-government agreements on the number of cross-border routes are reciprocal. But in recent years, traffic at airports in cities like Beijing and Shanghai has been rising fast, and it may take years before new runways or terminals can come online to increase the number of available landing slots at favorable times.
As a result, foreign carriers ""try to work around this, and one way is to invest in a Chinese carrier and hopefully gain market access that way,"" said Ms. Png, the transportation industry analyst.
For China Southern, tapping a bigger foreign market makes sense as a way to catch up with domestic rivals like Air China and China Eastern that draw a larger share of their own revenue from overseas routes. Ms. Png said a deal with American Airlines could take advantage of China Southern's base in Guangzhou, which does not have the same capacity constraints as Beijing.
In announcing the stake sale, China Southern said the deal would ""increase its competitiveness and influence in the global aviation market, and lay a solid foundation for the company to achieve the strategic goal of building a world-class aviation industry group.""

Greater Corruption in China? A Billionaire Says He Has Evidence,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1888640901?accountid=14586,"Â  It happens in Russia -- occasionally. An oligarch, made fabulously wealthy through the privatization of state assets, breaks ranks, becoming a critic of President Vladimir V. Putin.
China was different. Its growing ranks of billionaires often owe their fortunes to the good graces of the Communist Party and its leading families. But the firsthand knowledge that the country's tycoons might have of the complex shareholding ties that serve to enrich the political elite had stayed secret.
That changed this year. In two rambling interviews with a New York-based media company lasting more than four hours, Guo Wengui, a real estate magnate, described what he said was a ferocious struggle that culminated two years ago in the collapse of a business deal pitting him against relatives of a retired top Communist Party official, He Guoqiang.
Since then, Mr. Guo has lived abroad, and is a member of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
In going public with his charges, Mr. Guo demonstrated just how dangerous a loose-lipped billionaire can be to China's Communist Party. The party still strives to cultivate an image of selfless service to the nation, with state-run news media repeatedly emphasizing that no official is immune to President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption drive, now in its fifth year.
If Mr. Guo is to be believed, Mr. Xi, when he assumed leadership of the Communist Party in November 2012, may have faced a far more serious corruption problem than has been publicly disclosed, touching not only the departing chief of the country's security forces but perhaps also the top official in charge of rooting out graft in the party's own ranks, Mr. He. Both were members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the elite body that wields supreme power in China.
""If you are Xi Jinping and you are deciding to go after corruption, can you take them on all at once?"" asked Andrew Wedeman, a professor of political science at Georgia State University who studies corruption in Chinese politics.
The former head of the security forces, Zhou Yongkang, was prosecuted on graft charges and is now serving a life sentence in prison. But there is no report that Mr. He or members of his family have been prosecuted. To Mr. Guo, that demonstrates the weakness of the corruption crackdown: Among the elite, the campaign touches only those who are already on the losing side of factional power struggles.
Mr. Guo explained in a March 8 videotaped interview with Mirror Media Group, a Chinese-language news company based on Long Island, how Mr. He's son He Jintao was the ""boss"" of the second-largest shareholder in Founder Securities, a company in which Mr. Guo was seeking to acquire a large stake. He Jintao concealed his role through a proxy, according to Mr. Guo.
That deal soured when Mr. Guo tried, without success, to name directors to Founder Securities' board and became locked in a dispute with his former business partner, Li You, who was the chief executive of the brokerage's state-owned parent, according to a report by Caixin, a Chinese news company.
Mr. Guo, using turns of phrase that wouldn't be out of place in ""The Godfather"" or ""The Sopranos,"" said He Jintao was working against him.
""To be honest, if I could publish evidence about you, He Jintao, I promise that in 24 hours, 10 million people will take to the streets and will eat you alive,"" Mr. Guo told Mirror Media.
Mr. Guo, who also goes by the name Miles Kwok, did not offer any proof of wrongdoing by the He family. But for all his bluster, there is some documentation to support his assertion that the family had a financial stake in Founder Securities.
In 2015, New York Times reporters working in Beijing, Hong Kong and the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu mapped out the financial network of He Guoqiang's family, examining shareholding records and verifying relationships by interviewing a member of the family. Those documents and interviews show that the family did appear to control, indirectly through a series of shell companies, a stake in Founder Securities, which has a joint venture in China with Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank.
Founder Securities is one of China's biggest brokerages, with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion. Unusual for a securities company, it is based in the south-central province of Hunan, He Guoqiang's native province. Its second-biggest shareholder at the time of its 2011 initial public offering was a company called Lide Technology Development.
Until at least mid-2014, Chinese company records show, Lide was controlled by companies tied to the He family. A member of the family identified one of the ultimate shareholders, Zhang Xiuqin, as He Jintao's maternal aunt. Lide owns stakes in property, medical and financial companies across China worth more than $600 million, corporate records show.
Credit Suisse Founder, the joint venture, was begun in 2008, the first full year that He Guoqiang was on the Politburo Standing Committee, and it allowed the Swiss bank entry, through the venture, to China's domestic investment banking market. Founder Securities retained majority control, with a two-thirds stake.
According to Bloomberg data, the venture underwrote one of its first initial public offerings in August 2010 -- of a company called Hangzhou Shunwang Technology. One of this company's directors was Liao Ying, whose name and biography on the company's prospectus match those of He Jintao's wife.
Moreover, at the time of the I.P.O., Hangzhou Shunwang's third-biggest shareholder, owning almost 10 percent, was a company controlled by the He family and ultimately owned by two of its business associates, according to a review of Chinese corporate records. Credit Suisse Founder was also an adviser for Founder Securities' own I.P.O. in 2011.
A spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in Hong Kong had no comment. Founder Securities and Hangzhou Shunwang did not respond to questions submitted via fax and email. He Jintao did not respond to a request for an interview made through his Beijing-based company, Womei Investment.
With a flourish of bluster and in the third person, Mr. Guo expressed just how heated the conflict was with the younger Mr. He, telling him, via a video interview viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, that more disclosures could come should their business interests clash again.
""Guo Wengui is from the grass roots, born as a farmer and not afraid of death,"" Mr. Guo said. ""If you do it again, then I would have no choice and will fire a cannon to you. I don't want to war against you, but He Jintao, you had better watch carefully what you say and what you do, including with your wealth -- you'll be responsible for it.""

Trump's Turn Toward China Curtails Navy Patrols in Disputed Zones,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1894544746?accountid=14586,"Â  Correction Appended
WASHINGTON -- Six weeks ago, the United States Pacific Command requested permission from senior American officials for a United States warship to sail within 12 nautical miles of Scarborough Shoal, a disputed reef in the South China Sea that is claimed by the Philippines and China.
The Navy had good reason to think the request would be granted. During last year's campaign, Donald J. Trump labeled President Barack Obama as weak in defending international waters in the South China Sea, where Beijing has started a sharp military buildup to reclaim land, install runways and haul equipment onto reefs and shoals it claims as its own. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, during his confirmation hearing in January, called for China to be denied access to the artificial islands. And foreign policy experts and Asia watchers braced for a return to routine Navy patrols within China's self-proclaimed territorial waters, something Mr. Obama allowed sparingly.
But instead, the Pacific Command request -- and two others by the Navy in February -- was turned down by top Pentagon officials before it even made it to President Trump's desk. More than 100 days into the Trump presidency, no American Navy ship has gone within 12 miles of any of the disputed islands in the South China Sea, Defense Department officials said.
The decision not to challenge China's territorial claims represents a remarkable deference toward Beijing from an administration that is increasingly turning toward President Xi Jinping for help amid the escalating crisis in the Korean Peninsula. It remained unclear on Tuesday whether it was Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; or one of their deputies who turned down the three requests. Defense officials said the White House was not involved.
Robert Daly, the director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center, said of the Navy excursions, officially known as freedom of navigation operations, or Fonops: ""All of the language, combined with the fact that the Republican foreign policy establishment had been critical of Obama for not carrying out enough Fonops, means there was a wide expectation that Trump would put down a marker early. And that hasn't happened.""
The simmering crisis in North Korea seems to have changed the Trump administration's earlier assumptions on how to handle China. Mr. Trump campaigned on being tough on Beijing, promising that he would label China a currency manipulator and would go after Beijing on trade.
But with North Korea escalating its provocative behavior the past three months, attempting nine missile launches on six occasions since Mr. Trump came to power, his administration has adopted a more conciliatory air with Beijing as the president seeks help to rein in Pyongyang.
With each missile launch, Mr. Trump's newfound affection for the Chinese leader, Mr. Xi, has increased. Last week, after the most recent launch, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: ""North Korea disrespected the wishes of China and its highly respected president when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!""
Decisions to deny the Navy's requests to sail within 12 nautical miles of disputed islands in the South China Sea were fairly routine during the Obama administration. In fact, Mr. Obama came under sharp criticism from Republicans for suspending such excursions for more than two years, out of concern that they would further raise tensions with Beijing.
In October 2015, the Obama administration sent a guided missile destroyer, the Lassen, within territorial waters near Subi Reef, one of several artificial islands that China has built in the disputed Spratly Islands chain. At the time, Mr. Obama's White House played down the episode and directed Defense Department officials not to talk about it publicly, wanting to avoid escalating a conflict.
Such hesitancy prompted harsh words from Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. In an interview with The New York Times in March 2016, Mr. Trump said that Beijing had built in the South China Sea ""a military fortress, the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen.""
""Amazing, actually,"" he said. ""They do that at will because they have no respect for our president and they have no respect for our country.""
Mr. Tillerson came to office saying that China's island-building campaign was ""akin to Russia's taking of Crimea."" He said that the Trump administration was ""going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops"" and, ""second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.""
That denial of access is now on the back burner. In fact, said Mr. Daly, of the Wilson Center, China has continued to militarize the islands and has bomb-proofed airplane hangars that were built on the reclaimed islands, as well as brought in additional equipment.
Chinese officials have maintained that such action does not constitute militarizing the islands. They say the islands are Chinese territory and Beijing therefore cannot militarize land it already owns. The United States and other countries disagree.
The Chinese have not yet begun construction on Scarborough Shoal. American officials have long viewed doing so as something of a red line, and have cautioned Chinese counterparts that any building on the shoal would be viewed as provocative.
Mr. Obama warned Mr. Xi at a March 2016 meeting in Washington not to start building an island at Scarborough Shoal. Late last year, an unusually large number of Chinese vessels were positioned close to the disputed reef, renewing American concerns.
A Defense Department official described the Pacific Command request last month to conduct a naval excursion within 12 nautical miles of Scarborough Shoal as a signal to the Chinese that building on the atoll remained a red line for the United States. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations more frankly, added that Navy officials believed the request to be in line with what the Trump administration wanted.
But Defense Department officials also said that Mr. Mattis and the Pentagon leadership wanted to look carefully at the strategic implications of such excursions on overall national security policy. While Mr. Mattis is far from opposed to the freedom of navigation trips, he is reviewing the American security posture around the world, Defense Department officials said.
Additionally, Washington's hope that China will rein in North Korea has called into question the timing of the next freedom of navigation sail.
Andrew L. Oros, the author of the newly published ""Japan's Security Renaissance,"" said it was far more important now to address North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons development than to pick a fight over the Navy navigation trips.
""That's clearly the case,"" Mr. Oros said. But, he said, the Trump administration still must closely monitor China's activities and not give ground in the disputed islands.
""And I hope this doesn't give the Chinese the impression that this is a tacit acknowledgment of Beijing's outrageous claims of sovereignty over international waters,"" he said.

Chinaâs Reform Hopefuls Watch for Names. Only One May Matter.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1953234100?accountid=14586,"GUANGZHOU, China â A decade ago, this city in southeastern China had a reputation as one of the countryâs grimmest, with smoggy skies, chronic traffic jams and streams so foul that they had to be paved over to contain the stench.
Today, Guangzhou represents one possible vision of Chinaâs future. While it still grapples with pollution and a wide wealth gap, the city has cleaned up many of its earlier problems, enjoys a modern, 192-station subway system and has a glittering cultural district, including an acclaimed opera hall. The cleaned-up bed of what was once one of its vilest streams is now lined with coffee shops and souvenir stores.
âThe water quality here is far better than before,â said Zhang Kun, a nearby noodle vendor. âBefore, reeking water would pour out of storm drains whenever there was a heavy rain.â
The cityâs progress cheers some advocates of reform as China prepares for its biggest leadership shake-up in five years. Among the candidates who may join the Communist Partyâs top body next week is Wang Yang, an official credited with fostering greener, more sustainable economic growth in Guangzhou and elsewhere in southeastern China when he was the top party official in Guangdong Province.
But it is far less clear that Mr. Wangâs voice would be heard over the voice of the partyâs supreme leader, Xi Jinping, who has amassed power unseen in China since Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.
If named to the Politburo Standing Committee, Mr. Wang would âbe one of the seven,â said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University. âBut Xi Jinping calls the shots, and he will be in charge.â
By official figures, Chinaâs economy is doing just fine. On Thursday, Chinaâs National Bureau of Statistics announced that the economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter from a year ago.
Economists widely believe those figures mask deeper problems. Chinaâs economy, the worldâs second largest, is burdened by debt from a borrowing-fueled binge of building rail lines, highways, bridges and apartment towers. It still relies heavily on dirty industries of the past, like steel and coal.
Mr. Xi has talked about economic reform, but debt ballooned under his watch. His policy measures have tended to focus on helping state-owned enterprises while retaining and even tightening Communist Party control of the entire economy, including private companies.
On Wednesday, speaking at the opening of the Communist Partyâs twice-per-decade congress, Mr. Xi said the party would âsupport state capital in becoming stronger, doing better and growing bigger.â
Willy Lam, a specialist on the Beijing leadership at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: âItâs difficult to imagine Xi Jinping moving toward a reformist position, because Xi Jinping is a pre-modern person. He is basically a man of the 1950s.â
Mr. Xiâs dominance has complicated the reading of tea leaves surrounding the selection of the Communist Partyâs new leaders. On economic matters, he has assumed much of the responsibility traditionally held by Chinaâs premier, who is currently Li Keqiang.
Still, when the partyâs congress closes next week, world economic leaders may glean some clues about Chinaâs direction depending on who is named to the Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-person group that makes its top decisions.
Should Mr. Wang be named to the committee, that could suggest a slightly greater emphasis over the next five years on economic reform, such as giving private enterprise more freedom or curbing dependence on state-directed lending.
But the party could send a different signal if it appoints Chen Minâer, the party boss of the less developed province of Guizhou. Mr. Chenâs development strategy there relied on building lots of tall bridges, a giant telescope and other government-led projects, as well as using official influence to help persuade large companies like Apple and Oracle to locate extensive data centers there.
One other possible new member, experts say, is Hu Chunhua, who succeeded Mr. Wang as Guangdongâs party boss. Mr. Hu has a much more cautious reputation on economic changes than does Mr. Wang, though he allowed many of Mr. Wangâs policies to continue. Outside of economics, Mr. Hu has taken a much tougher approach to dissent, crushing an experiment in democracy in a Guangdong village called Wukan that Mr. Wang had tolerated.
The last party congress, five years ago, offered a hint of Chinaâs debt-fueled approach under Mr. Xi.
Joining him then on the standing committee was Zhang Gaoli, who ran the large metropolis of Tianjin. Mr. Zhang was best known for leading a government effort to build a âNew Manhattanâ â a forest of immense office towers and apartment buildings far from downtown Tianjin, erected in the hope of creating a new financial center. The vast satellite city has begun attracting some residents in recent years but has yet to turn into a financial hub.
By contrast, Mr. Wang was the mayor of an obscure town in south-central China, Tongling, when he wrote a pro-reform essay in 1991 for a local newspaper. The essay â with lines like âHistory will never allow us to slumber onâ â set off a lengthy discussion in Chinese newspapers, giving him a national reputation at the age of 36.
Mr. Wang moved up quickly after that, and by 2007 had become the Communist Party secretary running Guangdong Province. Even before he arrived, the province was one of Chinaâs richest and most entrepreneurial, and more recently it has benefited from a boom in high-end technology manufacturing and the countryâs thriving internet scene.
Still, experts say Mr. Wang helped improve Guangdong. Mr. Wangâs administration imposed stringent environmental rules that forced old and dirty industries to give way to new development. Mr. Wang oversaw the construction of the opera hall and other cultural attractions.
Air pollution in the province peaked in his first year there and has been falling steeply ever since, according to satellite imagery analyzed at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
In Guangzhou, the 14 million-resident hub of Guangdong, one of southern Chinaâs biggest steel mills once loomed over the Pearl River. Now a dozen 42-story apartment buildings stand there. A few old furnaces are set to be part of a historical park.
Across the river lies a stream misleadingly named Lychee Bay.
It once reeked with the effluent from nearby homes and from a nearby bronze foundry. A concrete covering failed to contain the smell.
During Mr. Wangâs tenure, the bronze foundry moved away and Guangzhou expanded its sewage processing capacity. The area became so clean that it now attracts tourists.
âGuangzhou is moving faster in dealing with air and water pollution,â said Peng Peng, the vice president of the Guangdong System Reform Research Society, a public policy group. âGuangzhou relies more on consumption, which seems relatively healthy, and pays attention to the quality of economic development.â
After 2012, as Mr. Xi pushed his government-centered economic strategies, Mr. Wang was named a vice premier and largely disappeared inside Beijingâs bureaucracy. There he was given responsibility for mitigating damage from earthquakes and floods and replanting forests.
Should Mr. Wang, now 62, finally join the partyâs standing committee and take a more senior position in government, he would have more influence but still would be carrying out an agenda drafted by Mr. Xi.
âPerhaps with Wang Yang,â said Mr. Lam, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, âthey might be able to do a little more within the orders from Xi Jinping.â

"In Chinaâs Coal Capital, Xi Jinpingâs Dream Remains Elusive","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1953696571?accountid=14586,"DATONG, China â At first glance, the coal city of Datong in northern China displays the hopeful signs of change that President Xi Jinping had in mind when he promised his nation a new âChina dream.â
Rows of shiny solar panels have mushroomed on farmland ruined by mining. Some 74,000 villagers are being moved into newly built apartments. A drive to clean up government has brought the arrest of several city officials who grew rich on kickbacks.
In an agenda-setting report at a Communist Party congress in Beijing this past week, Mr. Xi, who also leads the party, held out a new dream of a China that would become cleaner, more prosperous and fairer in sharing the benefits of its increasing wealth. This vision of a brighter future is aimed at fixing social ills created by three decades of often-breakneck growth: polluted skies and waters, deep-rooted corruption and growing inequalities.
To succeed, Mr. Xiâs China dream must take root in rural and rust-belt backwaters like Datong, where many of Chinaâs almost 1.4 billion people still live. But to hear locals in this former capital of Chinaâs coal industry tell it, the bustling scenes of construction mask a stark disconnect between Mr. Xiâs bright promises and their hardscrabble reality.
While Chinaâs overall economy has clocked dazzling growth rates, workers and farmers here say their lives have not improved nearly as quickly, if at all. Despite Mr. Xiâs promises of a cleaner and more responsive government, they complain that local officials still ignore them, or run roughshod over their lives.
Most important, they said, Mr. Xiâs China dream had yet to deliver what they needed most: better jobs, improved health care and affordable housing.
In interviews here, the same refrain was often repeated: âXi Jinping is good, but. ...â
âXi Jinping is a good president, but his policies arenât implemented here,â said Hu Wenxiang, who lives in Ronghuazao, a village in a rural part of Datong.
Most of her village has been razed as part of a program to relocate residents away from fields where subsiding coal mines have left the earth sagging and unstable. But Ms. Hu refuses to leave. She said moving to one of the new apartments in an urban part of Datong would deprive her of her income, which comes from helping her son breed goats.
Her rejection of the local governmentâs one-size-fits-all approach to rural redevelopment has left her to fend for herself in a dying village. The people who benefited most from the forced relocation seemed to be the officials who ordered it, and construction companies who built the new units, she said.
âThe governmentâs policies sound good, but we donât see the benefits,â said Ms. Hu, a thin, sun-hardened woman in her 60s. âWhy does the government hand out money here and there, but not to us?â
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of industrial towns and cities like Datong across China, where living standards remain far from the âmoderate prosperityâ that Mr. Xi has promised.
Experts say the grass-roots grievances in provincial China do not pose an imminent threat to Mr. Xi and the Communist Party. But they warn that there is risk as Mr. Xi raises expectations.
He must now deliver on a new social contract that is offering a more equitable and better managed China in exchange for continued public acceptance of party rule.
âThe sources of party legitimacy are no longer as tightly tied to the pace of economic growth, and Xi sees that,â said Wu Qiang, a political scientist in Beijing. âHe wants to offer society a deal. The party wonât tolerate opposition or civil society or calls for democracy and freedom; it will offer more balanced development. But even thatâs a daunting transformation for this government.â
Mr. Xi began proclaiming his dream since taking power five years ago, though he focused much of his early efforts on battling corruption. In Shanxi, the province that includes Datong, investigators have arrested so many corrupt cadres that the national government has declared the region to be in a state of âimplosive corruption.â
However, even in his first term, Mr. Xi recognized that he must offer more than just the crackdown. In 2013, he laid out a list of 60 reform commitments that he said would make China greener, safer, fairer and more prosperous. His government is credited with delivering some progress, such as toughening pollution controls and shutting down excess mines and factories that had fed a glut in production.
In the run-up to the congress, such accomplishments were celebrated in television shows, speeches, editorials and exhibitions. And as Mr. Xi begins his second term, experts say the public still seems willing to give him a chance to deliver on more of his promises.
But that could change if Mr. Xi proves unable to deliver results. And experts say Mr. Xi faces an uphill battle.
Closing outdated factories and mines may bolster economic efficiency, but at the cost of eliminating jobs, which brings the risk of unrest. The slower growth rates of Chinaâs maturing economy have made it harder for the government to increase spending on health and education.
âSo far, the central government has been really good about making promises and commitments but then passing the buck onto local governments,â said Bruce J. Dickson, a professor at George Washington University whose book, âThe Dictatorâs Dilemma,â examines how the Chinese Communist Party stays in power.
âAt some point, you canât simply go after corrupt people. You have to do something,â Professor Dickson said. âAnd the question is what.â
In his opening speech on Wednesday to the congress, Mr. Xi warned that the party had to improve its performance at addressing social grievances.
âThe principal contradiction facing society in the new era is that between unbalanced and inadequate development and the peopleâs ever-growing need for a better life,â Mr. Xi told delegates in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
But in Datong, a broad area of 3.4 million people that includes an urban center and surrounding coal fields and countryside, locals say that the official fixes often create their own new problems. They said the directives from the capital were enacted in a heavy-handed manner that could hurt locals. And even with the anticorruption crackdown, local officials benefit the most from the changes, not regular people.
âI donât have a home anymore,â said a woman in Xiaoyaotou, a village near an abandoned coal mine in Datong. She would not give her name, fearing that speaking out would get her in trouble. She made a little money scavenging and selling bricks from her demolished village, where she said her home had been torn down in April.
âThere are still houses left in my village,â she said. âThey are for the government officials to stay in. We are not allowed to stay in those houses.â
In Datong, the sense of dislocation is especially acute.
Famed for its ancient Buddhist rock carvings, the city became Chinaâs coal capital as demand for the energy resources that lay beneath its surface took off along with Chinese manufacturing in the 1980s. A decade later, at peak production, Datong provided 7.5 percent of Chinaâs coal. The result was an extended boom that created a wealthy class of mine barons and officials.
That ended when demand for coal slumped three years ago, leaving mines and miners idle. As production dropped, the city fell on hard times. It also struggled with the environmental burdens left from its reliance on coal, including smog, contaminated soil and entire swaths of farmland that are now sinking as the mines underneath them collapse.
[Video: âThe Big Pictureâ reporting on coal's slow death in China. Watch on YouTube.]
Tong Yanlin, who works in one of Datongâs still-operating mines, said wages had plummeted. He now works only three or four hours a day and earns slightly more than $700 a month, about half of what he earned in the boom years.
Still, he said he preferred earning lower wages if it meant keeping the mine open, and himself employed.
Datongâs government has tried to create new jobs by encouraging solar and wind farms on top of exhausted coal mines. Despite their efforts, the economy grew at just 1 percent last year, officials said, much lower than the national growth rate of 6.7 percent.
The new investments, and a frenzy of urban renewal, have also created new burdens, leaving the local government heavily in debt.
âFor Shanxi, this transition is a profound revolution,â the provinceâs Communist Party secretary, Lou Yangsheng, said at the party congress in Beijing on Thursday.
Locals wonder what Datong has to offer that could replace coal. With an ironic smile, Mr. Tong, the coal miner, said the city still had plenty of one thing: corruption.
Despite Mr. Xiâs efforts, local officials remained as crooked as ever, he said: âThey could still haul away corrupt officials in one railway wagon after another.â

Xi Jinping Unveils Chinaâs New Leaders but No Clear Successor,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1955114964?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â The ceremony in Beijingâs Great Hall of the People on Wednesday was meant to introduce the world to Chinaâs new leaders, members of an elite committee that for decades has tried to govern by consensus and sometimes has been compared to a corporate board of directors.
Instead, the nationally televised event was more a display of the political power that Xi Jinping has amassed in just five years as president. None of the other members of the new Politburo Standing Committee could be considered equals or potential rivals. The six men stood stiffly in dark suits on the stage, each bowing as Mr. Xi introduced them.
After reciting their names, Mr. Xi added almost offhandedly: âMore information about them can be found through media outlets.â
The debut of the new Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in China, capped a weeklong Communist Party congress that became a celebration of Mr. Xiâs one-man style of rule and his promise to lead a resurgent China to a place at the center of the world stage.
âOver the past five years, weâve done a lot. Some work has been finished, some we must continue with,â Mr. Xi said as his new colleagues, all men in their 60s, lined up before cameras. âA new era needs a new look, and even more needs new accomplishments.â
For the first time in a generation, the new Standing Committee did not include a younger leader who would be groomed as heir apparent. The decision to delay anointing a successor broke with the unwritten conventions that have ensured relatively stable leadership changes since the era of Deng Xiaoping, which was beset by schisms and purges.
By setting himself up as the strongest ruler since Deng, Mr. Xi has pushed the worldâs newest superpower into new and potentially dangerous political territory. On Tuesday, its final day, the congress elevated Mr. Xi, 64, to the same exalted status as the nationâs founder, Mao Zedong, by enshrining âXi Jinping Thoughtâ into the partyâs constitution.
âIf Xi goes for broke and breaks precedent by not preparing for an orderly and peaceful succession, he is putting a target on his back and risking a backlash from other ambitious politicians,â said Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.
âBy taking such a risk, he shows himself to be more like Mao than we originally thought â he demonstrates his power by overturning institutions,â she added.
Mr. Xiâs authoritarian approach was meant to bring faster policymaking after years of stagnation under his predecessor, Hu Jintao. Instead, critics say, the concentration of power in one manâs hands has created its own bottlenecks, with officials unsure how to execute policies or afraid to deviate from top-down demands.
Such problems could worsen. âMr. Xiâs accrual of power heralds a more determined push around his favored economic policy initiatives and efforts to reassert the partyâs role within public life,â said Tom Rafferty, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit. âHowever, aggressive centralization will also bring risks.â
The lack of a potential successor could be seen as a sign that Mr. Xi intends to dominate beyond this next five-year term, which ends in 2023, either by staying in office or behind the scenes. Mr. Xi may also want more time to test possible successors, while avoiding lame duck status with an heir waiting in the wings.
In a possible nod to concerns about Mr. Xi amassing too much power, most of the five new Standing Committee members were not longtime associates of his, though all have worked with him in some capacity. Premier Li Keqiang, the only holdover from the outgoing committee besides Mr. Xi, was once seen as a possible rival to lead the country.
âXi has seemingly chosen magnanimity with the list,â said Christopher K. Johnson, an expert on Chinese elite politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. âOf course, thatâs easy to do when youâve achieved your two core objectives â making yourself the partyâs untenured ideological arbiter and refraining from signaling the succession.â
Mr. Xiâs victory at the congress means he will welcome President Trump to China next month more confident than ever in his hold on power and the partyâs support for his more assertive foreign policy.
His signature initiatives to extend Chinaâs influence overseas, such as the global infrastructure program known as âOne Belt, One Roadâ and a drive to build artificial islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, are now likely to stay unchallenged.
Some China watchers have said they also expect Mr. Xi to place more emphasis on overhauling the economy and cleaning up finances, after spending the past five years stamping out dissent and tightening his control over the party and the military, Chinaâs other political power center.
One sign was the promotion of Liu He, his closest economic adviser and a longtime advocate of curbing debt and financial hazards. As a new member of the Politburo, a broader 25-member council that is less powerful than its Standing Committee, Mr. Liu appears likely to wield greater influence on policy.
In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Xi noted that next year would mark 40 years since Deng opened up China to market forces and vowed to âfirmly and unwaveringly deepen reform in every aspect.â
âHe wants a team around him that will implement his vision,â said Evan S. Medeiros, the senior director for Asian affairs in the National Security Council in the Obama administration. âOn economic issues, one could tentatively say that this Politburo Standing Committee is more reform-minded than the current lineup.â
This weekâs congress, the partyâs 19th since its establishment by Marxist revolutionaries in 1921, has portrayed Mr. Xi as a transformational leader guiding the nation into a ânew eraâ of Chinese socialism. Mao unified China after nearly a century of civil war and foreign invasions, Deng brought it prosperity and Mr. Xi is said to be restoring the nation to global strength and leadership.
The congress blessed Mr. Xiâs agenda by writing his name and ideas into the partyâs constitution, in effect declaring any effort to challenge him to be an act of ideological heresy.
Under Mao and then Deng, the party struggled with succession arrangements that ended in purges and division. Then, in steps from the 1990s onward, the party established a pattern of installing likely successors on the Standing Committee well in advance, with party leaders serving no more than two terms.
Mr. Xi himself joined the committee in 2007, before taking power in 2012. Before him, Mr. Hu served on the committee for a decade before succeeding Jiang Zemin.
The party has promoted a phalanx of officials loyal to Mr. Xi into the broader Politburo. About two-thirds of the 15 new members joining the body once worked under Mr. Xi or have other longstanding ties to him, including some younger leaders seen as potential successors.
They included Chen Minâer, 57, who worked as a propaganda functionary with Mr. Xi when they were both officials in the eastern province of Zhejiang in the early 2000s. Some experts had speculated that Mr. Xi might attempt to catapult Mr. Chen into the current Standing Committee.
Instead, Mr. Chen is one of four Politburo members under the age of 60 who could be considered a candidate to lead the country in five years â but only if Mr. Xi relinquishes control.

Chinaâs Newest Film Festival Tests the Limits of Independence,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1959307769?accountid=14586,"PINGYAO, China â It seemed odd to meet an aspiring director at a film festival who pleaded not to be quoted. He was afraid, he explained, after a discussion about cinema in China veered into censorship and how it affects filmmakers working here.
It is the question hovering over the weeklong festival that opened on Saturday in the ancient walled city of Pingyao: Can you create and showcase independent films in a country that frowns on independence, much less dissent?
âThere is a level,â said Sun Liang, another young director, whose experimental film âKill the Shadowâ played on Tuesday after having its international premiere in Montreal in September. âYou donât want to make something too violent or too inappropriate, to go over that level.â
It is âprobably like this in every country,â he added.
Only it is not. Chinaâs grip on culture is as tight as it is on the media, politics and the economy. And if anything, that grip has grown even tighter under President Xi Jinping, who used last monthâs Communist Party congress in Beijing to anoint himself Chinaâs most powerful leader in a generation.
By accident of timing, the festival seems to have become an early test of what is acceptable in what is now being called the Xi era.
It is the brainchild of the countryâs most celebrated independent filmmaker, Jia Zhangke, whose own work â gritty, violent, politically tinged â has fallen afoul of the censors before.
He said he wanted to present artistic films that might otherwise struggle to reach a wide audience, at home and beyond. Mr. Jia called it the Pingyao Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon International Film Festival in homage to the 2000 martial-arts film by the director Ang Lee.
Mr. Jia would like it to be Chinaâs version of Sundance, Americaâs biggest independent film festival â though perhaps, as officials like to say here, one âwith Chinese characteristics.â
It is impossible, to say the least, to imagine the governorâs office in Utah screening the films to be shown at the Sundance in Park City, though that is exactly what officials in Shanxi Province, where Pingyao is, did for all 52 films shown here.
Mr. Jia said independent filmmaking could still flourish in China, despite such restrictions. âNearly 800 movies are made in China every year, among which there are many by talented young directors,â he said.
Directors and producers in attendance, even those who spoke frankly of the limits, agreed. There is, for now, still space for creativity, they said.
Even so, it was also evident that the festival could not escape the gravitational pull of the countryâs politics. It was originally scheduled to open a week earlier, but when the dates for the party congress were announced, only weeks before it began, the festivalâs schedule had to shift accordingly.
The film chosen for the festivalâs opening, âYouth,â also became entangled in an unspoken rule of congress politics. Its nationwide release in October was abruptly canceled, even though a promotional tour had already begun. Many critics assumed the reason was that it depicted an event â Chinaâs unsuccessful war in Vietnam in 1979 â that would have run against the congressâs message of national strength.
The delay was, naturally, the first question at the festivalâs opening news conference, prompting an evasive answer from its producer, Ye Ning, the chief executive of Huayi Brothers Media. (Despite its premiere here, its national release remains unscheduled.)
The festivalâs artistic director, Marco MÃ¼ller, then chided journalists to steer their questions to the filmâs director, Feng Xiaogang, and two leading actresses. âLetâs emphasize the artistic aspects,â said Mr. MÃ¼ller, an experienced organizer whose role in another inaugural festival, in the former Portuguese colony of Macau, ended with his abrupt resignation last year.
Agang Yargyi, a Tibetan filmmaker who traveled from the western province of Sichuan to attend, expressed admiration for Mr. Fengâs choice of a historical subject, calling it âvery daring.â
Mr. Agang, 27, has made three short films, including one, âDream,â that played in film festivals in Finland and Washington. He described the challenges facing filmmakers, heightened in his case by his ethnic ties to a sometimes restive region. He cannot get a visa, for example, to accompany his films on the festival circuit.
âChina is a country that doesnât like to review its history,â he said.
And yet Chinaâs troubled history is inescapable.
Pingyaoâs historical center, a protected Unesco heritage site, dates back 2,700 years. Its 30-foot walls enclose evocative narrow streets and courtyards hidden behind worn wooden doors. Many structures have been neatly restored, catering to the millions of tourists drawn to one of Chinaâs last unspoiled old cities.
Mr. Jia chose Pingyao because it is near his hometown; one of his films, âPlatform,â takes place there and includes an encounter between two characters on the ramparts of the cityâs walls. That film was about a theater troupe in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, which ravaged the countryâs cultural elite.
The only cinema in Pingyaoâs old city, ironically, was a modern addition, built in 1965, just before the Communist leader Mao Zedong set the Cultural Revolution in motion. The cinema closed in 2003, but reopened last year as a museum. A red banner on the building declares, âLong Live Great Leader Chairman Mao.â
The festival had the financial support of the regional government, which hopes to attract still more visitors.
Opening night drew more than 1,500 people, according to organizers. Fans pressed the barricades framing the red carpets to snap photographs of Chinaâs biggest stars.
These included the actress Fan Bingbing, whose latest film, a patriotic action blockbuster called âSky Hunter,â also played here. It was made in cooperation with the Peopleâs Liberation Army, in keeping with a government-encouraged trend to extol the countryâs might. Its addition certainly bent the definition of independent.
Such, it seems, are the compromises required to put on a festival. Its posters declare âPingyao Year Zero,â signaling Mr. Jiaâs hope that it will be long lived.
Mr. Feng, the director of âYouth,â played down the questions swirling around the festival. Now 59, he saw the Cultural Revolution, and the headlong rush into capitalism that followed, and reminded younger filmmakers that things had once been worse.
âSo many theaters were demolished, turned into saunas, foot baths or nightclubs,â he said. âMaybe every young director has some illusion that his circumstance is the most difficult, that he is the most unfortunate, but really, itâs not that way.â
Then he made what sounded like a plea to persevere.
âThe young directors of today,â he said, âshould not be beaten back by difficulties and setbacks.â

âUncle Trumpâ Finds Fans in China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1962355765?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â They call him âDonald the Strong.â They heap praise on his family. They fawn over his rapid-fire tweets. They have even created an online fan club.
In America, President Trump faces a feisty press corps, damaging investigations into associates and sagging approval ratings.
But in China, where Mr. Trump arrived Wednesday, he has acquired a legion of admirers who hail him as a straight-talking politician and business mogul with a knack for deal-making.
âHeâs true to himself,â said Dai Xiang, a resident of the eastern province of Jiangsu who belongs to an online group of more than 23,000 people that exchanges news and commentary about Mr. Trump. âHeâs real, unlike other politicians.â
As in the United States, Mr. Trump can be a polarizing figure in China. He has his share of critics, who mock him as egoistical and erratic, and for fanning the war flames with North Korea. But he also has many ardent supporters, which is perhaps a surprising development for the leader of Chinaâs biggest geopolitical rival.
They refer to him as âUncle Trump,â âGrand Commanderâ and âDonald the Strong.â After Mr. Trumpâs visit to the Forbidden City on Wednesday with President Xi Jinping, one fan wrote on social media, âLong live Emperor Trump!â
Mr. Trumpâs Chinese fans praise his irrepressible style, his skill as an entertainer and his willingness to say what he thinks. Many also like the fact that he seems less inhibited than previous American presidents about recognizing China as a superpower and as an equal on the global stage.
And after years of American presidents lecturing China on issues like political prisoners and democracy, many also say they are relieved to see a leader who seems to care more about making deals than idealism.
They say Mr. Trump has changed the tone of Americaâs conversation with China.
âPeople are sort of tired of listening to that criticism,â said Xu Qinduo, a political commentator for China Radio International in Beijing. âNow we can talk to each other.â
It helps that the government-run news media has encouraged a positive portrayal of Mr. Trump, focusing on his warm relationship with Mr. Xi and his praise for China. Even those who do know about Mr. Trumpâs troubles at home, including the investigation into his campaignâs ties to Russia, say these donât detract from his admirable qualities.
âIâm not interested in the Russian investigation or his North Korea strategy,â said Zhang Changjiang, 43, an instructor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. âHis purpose is clear. He knows how to whet peopleâs appetite, how to make a scene and how to leverage his abilities.â
For many Chinese, Mr. Trump is a familiar type: the celebrity businessman. Successful, outspoken tycoons can win godlike status in Chinaâs get-rich society, and Mr. Trump is no exception. His books, including âTrump Never Give Up,â received glowing reviews on Chinese websites. He is presented as a role model, a billionaire with his own empire of golf courses and gilded hotels.
Some believe his boardroom acumen will help him strike trade deals that will also benefit Chinaâs economy.
âAs a successful businessman, Trump definitely wonât ignore the huge size of Chinaâs consumer base,â said Li Yang, 25, a designer.
Of course, not everyone is a fan. When asked, some Chinese said they worried that Mr. Trump is inflaming tensions with North Korea, a longtime ally. Others are concerned by his past attacks on China on trade and intellectual property rights. Some described him as mercurial, saying that while he seems to be friendly now, that could suddenly change.
âTrump is a person of ambiguity,â said Sun Caihong, 38, a resident of Beijing. âHis policy is not clear. Heâs just trying to muddle along.â
Others were more calculating.
âIf heâs doing good for China, I like him,â said Liu Chunyu, 56, a deliveryman. âIf not, I donât like him.â
Even some of those who disagree with Mr. Trumpâs policies see him as a refreshing iconoclast, willing to discard the tone of moral superiority that some previous American leaders had held toward China, especially on human rights.
Many Chinese âhave a strong revulsion and hostility toward âpolitical correctnessâ in Western society,â Chen Jibing, a political commentator in Shanghai, wrote in a blog post this week. âThey see themselves in Trump.â
The Communist Partyâs tight grip on information in China might be playing into Mr. Trumpâs popularity, experts say. Stanley Rosen, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, said that the Chinese respect unpredictable, confident personalities, which in their own history would include figures like modern Chinaâs founding father, Mao Zedong.
Mr. Trump is showing that he is spontaneous and âbeholden to no one,â Mr. Rosen said.
Mr. Trumpâs celebrity status also adds to his mystique. Before his election, he was already known in China as the star of âThe Apprentice,â which could be viewed online.
Even his physical appearance has drawn attention â although not always in a flattering way. In lighthearted social media posts, his head of flaxen hair is juxtaposed with photos of roosters and pheasants.
Mr. Trumpâs most effective tool in winning over Chinese audiences may be his family. His daughter Ivanka, who started her own fashion brand, is regarded as a role model for young Chinese entrepreneurs. His 6-year-old granddaughter, Arabella, became a nationally known figure this year after a video appeared of her singing in Chinese.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump showed Mr. Xi another video of his granddaughter singing in Chinese, which was shared widely after it was posted online, attracting tens of millions of views in less than 24 hours.
Other Chinese take a more hard-nosed approach, embracing Mr. Trump because of the advantages that they see him offering to China. They regard an American retreat from global affairs as an opening for Beijing to extend its influence. They also say Mr. Trump has helped enhance Chinaâs stature by treating Mr. Xi as an equal partner.
The Global Times, an ardently nationalist state-run tabloid, praised Mr. Trump for showing respect to Mr. Xi, such as when he called last month to congratulate Mr. Xi on winning a second five-year term as Communist Party leader.
âTrump is the first American president to do so,â said the editorial, which appeared on Thursday. This âreflects his respect for Chinaâs system.â

China Has Donald Trump Just Where It Wants Him,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1962784700?accountid=14586,"YANGON, Myanmar â President Trump is incidental to Chinaâs ambitions, a mere blip on a 33-year plan. In a speech last month, President Xi Jinping set out the objectives with great clarity. By 2035 China will be a âglobal leader in innovation,â showing âsolid progressâ toward âprosperity for everyone.â By 2050, China will be a âglobal leader in terms of composite national strengthâ and a âgreat, modern socialist country.â
Xi gave Trump a warm welcome this week, said the Pacific was big enough for both nations and offered business agreements. Trump made nice and suggested that China and the United States could solve âalmost allâ of the worldâs problems, âand probably all of them.â This was the noise. The real story is growing Chinese strength, steady Chinese purpose aimed at midcentury dominance and erratic American outbursts suggestive of a petulant great powerâs retreat.
China is busy. It has the reserves, the surpluses and the growth to shape the world. More important, it has the pride and the confidence to think long term. America First, Trumpâs ugly slogan, reeks of retrenchment. By contrast, Xiâs One Belt, One Road initiative is an enormous infrastructure project designed to use Chinese money and technology to reconnect the old Silk Road and tie nations to China. In scope and value it dwarfs the Marshall Plan, the postwar reconstruction program for Europe that was a farsighted expression of American confidence almost 70 years ago.
Xiâs speech to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China marked his apotheosis. He has joined the pantheon along with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. His thought is now dogma. His China has entered a different phase. Having grown independent and then rich, it is now âbecoming strong.â
To what end will the strength be used? China, Xi said, âoffers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.â A new era has begun âthat sees China moving closer to center stage.â
There could scarcely be a more explicit offer of China as an alternative, single-party, authoritarian model to the liberal democratic system of the United States (of which Trump has been such a feeble advocate). China is now âactively pursuing almost an ideological competition with the United States,â said Yun Sun, a senior associate at the Stimson Center. Xiâs speech was âa declaration of the Chinese saying that we have won this game, we are winning this game.â
They are, for now. The Chinese gambit â in the past, China has been reticent about offering itself as a global paradigm â comes at a moment of American democratic fracture. Itâs a good moment for Beijing to talk of arriving âcenter stage.â Trump does not really have ideas. He has impulses (like his dangerous infatuation with Saudi Arabia).
On his Asian swing, the president spoke of pursuing a âfree and open Indo-Pacific regionâ built around democracies including India, Japan and Australia. This was the right thing to say to counter China. Hundreds of millions of Asians outside China donât want to find themselves obliged to study Xi Jinping Thought. They prefer liberalism to Leninism.
Xi Jinping Thought calls for building the Chinese military into âworld-class forces that obey the partyâs command, can fight and win.â It portrays the leadership of the Communist Party as âthe defining featureâ of Chinese society.
So Trumpâs commitment to Indo-Pacific freedom is significant. Itâs also dubious. Trump likes surpluses, hates deficits. Itâs not clear whether any Trump strategy can get beyond such zero-sum rabble-rousing.
Around Asia, the last thing countries want is to have to choose between China and the United States. From Singapore to Myanmar, they know that America is the only possible balance to China. If China is money and investment, the United States is security and freedom. The Chinese-American relationship is what the regional order depends on.
Those Chinese targets for 2035 and 2050 presuppose one essential thing: regional stability. Thatâs the headline, not Trumpâs machinations. A second Korean War would be a nuclear war. This is the last thing China wants.
The second-to-last thing is the end of the North Korean regime and a united Korean Peninsula at its border, allied to the United States. Chinaâs rise to dominance is predicated on stability until that dominance is achieved. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, must be managed in this context.
Therefore, China will try to squeeze Kim, not to the point of denuclearization (let alone collapse) but to the point where he does not further provoke the United States or Japan. The question is whether Kim is controllable.
The other question is whether Trump is controllable. Xi projects the image of a reliable partner committed to an open, stable trading system. Trump, meanwhile, goes on walkabout with the Saudis.
For now, a conventional Saudi-backed war in Lebanon against Iranian-backed Hezbollah is more likely than nuclear war with Pyongyang. These things happen when an America-First American president canât think beyond next week (or money).

Chinaâs HNA Keeps Striking Foreign Deals as Banks Wince and Investors Flee,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1977345664?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â With some investors in its bonds running for the exits and foreign banks increasingly skeptical about its prospects, HNA Group tried this week to reassure markets that it has access to the money it needs.
At the same time, HNA, a vast but troubled Chinese conglomerate, is continuing the drive that helped cause its difficulties in the first place: completing billions of dollars in foreign deals.
The competing efforts by a company that has symbolized Chinaâs growing wealth and global ambitions are a problem for the countryâs leaders. They want to end wasteful overseas spending by debt-laden Chinese companies, which in the case of HNA and some others have drawn growing regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Europe.
China has yet to let one of its big conglomerates fail, and HNA is unlikely to be an exception. But it is testing how effectively China can curb such behavior, and how the country may deal with some companies that have gone too far.
HNA said late Wednesday that it had talked to eight Chinese banks, including powerful and politically connected lenders like China Development Bank and China Construction Bank, about extending the conglomerateâs credit lines next year. HNA said several of the banks planned to increase the amount of money it could borrow if needed.
Bank officials believe âHNA is the best-quality client of banks,â according to a statement posted on HNAâs website. An HNA spokesman said the company had no further comment.
HNA made the disclosure as its problems continued to mount.
The companyâs publicly traded bonds have fallen in recent days as worries grew among global investors about the challenges it faces. The bondsâ declining value makes it more expensive for HNA to borrow, which analysts say the company must do to meet its obligations. It owes at least $21 billion to bondholders overseas and $16 billion in so-called syndicated loans from banks, according to data from the data provider Dealogic.
âThe situation is a lot worse now,â said Chung Yuh Ang, a senior fixed-income analyst at iFast Corporation, an online investment platform. âHNA is only able to pay its old debts by taking new ones.â
Foreign banks have already grown wary of working with HNA. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have stopped doing business with the company, while HSBC bankers have shared concerns among themselves about HNAâs acquisition binge and its ownership structure, according to internal documents and people with direct knowledge of the firms.
Despite the banksâ hesitation and growing skepticism on the part of officials in China, Europe and the United States, HNA is moving ahead on completing deals it has struck this year. It announced $12 billion worth of deals in 2017, $3 billion of which are pending, according to Dealogic. In recent months, HNA units have agreed to pay $300 million for a refrigerator-logistics business owned by Automotive Holdings Group and $1 billion for CWT, a Singaporean logistics operator.
After a buying spree that began two years ago, HNA now has operations in countries from Germany to Australia, and in cities like Hong Kong, London and New York. People around the world take money from a financial institution it partially owns, fly on its planes and sleep in its hotels.
In many instances, HNA has paid dearly for its acquisitions.
âHNA has bought things at clearly high prices,â said Gordon Orr, the former Asia chairman at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. âThe auctions they won havenât been by a dollar but by miles.â
Beijing officials warned this summer that HNA and other private Chinese companies spending big money abroad â known locally as âgray rhinocerosesâ â were threatening the countryâs economic stability. Many of HNAâs peers got the message. Dalian Wanda, a once-mighty real estate and entertainment conglomerate, has sold many of its assets to pay off its debt. The chairman of Anbang Insurance, which famously swooped in to buy the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York and tried to strike deals with the family of President Trumpâs son-in-law, was detained.
At a news media event in Beijing on Nov. 28, HNAâs chief executive, Adam Tan, discussed the possibility that the company would sell some assets, like those related to real estate, which do not fall under the most strategically important investments recently outlined by President Xi Jinping.
âWe will not invest in anything the government does not support,â Mr. Tan said at the event, which was hosted by Caijing Magazine.
HNA is nonetheless pressing to complete its pending deals, even as regulators from Washington to Brussels to Switzerland grow increasingly skeptical.
A lawsuit filed last week in a New York state court by Ness Technologies, a company that HNA tried to acquire, accused the Chinese company of dooming the deal by not trying hard enough to address questions from officials at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a group that scrutinizes foreign purchases of domestic companies. HNAâs ownership structure attracted a number of questions from committee officials, the suit says, but the companyâs answers undermined its credibility.
In a statement, HNA said it âbelieves this lawsuit is baseless and without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it.â
Another HNA deal, to acquire an investment firm called SkyBridge Capital, has missed self-imposed deadlines amid scrutiny from American takeover officials. The deal drew attention because HNA would be buying SkyBridge from Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House adviser who did not take a position as a Trump administration liaison to the business community amid close examination of the deal.
[Video: SkyBridge addressed its delayed deal to be purchased by HNA. Watch on YouTube.]
Guang Yang, the chief executive of HNA Capital, the subsidiary that has agreed to buy SkyBridge, said the firm was âcommitted to closing the transaction with SkyBridge as soon as possible.â
In Germany, HNAâs proposed acquisition of shares in Deutsche Bank, a major global lender, has drawn questions. The European Central Bank is considering opening an inquiry into whether HNA is a qualified owner of its 10 percent stake in Deutsche Bank, according to a person with knowledge of the procedure who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The central bank has the authority to examine an investor if it appears that the investor could exert significant influence over management.
Germanyâs financial markets watchdog, BaFin, is also examining whether HNA fulfilled its reporting requirements as it increased its stake in the bank, according to someone with direct knowledge of the matter. Deutsche Bank, the European Central Bank and BaFin declined to comment.
A Swiss regulator has gone a step further than its counterparts in Germany and the United States.
Last month, the Swiss Takeover Board cited HNA for providing false information about its complicated share structure when it acquired Gategroup Holding, a Swiss airline catering and logistics company.
The Swiss regulatorâs investigation began after HNA said the stake had been transferred to a charitable trust amid questions about one of its biggest shareholders.
Although the Swiss takeover board has no enforcement powers, it asked Ernst & Young to conduct a further inquiry, which could lead to litigation in the future.
âWe cooperated fully with the Swiss Takeover Boardâs inquiry,â HNA said in a statement, adding that it would ârespect its authority in this matter.â

"A Blue Sky in Beijing? Itâs Not a Fluke, Says Greenpeace","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1999791512?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Winters in Beijing have long been choked by thick, dusty, toxic smog. But this winter, the sky has taken on a once seemingly unthinkable hue: blue.
Now, an analysis of government data by Greenpeace has confirmed what many people could see but that nonetheless seemed too good to be true.
Pollution in Beijing and in 27 other cities in northeastern China has fallen precipitously, dropping 33 percent on average compared with the last three months of 2016.
In Beijing, pollution fell 53 percent. Greenpeace estimated that lower pollution levels resulted in 160,000 fewer premature deaths across China in 2017.
The drop indicated that the governmentâs antipollution campaign â first announced in 2013 but accelerated last year for regions around the capital â has begun to show results.
Even so, pollution levels fell less precipitously or rose elsewhere, suggesting that a concerted effort last fall to shift heating to natural gas from coal may have simply shifted the harmful effects to regions far from the capital.
In the northern province of Heilongjiang, on the border with Russia, pollution levels rose 10 percent. In a statement with its analysis, Greenpeace argued that the results demonstrated the need for more government action, noting that nationwide the drop in pollutants was only 4 percent.
âChinaâs national air pollution action plan has brought massive reductions in pollution levels and associated health risks, but policies favoring coal and heavy industry are holding back progress,â Huang Wei, one of the organizationâs campaigners, said in the statement.
But in Beijing, where pollution levels are tracked as closely as property prices are in Hong Kong, London or New York, the respite from eye-watering, throat-scratching smog has nonetheless been welcomed. Only a year ago the pollution was so bad on some days that schools were closed and flights were canceled.
Air quality is measured by the concentration of PM2.5, or particulate matter of a size deemed especially harmful; such pollutants contribute to a variety of health conditions. Anything under 50 is considered good.
For a couple of days at the end of December, levels nearly reached 300, which is considered hazardous, but those were, for this winter so far at least, the exceptions. (On Thursday evening, as this article was being written, the level was 29, according to the China Environmental Monitoring Station index.)
But beyond the health risks, pollution also poses a political risk for the government of President Xi Jinping as he moves to promote the countryâs rise on the world stage.
The government does not seem to be resting on its laurels in the fight against pollution. The Ministry of Environmental Protection warned in a statement on Wednesday that clearer skies were caused in part by favorable weather conditions, and that conditions could worsen in late January and early February.
âLocal governments need to strengthen pollution controls to further cut emissions and make sure they reach their goals on air quality improvement,â the ministry was quoted as saying in China Daily.

Why Chinaâs Good Environmental Policies Have Gone Wrong,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1999793045?accountid=14586,"As my plane was landing in Beijing in mid-December, I realized I had forgotten to bring my N95 respirator mask, and instantly regretted it. But that day turned out to be clear, if chilly. A Chinese public-health expert later told me that it was no exception: There were far fewer days of smog in 2017 than just a couple of years ago.
Terrific, I thought â until I came to understand the unintended costs of the dramatic improvement in the capitalâs air quality.
To reduce the levels of hazardous particles known as PM2.5, the Chinese authorities started a major campaign in 2013 to convert coal-generated heating to gas or electric heating. But in the northern province of Hebei, for example, as overzealous local officials put the changes in place, exceeding government targets, demand for the new fuels suddenly surged â creating shortages that left millions without proper heating in freezing temperatures.
This is but one example of the ways in which Chinaâs air-pollution policy may have been a bit too successful. The Chinese government deserves credit for its resolve in tackling the problem. Yet the rapid concentration of power under President Xi Jinping â helped along by the steady purging of officials suspected of corruption â has put apparatchiks and bureaucrats on edge. And their rush to please has unexpectedly distorted how environmental policy is made and implemented, sometimes with unwanted consequences.
In 2013, after decades of single-mindedly pursuing economic growth, often to the detriment of the environment and public health, the Chinese government changed course. That year, as smog blanketed much of the country, it declared all-out war against air pollution.
The government issued an action plan requiring that the PM2.5 concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area be cut by around 25 percent by the end of 2017. Mr. Xi endorsed the effort himself, over the years repeating that, âClear waters and green mountains are as good as mountains of gold and silver.â
In 2016, the Ministry of Environmental Protection set up the Central Environmental Protection Inspection to monitor the local implementation of environmental laws and policies. After conducting an investigation in eight regions that summer, 1,140 officials were disciplined â named and shamed, asked to apologize, subjected to administrative sanctions or, in some cases, taken to court.
The pressure remains. In early 2017, the Beijing municipal government announced that by yearâs end it would slash its coal consumption by 30 percent more than the goal set in 2013. The following month, the Ministry of Environmental Protection kicked off an inspection campaign said to be its largest to date.
A report delivered by Mr. Xi during the Chinese Communist Partyâs last congress in October contained a full chapter dedicated to âSpeeding up Reform of the System for Developing an Ecological Civilization and Building a Beautiful China.â
These measures appear to be paying off: By the end of last year, according to government sources, China seemed to have met all the major targets in its 2013 action plan.
Yet the rush to set them and then meet them has had perverse effects.
As it hurriedly devised the national action plan in 2013, the government set targets based on incomplete scientific data, including from health professionals.
Back then, for example, scientists were still debating the causes of smog in China. As a result, Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged last year, Chinaâs air-pollution measures have focused on limiting coal burning, car emissions and flying dust. They do not tackle other pollutants, like ammonia released by nitrogen fertilizers used in agriculture, which, some scientists have said, may contribute up to 20 percent of the smog in China.
The targets were also determined without the benefit of adequate research about the effects of pollution on human health. As of a few months ago, senior health officials were still claiming not to have conclusive clinical studies about the connection between smog and cancer. (Cancer is a leading cause of death in China, and lung cancer is its most common form.) Plausible or not, that assertion suggests that measures for controlling air pollution were devised with too little regard for its actual impact on health. Less attention still has been paid to the health effects of pollution on the elderly, a complicated but ever-more important issue as the population ages.
No wonder some of the pollution-control targets can seem arbitrary: Why decide that the level of PM10, another dangerous particle, should be brought down to 10 percent nationwide, rather than 9 percent â or even 11 percent? And sometimes the goals are inadequate: Beijing authorities are priding themselves on bringing the cityâs PM2.5 level below 60 micrograms per cubic meter, yet the World Health Organization recommends a maximum annual mean of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.
And then, in order to quickly meet these sometimes questionable goals, some local officials with an eye on career advancement â or simply fearful of being sacked â have overshot or been heavy-handed with enforcement.
One of the objectives of the clean-air campaign was to regulate and remove businesses deemed to be san luan wu â scattered, messy and dirty. Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, initially identified 539 such companies. But after local leaders learned that they would be sanctioned if inspectors found any additional san luan wu firms, they expanded their lists to included many very small businesses, like auto repair shops or stalls selling steamed buns. Within three months, the number exceeded 10,000, putting at risk mom-and-pop operations that actually pollute very little.
The haste to fulfill pollution-control targets may also reveal a greater interest in satisfying the demands of short-term campaigns than in undertaking long-term structural changes. Unless the shifts are institutionalized, or at least routinized, they may not be sustained.
Centralized, authoritarian power is sometimes credited with allowing quick policy changes that would be difficult to contemplate in democracies, where checks and balances and political jostling can delay reform. But under Mr. Xi, political power has become so centralized and so authoritarian that it has perverted the incentive structure that drives environmental policy and its execution. In such a system, even good policies can have bad effects.

"Where China Built Its Bomb, Dark Memories Haunt the Ruins","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1999792532?accountid=14586,"JINYINTAN, China â Among the yak herds and Tibetan Buddhism prayer flags dotting the windswept highlands of northwestern China stand the ruins of a remote, hidden city that vanished from the maps in 1958.
The decaying clusters of workshops, bunkers and dormitories are remnants of Plant 221, also known as Chinaâs Los Alamos. Here, on a mountain-high grassland called Jinyintan in Qinghai Province, thousands of Tibetan and Mongolian herders were expelled to create a secret town where a nuclear arsenal was built to defend Mao Zedongâs revolution.
âIt was totally secret, you needed an entry pass,â said Pengcuo Zhuoma, 56, a ruddy-faced ethnic Mongolian herder living next to an abandoned nuclear workshop, whose family once supplied meat and milk to the scientists. âYour mouth was clamped shut so you couldnât talk about it.â
That changed in the 1990s, when âAtomic City,â as it is now billed, became a patriotic showpiece, celebrating the scientists and laborers who worked in the harsh, breathtaking conditions on a plateau 11,000 feet above sea level. They built Chinaâs first atomic bomb, detonated in 1964, then its first hydrogen bomb, tested in 1967, and they helped develop missiles to carry the warheads.
Today, veterans of the project proudly speak of how they helped to forge Chinaâs nuclear shield. A museum, still forbidden to foreigners, tells visitors that the weapons were made to fend off American and Soviet aggressors encircling China. A statue of Mao gazes paternally over the square of the main town, where thousands of people still live.
âAt the time, Chinaâs social conditions and international position were a bit like North Korea now,â said Liao Tianli, a writer who visits Jinyintan once or twice a year and has interviewed scientists who worked on the project. âFor many people, it was purely in the spirit of âIâll do whatever Chairman Mao tells me to.â â
Yet even as the scientists have won recognition for their work, lifting some of the secrets of Plant 221, other dark parts of its past remain muffled in official silence and censorship. Building nuclear weapons here came at a grievous cost, and a few survivors and researchers have tried to exhume the layers of history unmentioned in the memorials and displays.
The herders and farmers who were moved for the project endured starvation, executions and brutal expulsions. Political paranoia engulfed the project itself, and thousands of scientists and technicians were persecuted. Some veterans have said that the nuclear workers were not adequately protected against radiation, or given effective care after they fell ill from cancer.
âIf nobody spoke out, then this episode of history would still be buried,â said Wei Shijie, 76, a retired physicist who worked in a detonation and explosives workshop at Plant 221 during the 1960s. He wrote a lightly fictionalized memoir describing the persecution of workers there, and he has called for better medical care for retirees from the project.
âBehind the halo of building the two bombs and launching a satellite, many people made agonizing sacrifices,â Mr. Wei said. âMuch of that sacrifice was unnecessary.â
The beauty of Jinyintan has been celebrated in song, and in a film from 1953. In warm months, the grasslands burst into luxuriant green, and Tibetan and Mongolian herders have for centuries guided yaks and goats over the pastures.
But after 1958, Jinyintan disappeared from Chinese maps. Scientists and their Soviet advisers, who helped China with its embryonic atomic program until the two Communist powersâ bitter split in 1959, chose the site, and thousands of Tibetans and Mongolians who lived here were the first to be sacrificed for the project.
The Plant 221 museum says those herders moved voluntarily, helped by the government and rewarded with thousands of sheep. But the bucolic images are belied by the account of a police officer who investigated what happened.
Herders in many parts of Qinghai had risen up against the confiscations of land and livestock that were part of Maoâs so-called Great Leap Forward. Officials, concerned that the uprising might threaten the nuclear plant, were gripped by fears of spies and saboteurs.
âIt was necessary to resettle for Plant 221, but the methods used in Jinyintan were utterly barbaric,â said Yin Shusheng, who investigated the clearances as a police officer in Qinghai in 1963. Mr. Yin, now 80, said his report was ignored, and he described the brutality he uncovered in a memoir published in 2012, in a Chinese magazine later brought to heel by Communist Party officials.
âI wrote about this to sum up lessons from the past so we donât commit the same mistakes,â Mr. Yin said in an interview.
He wrote that officials imprisoned about 700 herders around Jinyintan, accusing them of joining counterrevolutionary gangs. Seventeen died under brutal interrogation. Up to 9,000 herders were expelled in forced marches, given only a day or so to prepare and allowed to take just a few yaks per family. Hundreds died on the journey, beaten and abused by guards, Mr. Yin wrote.
âPeople were no better than beasts of burden,â a surviving herder told an ethnic Mongolian researcher who published their accounts in a small Chinese magazine in 2007. âWe werenât counted as humans.â
The thousands of scientists, technicians and soldiers who poured into Project 221 knew little about what had preceded them. At its peak, Plant 221 had 18 workshops, labs and buildings scattered across 220 square miles, and up to 30,000 scientists, workers and guards lived there.
But even as the secret city forged ahead to build a hydrogen bomb, it was not immune to the political storms tearing China apart. In 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to purge and purify his movement, and the nuclear site â now politically suspect, having been built with the help of the hated Soviets â erupted in purges, interrogations and fighting between rival radical factions.
Mr. Wei, the retired physicist, said he watched as one of Plant 221âs top scientists, Qian Jin, was clubbed by interrogators. Mr. Qian died a few days later. Officials detained and interrogated about 4,000 workers in the nuclear project, and about 50 were executed, beaten to death or killed themselves under the relentless accusations, according to Mr. Wei.
Those events go unmentioned in the museum, and some former officials from the plant have urged Mr. Wei not to dwell on such tragedies, he said.
But he tells them there is no getting away from the past.
âI emphasize that we should reflect on it,â Mr. Wei said. âI still have dreams of 221.â

âSheâll Die if She Stays With Usâ: A Baby Abandoned in China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn. edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1999791623?accountid=14586,"The 6-month-old girl was found alone at night in a park in southern China, sleeping in a stroller. Next to her, in a lime-green backpack, was a bottle of infant formula, diapers and a two-page note from her parents.
âSheâll die if she stays with us,â it said, according to Chinese news reports. âWe know this is selfish, but we have no way out.â
The police in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan are now trying to find the parents of the girl, who the authorities say abandoned her on Saturday because they could not afford to treat her epilepsy.
The case has prompted a national debate about the high cost of medical treatment and the hardships suffered by children with disabilities. Each year, about 100,000 children are abandoned across China, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission, many of them because they have disabilities.
On social media sites, many people were quick to criticize the parents of the 6-month-old girl.
âWhatever their reasons,â a commenter wrote on the microblogging site Weibo, âI canât forgive them.â
But many people also lamented the lack of resources available to Chinese families raising children with disabilities.
âI have pity for the child, but the family had no choice,â wrote one user. âUnfortunately, the country has no way of rescuing these children, and theyâll only be exploited.â
Children with illnesses are often seen as undesirable and costly in China, driving many families to abort or abandon them. Abandoning a minor is a crime in China punishable by up to five years in prison, and courts have argued that if a child dies after being left in dangerous conditions, it is equivalent to murder.
âParents are often nice people who feel hopeless raising these children themselves and believe they will have a better life with a better family,â said Qiu Lili, founder of Beijing Angel Mom Charity Foundation, which helps care for abandoned children.
A health care system marked by high co-payments and deductibles, as well as inconsistent coverage, means that paying for treatments can be devastating for low-income families. Adding to the problem, many families lack insurance coverage for infants, advocates say.
Ms. Qiu said that while families with disabled children in large cities like Beijing and Shanghai receive generous subsidies, those living in smaller cities often lack the resources to give them long-term care.
âChild welfare has improved recently in China, but itâs still not good enough,â she said.
The parents of the 6-month-old girl said in their letter that they had already depleted their savings, spending 60,000 renminbi, or about $9,400, on treatment.
âThereâs no money to help her recover and she canât take care of herself,â the letter said. âHer life is doomed.â
The letter, addressed to the âkindhearted people who see this,â said that the girl would be better off in a government-run child welfare center. The parents said the girl liked to be cuddled and that her caretakers should give her hugs to calm her down.
The last part of the letter read:
The childâs development is severely behind. If you can, please talk to her and hold her little hands and feet often. This might help with her mental growth.
The child has already started eating rice porridge. She can have a small bowl of it every day. If possible, please feed her a suitable amount.
We are really thankful to you, the kind people who will be blessed your whole life. We will atone for our sins for the rest of our lives.

The Propaganda I See on My Morning Commute,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1992360530?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â People joke that itâs now easier in many Chinese cities to use Communist Party slogans rather than street names to give directions.
Looking for a bank in Downtown Beijing?
Walk past the screen proclaiming, âThe people have faith,â take a right at the poster glorifying President Xi Jinping and cross the footbridge with the banner declaring a new era of prosperity for China.
Even as China grows increasingly confident on the global stage, Mr. Xi is using propaganda at home to protect his strongman rule and extend the partyâs dominance over everyday life.
At the most recent party congress, Mr. Xiâs name and ideas were made part of the Constitution. Now, âXi Jinping Thoughtâ is pervasive, butting up against advertisements for hair transplant surgery, luxury cars and Danish butter cookies.
Mr. Xiâs Beijing bristles with adulation for the party and the president. During my half-hour commute to work at The New York Times bureau here in Beijing, I encounter more than 70 pieces of propaganda.
Billboards emphasize the importance of taking care of parents and being loyal to superiors. Banners urge people to remember the original intention of the Communist Revolution.
Even at home, propaganda is inescapable. I look out a window to see a screen describing China as âunited by one heartâ and President Xi, Chinaâs most influential leader in decades, as the architect of a national renaissance.
Here are some of the hidden messages in Chinaâs street propaganda.
Chasing a Dream
Mr. Xiâs signature slogan is the âChinese Dream,â a vaguely defined promise of prosperity and rejuvenation that ties Chinaâs quest to become a superpower to the hopes and struggles of its people.
This poster shows a path to an idyllic village in the style of a traditional Chinese painting, part of Mr. Xiâs efforts to justify the partyâs rule by presenting it as the heir and steward of 5,000 years of Chinese culture.
The image plays into the idea that a better life is around the corner for Chinaâs nearly 1.4 billion people â âunder your feetâ â so long as they maintain faith in Mr. Xi and his dream, expressed by the large red character.
The poster alludes to the belief that China is close to restoring its rightful place as a leading power in the world after decades of poverty, strife and embarrassment by other countries. A caption reads, âChinese spirit, Chinese image, Chinese culture, Chinese voice.â
One Family
Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, sees strife in areas that are home to large populations of ethnic minorities as one of the biggest threats to the partyâs dominance. That includes the western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, where conflict has broken out between security forces and residents who have protested severe limits on religion and free speech.
The government says it is stamping out separatism, but advocates say Mr. Xi is leading a campaign to undermine minority culture and to promote the dominance of the Han ethnicity and the Communist Party, which is officially atheist.
In public, the party often embraces the idea of ethnic harmony, broadcasting videos on prime-time television of minority groups performing traditional rites, for example.
This image above, which shows people from a variety of ethnic tribes, reiterates the partyâs position that Chinaâs more than 50 ethnicities are âunited by one heart.â It is a warning to any group in a faraway region that may consider challenging Mr. Xiâs policies.
Loyalty at Home
During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and â70s, the party was at the center of everyday life. Mao Zedongâs image hung in homes as a symbol of the hopes of the people, and families studied his speeches and writings assiduously.
Mr. Xi has called for a return to the days when offices, schools and community groups were lively hubs of party worship and families united behind a singular leader. He has presented himself as a transformational figure in ways that recall the personality cult of the Mao era.
In this image above, which shows a woman sewing a Communist flag under the words âheart toward the party,â the government is reviving the idea of sacrifice for the party and suggesting that socialist ideals should inform daily decisions.
A Clean Party
Mr. Xi, who is general secretary of the Communist Party, has led a withering campaign against corruption that has ensnared thousands of officials, as well as many of his political rivals.
This poster highlights his campaign by quoting a Chinese proverb used to describe a person free of corruption: âPure wind in two sleeves.â The idea is that clean officials do not hide anything up their sleeves.
Mr. Xi has said the party can survive only if it eliminates corruption, and he is preparing, as he begins his second five-year term, to expand the campaign to millions more people.
While graft is still rampant in China, Mr. Xiâs efforts to fight corruption have made him popular in many areas. Here, propagandists are reminding the public of the presidentâs commitment to the issue. âKeep the alarm bells ringing,â the poster says.
Common Values
In China, criticizing Mr. Xi can land you in prison. The news media is under the constant watch of censors. Local elections, when they are held, are often a farce.
But the government sees things differently. Officially, the Communist Party embraces a dozen âcore socialist values,â including freedom, rule of law, justice and democracy. These values are memorized by schoolchildren and immortalized in song-and-dance routines.
The values, shown in the image above intertwining the hands of several people, are meant as a rebuttal to those in the West who criticize Chinaâs authoritarian system and human rights abuses. They are a rejection of the idea that only Western leaders can define what it means to be free.

President Xiâs Strongman Rule Raises New Fears of Hostility and Repression,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049850854?accountid=14586,"President Xi Jinpingâs efforts to indefinitely extend his rule as Chinaâs leader, announced on Sunday, raised fresh fears in China of a resurgence of strongman politics â and fears abroad of a new era of hostility and gridlock.
Mr. Xi, who has been president since 2013, has tried to cultivate an image as a benevolent father figure who is working to promote Chinaâs peaceful rise.
But the ruling Communist Partyâs decision to open a path to a third term for Mr. Xi heightened a sense of resentment in China among academics, lawyers, journalists and business executives. Many have watched warily as Mr. Xi has used his power to imprison scores of dissidents, stifle free speech and tighten oversight of the economy, the worldâs second largest.
Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing who is critical of Mr. Xi, said the change to the Constitution would turn Mr. Xi into a âsuper-president.â
âHe will have no limits on his power,â he said.
Government censors rushed to block criticism of the decision. Internet memes depicted Mr. Xi as an emperor with no regard for the rule of law and showed a portrait of Mr. Xi replacing Maoâs hallowed image in Tiananmen Square. Another repurposed an ad for Durex condoms, adding a tag line â âTwice is not enoughâ â to poke fun at the idea of Mr. Xi angling for a third term.
The partyâs move comes as Mr. Xi has proclaimed an era of Chinaâs greatness, when the country, he says, will take what he sees as its rightful place as a top global power. Already, it is establishing military bases in the Western Pacific and Africa, building infrastructure across Asia, parts of Europe and Africa, and running what Mr. Xi hopes will be the worldâs No. 1 economy within two decades or sooner.
âChina feels it is on the road to great power status and they want to perpetuate the trajectory they are on,â said David Finkelstein, director of China Studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va.
Some analysts outside China said they worried that allowing Mr. Xi one-man rule might worsen an increasingly tense relationship between the United States and China.
After years of efforts by the United States to engage China on issues from market reform to climate change to human rights, the Trump administration turned on Beijing last December and called China a strategic competitor in its first national security document.
Washington policy makers are preparing plans to impose tariffs on some Chinese imports, limit Chinese investments in the United States, particularly in technology, and spend more on the United States military to sustain its big advantage over the Peopleâs Liberation Army.
In congressional testimony earlier this month, the director of the F.B.I., Christopher Wray, described China as ânot just a whole of government threat but a whole of society threat.â
Mr. Trump may well see Mr. Xiâs consolidation of power as part of a global trend toward increasingly influential leaders, in which he might include himself along with Mr. Xi and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian leader, said James Mann, the author of âThe China Fantasy,â which contradicted the popular view that increasing prosperity would lead to political liberalization in China.
âIâm guessing he will not deplore the lack of democracy in China, because thatâs the sort of thing he rarely if ever does,â Mr. Mann said of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Mann also said Mr. Trump might not have much problem with what Mr. Xi had accomplished.
âOver the past 14 months in office, Trump has almost never voiced the sort of support for our constitutional system that has been a staple in the statements of past presidents,â Mr. Mann said. âHe does not respect the dignity or integrity of political opponents. He does not express support for the independence of the courts or the freedom of the press.â
So if anything, he said, âI think Trump is probably jealous.â
From Clinton to Bush to Obama, the prevailing belief was engagement with China would make China more like the West.
Instead, as Mr. Mann predicted, China has gone in the opposite direction.
Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said Mr. Xi most likely did not care how the world would interpret his designation as a potential ruler in perpetuity.
With an unlimited term in office, Mr. Xi would almost certainly be in office beyond 2024, the year Mr. Trump would leave the White House if he won a second term.
âThis objectively makes him stronger than Trump, who has no reason to like the change,â Mr. Shi said.
At home, Mr. Xi will probably have considerable support for a third term, the result of a yearslong campaign to sideline political rivals and limit dissent. And nationalists cheered the decision, describing Mr. Xi as a singular force who could restore the glory of the nation.
But as the news spread, readings of Hannah Arendt, who wrote about the evils of totalitarian rule, and passages from George Washington, who retired after two terms as president, were discussed on social media in Chinese legal circles.
Douglas H. Paal, a China expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the sudden move, before Mr. Xi even starts his second term next month, suggested that things were not ânormalâ within the Communist Party.
âThis looks like forced marching, not normal order, so something is going on,â Mr. Paal said. âXi is winning, but it will take sleuthing to find out what. These are not ordinary times.â
A series of visits by senior Chinese officials to Washington in the past month to try and persuade the Trump administration to slow down plans to introduce punitive measures that could result in a trade war had failed, Mr. Paal said.
âThis could get complicated when controversial U.S. initiatives meet unconventional times in China,â he said.
Still, Mr. Xi is popular in many areas â his fans affectionately call him âUncle Xiâ â and his brand of folksy nationalism wins accolades, especially in rural areas. Experts said Mr. Xi would probably benefit from the perception in China that the rest of the world is chaotic.
âWith a population amazed at the incompetent mess in much of the rest of the world, and intoxicated by nationalism, for Xi to effect this change will be seen as reasonable,â said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at Kingâs College, London.
But Mr. Xiâs assumption of unfettered power may not work out the way he thinks, said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and a former senior Australian defense official.
âThe risks to his personal fortunes are huge,â he said. âWhat if the Peopleâs Liberation Army decides he should be cut loose?â And, he added, âWhat if growth slows more than expected?â
If Mr. Xi comes under pressure at home or abroad, he could become unpredictable, and even dangerous, Mr. Jennings said. The reach for more personal power could be the start of his downfall.
âThe West can take no comfort in that because Xiâs situation means he may take more risks in the South China Sea or over Taiwan,â he said. âHe has nothing to lose and everything to gain by engaging in more Putin-like brinkmanship.â
Moreover, he added, âWhere does one ever see the âpresident for lifeâ model end well?â

Xi Jinping Dreams of World Power for Himself and China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049861733?accountid=14586,"President Xi Jinping of China has played his boldest political card yet, maneuvering to extend his rule indefinitely so that he can maintain control of the countryâs complex system long enough to achieve the dream of great-power status, asserting economic and political influence across the globe.
Since China began to open to the West in the late 1970s, the United States and its allies have tried to integrate it into the political and economic system they built after World War II, hoping that economic progress would lead eventually to political liberalization.
Mr. Xiâs move proves that policy has failed and that China will set its own path, challenging the liberal order based on the rule of law, human rights, open debate, free-market economics and a preference for elected leaders who leave office peacefully after a fixed period. Despite increasing concerns about Chinaâs evolution, the West has yet to come to grips with this threat.
Since taking office in 2013, Mr. Xi has amassed power assiduously, taking control of not just the government but also of the Chinese Communist Party, the military and the press. He has imposed his views on the educational system and culture, hardening an already authoritarian system that ruthlessly controls social media and wields law enforcement to crush dissent. The obsession with control hints at a deeply insecure state, not a global power.
Nevertheless, he has persuaded the party to effectively make him emperor for life by announcing plans to amend the Constitution to abolish term limits, which would have ended his presidency in 2023.
The changes seem to ensure that Mr. Xi will continue pursuing his agenda, which has begun to lift millions of people out of poverty, reformed state-owned enterprises, protected the environment and built strategic industries. If all goes according to plan, he could preside over the transition when China eclipses the United States as the worldâs largest economy in absolute terms within two decades.
Diverging from the free-market path, Mr. Xi has involved his government more deeply in economic affairs, reining in Chinaâs private companies and insisting on more market access abroad for Chinese businesses while limiting opportunities for foreign companies in China. Thatâs a major reason the Trump administration formally declared China a strategic competitor and is preparing to impose tariffs on some Chinese imports and to limit Chinese technology investments in the United States. The two sides will have a chance to discuss the matter when Chinaâs top economic strategist, Liu He, visits Washington this week.
In a break from his predecessors, Mr. Xi is also pushing a more aggressive foreign policy that includes establishing military bases in the Western Pacific and Africa, modernizing the military and starting a $1 trillion program to develop roads, bridges and power networks across Asia, Europe and Africa. He has worked to dilute international norms on human rights and interfered to an alarming extent in Australiaâs political and economic life.
Mr. Xi has also been touting China as an alternative model to politically strained democracies like the United States, and such ideas, fueled by Beijingâs checkbook diplomacy, have found resonance in places like Rwanda, Cambodia and Thailand.
But doubling down on the strongman model is risky. By moving from an autocratic collective to one-man rule, Mr. Xi has upset the political norms that were put in place to erase the personality cult of Mao and make political transitions more predictable.
The system Mr. Xi has created also makes it less likely he will receive sound policy advice or be challenged on decisions in ways that could avoid mistakes. Thatâs because he solidified his power base during the first term by waging an aggressive campaign against corruption and dissent, silencing political rivals and stacking the ruling Politburo with loyalists reluctant to speak up.
But not all are happy. Despite the risk, a well-known political commentator and a prominent businesswoman have penned open letters urging lawmakers to reject a plan that would allow Mr. Xiâs power grab.
One has to wonder what such control will do to innovation, a driver of progress in successful economies. Or whether knowing he has a job for life, Mr. Xi â who has presented himself as a benign father figure overseeing Chinaâs peaceful rise â may be tempted by other risks, including in foreign policy.
By consolidating unfettered power, Mr. Xi now owns it all. If he fails, there is no one to blame but himself. And there are many daunting problems facing China, including an aging population, a need to maintain high growth rates, and heavily indebted state-owned and private businesses.
Whether Mr. Xi succeeds or fails at this experiment in dictatorship matters not just to China but the rest of the world as well. He is increasingly dominating the international space as President Trump cedes Americaâs traditional leadership role, including its defense of democratic norms.
The American counterbalance must be more creative and comprehensive than just starting a trade war, as Mr. Trump is inclined to do. In this regard, the White Houseâs response to Mr. Xiâs power grab was not encouraging. âThatâs a decision that would be up to China,â the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Monday.

Chinaâs Censors Ban Winnie the Pooh and the Letter âNâ After Xiâs Power Grab,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049861568?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Liu Jin, a 27-year-old teacher in central China, is the kind of young nationalist that President Xi Jinping can typically count on. Mr. Liu shares propaganda photos of the president in battle fatigues online and reverently calls him âUncle Xi.â
But Mr. Liu was dismayed this week when he heard that the ruling Communist Party was changing the Chinese Constitution, allowing Mr. Xi to stay in power indefinitely.
âI disagree,â Mr. Liu wrote on Weibo, a microblogging site, listing examples of power-hungry emperors and autocrats. Censors immediately deleted the post.
During his more than five years in power, Mr. Xi has cultivated an image as a man of the people â a centered, sympathetic leader who lines up with workers to buy pork buns while also guiding the worldâs most populous nation to growth and global influence.
But the move to abolish term limits, announced on Sunday, has resurrected deeper fears in Chinese society, where memories remain of the personality cult of Chinaâs founding father, Mao Zedong, and the fevered emotions and chaos that it conjured.
Anxious to suppress criticism, and maintain an appearance of mass support, the Communist Partyâs censors have scoured the internet and social media for content deemed subversive. The sanitizing has included many images of Winnie the Pooh â Mr. Xi is sometimes likened to the cartoon bear â and search terms like âmy emperor,â âlifelongâ and âshameless.â
For a short time, even the English letter âNâ was censored, according to Victor Mair, a University of Pennsylvania professor, apparently to pre-empt social scientists from expressing dissent mathematically: N > 2, with âNâ being the number of Mr. Xiâs terms in office.
In their coverage, Chinaâs state-run news outlets have played down the move, as if in hopes that most Chinese simply will not notice, or care. When reports mention the change, they argue that term limits should be eliminated to ensure leadership continuity at a time when China has ambitions to challenge American dominance and reclaim its rightful place on the global stage. âChina cannot stop and take a break,â the nationalistic Global Times warned. âThe country must seize the day, seize the hour.â
Despite the blanket of censorship, and the fear that many expressed in stating their actual opinions in public, some cracks have appeared in the facade of public unity behind Chinaâs strongman.
Retirees who endured the trauma of Maoâs Cultural Revolution are warning of a return to dictatorship. University students are posting quotes from George Washingtonâs farewell address online. Business executives, concerned about the Communist Partyâs growing grip on private enterprises, are hastening plans to relocate overseas.
Li Datong, a former journalist and critic of the government, has circulated an open letter calling on the Communist Party to block Mr. Xiâs plan or risk âonce again planting seeds of chaos in China and causing untold damage.â He said that Mr. Xiâs power grab would overturn the very stable and predictable system for peaceful transitions of power set up decades ago after the chaos of Mao and succession struggles under Deng Xiaoping.
âItâs going to break the chains placed on the system,â Mr. Li said in an interview. âItâs going to be very dangerous.â
While some have likened Mr. Xi to Mao, others reached further into Chinese history, comparing Mr. Xi to Yuan Shikai, an early 20th-century warlord who briefly restored Chinaâs monarchy with himself as emperor.
For all the discontent, analysts said it was unlikely anything would block Mr. Xiâs attempts to extend his rule.
For one, much of the frustration over the term-limits plan is limited to the urban elite. Mr. Xi remains immensely popular among farmers and blue-collar workers, as well as a new generation of young nationalists, who admire what they view as his steely drive and see him as the architect of Chinaâs ascent in the 21st century.
âItâs not a bad thing to remove term limits, so long as the leader has strong abilities,â said one such supporter, Mou Yuxiu, 19, a college freshman in the southwestern province of Sichuan. âPresident Xi is such a person.â
For another, Mr. Xi already has an iron grip on Chinese society. A sweeping anticorruption campaign has ensnared tens of thousands of officials and imposed discipline on the Communist Party and other powerful institutions like the Peopleâs Liberation Army, Chinaâs military. There have also been conspicuously public arrests of lawyers and dissidents, including Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong-based publisher who has been in custody for more than two years, apparently for publishing books critical of Mr. Xi and China.
While the plan to abolish term limits may be one of the most important political decisions in decades, many citizens are simply unaware of it. The decision has been buried inside newspapers and mentioned only in passing on television news shows.
âI didnât pay much attention to the change,â said Peng Man, a worker from the countryside now living in Beijing. âItâs a good thing if they are good officials. Itâs bad thing, if they are not good officials.â
But for others, Mr. Xiâs maneuvering has rekindled memories of the Cultural Revolution, the decade-long upheaval instigated by Mao that fractured Chinese society and left more than one million dead.
Many see echoes of Maoâs obsession with power in Mr. Xi, who has placed the ideal of absolute loyalty to the party at the center of everyday life. Like Mao, Mr. Xi has also filled Chinaâs society with political slogans and used propaganda to present himself as the leader needed to guide China to its destiny.
Critics argue that by putting such a personal stamp on power and eliminating the previous collective leadership model, Mr. Xi is setting the stage for a return to the excesses of personal loyalty and fanaticism that nearly tore China apart during Maoâs time.
âMany people inside and outside the system went through the Mao era and their anxiety is intensified,â said Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing, whose father, a government official, was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution.
Others harbor nostalgia for the politics of the Cultural Revolution, which they see as a time of decisiveness and ideological purity. They dismiss criticism of Mr. Xiâs strongman tendencies, saying centralized power is a sign of prosperity and stability.
âXi Jinping can explore a new mass democracy in his own way, without the chaos, disorder and blood, and without the darkness and negatives,â said Zhang Hongliang, a Maoist commentator. âCentralized power is just a tool. What matters is who holds it.â
Mr. Xi has presented himself as a singular figure who has what it takes to eliminate corruption, reduce income inequality and extend Chinaâs influence in the world.
While gauging public opinion in an authoritarian country is difficult, surveys suggest Mr. Xi has an approval rating of more than 80 percent. In interviews, many praise him for maintaining robust economic growth at a time when more advanced nations have faltered and for challenging Americaâs dominance in areas like the South China Sea.
But even many of Mr. Xiâs admirers have been taken aback by his bid for indefinite rule. Some worry that he might upset the peaceful transitions of power that have brought stability.
âMore mistakes can be made if the term is longer,â said Shi Jin, 45, a stay-at-home mother in Beijing.
Others are now looking to leave China, and immigration agencies are seizing the moment to advertise their services.
Wu Dan, a graphic designer, said she had received four calls from immigration agents this week. She said she had decided against it, even though she disagreed with the plan to abolish term limits.
âAs a patriotic young person, I hope our country can have fewer people who are starving, our government can think for the people and our media can speak for the people,â Ms. Wu said. âI still hope our government will make the right decision by reflecting on history.â

Hard-Charging Chinese Energy Tycoon Falls From Xi Governmentâs Graces,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2047961032?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â A mysterious Chinese buyer surprised the financial world last year when it swooped in to buy a $9 billion chunk of Russiaâs state oil company. Few outside China had ever heard of the firm, called CEFC China Energy, or could explain how it would complete â or even pay for â such an expensive and politically sensitive deal.
The companyâs young chairman, Ye Jianming, cast himself as a new kind of private entrepreneur in China. He had somehow become a big player in a strategic sector long dominated by big state companies. He appeared to have the governmentâs blessing and a relationship with a group tied to Chinaâs military, according to experts.
His company invested so much in the Czech Republic that the Czech president named him an economic adviser.
But Mr. Ye now appears to have come under pressure from the government of President Xi Jinping, joining other major corporate figures in China.
Caixin, the Chinese business magazine, reported this month that Mr. Ye was being investigated for unspecified reasons. A person briefed on the companyâs situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that several senior executives had been barred from leaving the country.
CEFC declined to comment for this article. Earlier, it issued a statement condemning the Caixin report as âirresponsibleâ and saying it was not based on fact.
Beijing is trying to rein in the unruly side of its corporate giants â plucky, privately run companies that burst onto the global scene just a few years ago, scooping up billions of dollarsâ worth of hotels, properties, companies and even high-profile soccer teams. They financed their acquisitions by borrowing large sums, posing a challenge for Chinaâs pledge to tackle rapidly growing debt in its financial system.
Mr. Xi has sent a strong message to Chinaâs billionaires and entrepreneurs that such unrestrained deal making will no longer be tolerated. In February, the government seized Anbang Insurance, the owner of the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan and the buyer of billions of dollarsâ worth of other properties around the world. Wu Xiaohui, Anbangâs chairman, who had been detained in July, was charged with economic crimes.
Like Anbang, CEFC appears to have taken on significant debt. Two Chinese ratings firms, China Chengxin and United Credit Ratings, have downgraded their outlook on the companyâs finances, citing mounting debt. United Credit also cited the report of the investigation of Mr. Ye.
This week, an employee in the Hong Kong office of CEFCâs nonprofit arm said that the office was closing and that other employees had resigned.
But much of CEFCâs rise, and the reasons behind its latest stumbles, remain murky. âI had never heard this company being talked about before the Rosneft deal,â said Xizhou Zhou, head of power, gas, coal and renewables at IHS Markit, an information provider. Rosneft is Russiaâs state oil company.
âIt wasnât on peopleâs radar at all,â he said.
CEFC also faces a legal challenge in the United States.
American officials arrested a top executive of its nonprofit arm in November and charged him with offering bribes to officials in Uganda and Chad in exchange for oil rights. While court documents do not mention CEFC, the details of the case show prosecutors have evidence that Mr. Ye and other executives were apprised of the executiveâs activities.
In a rare interview in 2016 with Fortune, which ranked him on its list of top business executives under 40 years old, Mr. Ye said he had gotten his start buying oil assets that once belonged to Lai Changxing, a Chinese businessman who fled to Canada to avoid charges of running a smuggling ring. To get the funding, Mr. Ye said, he sold investors on a business that would find opportunities where Chinaâs state oil companies could not compete. He was in his mid-20s at the time.
In the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, CEFC scooped up European oil assets and built up a network of oil storage facilities and transport services through Central Asia and Europe.
Eventually, CEFC was able to secure highly coveted licenses to import oil as the government began to open up the oil sector. In Hainan Province, CEFCâs oil storage facilities are used as part of the countryâs strategic reserves.
By 2015, it had posted nearly $40 billion in revenue.
While not state run, CEFC showed it knew how to navigate politics. Mr. Ye, for example, has said in his official biography that he was once deputy secretary of an organization called the China Association for International Friendly Contact. That group is part of Chinaâs Peopleâs Liberation Army, according to researchers for the United States Congress and Mark Stokes, a former United States military attachÃ© in China and the executive director of a defense research group, the Project 2049 Institute.
It also has direct ties to the ruling Communist Party, through an internal party committee and the Communist Youth League, a training ground for many officials, according to its website.
Mr. Ye also cultivated the image of someone with political connections. A framed calligraphy of Mr. Xiâs hung on the wall in Mr. Yeâs Shanghai office, according to the Fortune article. On his desk sat a red phone made to look like the famous âred machinesâ that the Communist Partyâs most important members would use to tap into a secure line of communication.
The company also played to Chinaâs geopolitical ambitions with investments spanning Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. Its deals have promoted Chinaâs âOne Belt, One Roadâ initiative, Mr. Xiâs push to spread Chinaâs influence abroad.
Overseas, Mr. Ye and other CEFC executives have worn diplomatic hats. In the Czech Republic, where CEFC bought a majority stake in a bank, a brewery, a publishing house and one of the two national soccer teams, Mr. Ye is an economic adviser to President Milos Zeman. Weeks after CEFC said it would acquire the Rosneft stake, the president of CEFC, Chan Chauto, met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow.
In Hong Kong, Mr. Ye is a political adviser to Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Ms. Ip said Mr. Ye was appointed in 2015 because of his support of the Belt and Road initiative. Mr. Ye ânever attended any activities of our party, and never gave advice on our political development,â Ms. Ip said in an email.
The Rosneft deal gave CEFC a global profile. It agreed in September to buy a 14.2 percent stake in Rosneft from the oil trader Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority. Rosneft needed the support after Western governments grew increasingly critical of Mr. Putin and issued sanctions against Rosneft and other Russian companies. The deal broke a mold for Russian-Chinese energy deals, which had been tightly limited to state companies in both countries.
It is not clear how CEFCâs troubles will affect the Rosneft deal. In January, the head of Russiaâs second-largest bank, VTB, said it would lend CEFC about $5 billion to help with the acquisition. Two Rosneft spokesmen did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
CEFC is facing financial pressures. In a September filing, it disclosed debts of about $20 billion, an increase of 20 percent from the previous year. Last week, China Chengxin and United Credit downgraded CEFC on concerns about its mounting debt, saying that it faced âhigh pressure to pay back in the short termâ and that if the Rosneft deal fell through, âthe company will bear a huge loss.â
The arrest in the United States of Patrick Ho, the top executive at CEFCâs nonprofit arm, has extended its troubles beyond China. A former civil servant, Mr. Ho has been accused of offering millions of dollars in bribes to President Idriss DÃ©by of Chad and Ugandaâs foreign minister, Sam Kutesa, in exchange for oil rights in the two countries, according to United States government. Mr. DÃ©by and Mr. Kutesa have denied the allegations.
Federal prosecutors have said that Mr. Ho was using the charity as a scheme to hide the passing of bribes on behalf of CEFC, the company. The nonprofit hosted networking events that featured former American military officials and Chinese Peopleâs Liberation Army generals.
Mr. Ho, a former home affairs secretary in Hong Kong, has denied the charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and awaits trial in New York.
The American governmentâs complaint against Mr. Ho, 68, includes references to CEFC executives as well as the chairman, without naming Mr. Ye. The complaint also describes emails between Mr. Ho and CEFCâs chairman about the suspected bribes.
In court hearings, prosecutors have said the company and Mr. Ye are not targets. But, they have added, the investigation proceeds. To add to the mystery, the court in New York recently appointed a special officer to deal with documents that are expected to be classified.

Welcome to the Era of Presidents for Life,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049883075?accountid=14586,"In 1813, not long before the end of his reign, Napoleon Bonaparte told the Austrian foreign minister, Count Metternich, the downside of being a strongman. âMy reign will not outlast the day I have ceased to be strong and therefore to be feared,â Napoleon said. âYour sovereigns, who were born to the throne, can allow themselves to be defeated 20 times and will always return to their capitals.â
Napoleon knew better than anyone the difficulties of remaining in power forever, particularly if you werenât born to the throne. Years later, democratic institutions would resolve this problem by making it possible for a defeated leader to return by way of the ballot box. Electoral democracy made clear that the throne is never owned, only leased.
But the spirit of democracy was hardly limited to the idea that the will of the people is expressed through free and fair elections. That rulers should not be encouraged to outstay their welcomes and that their power must always be constrained played an instrumental role in the modern understanding of liberal democracy as well.
But this consensus, forged over centuries, is now being called into question.
Today some of the leaders of the worldâs most powerful countries, democracies and non-democracies alike, are fashioning themselves as modern-day emperors. They are concentrating power in their own hands with no plans to leave office in their lifetime. In their view it does not matter whether a country is a democracy or an autocracy; what matters is the quality of its leader. And they have a lot of support: At a time when mistrust of politicians is high, many people see strongman leaders as preferable to a corrupt political establishment.
No example of this trend is clearer or more significant than the vote this week by Chinaâs National Peopleâs Congress to abolish presidential term limits. Itâs not an exaggeration to say that this move signals the end of democracyâs hegemony as the worldâs political ideal.
In the days after President Xi Jinping of China announced his decision to abolish term limits, many analysts concluded that his attempt to become an actual emperor signaled Beijingâs ambition to openly challenge Americaâs global leadership. This is accurate, but itâs not the full story.
What is rarely discussed in this context is what the political scientist Ken Jowitt calls the âVersailles effect.â Looking at history, Professor Jowitt demonstrates how power can be best measured by the eagerness of others to imitate oneâs institutions and lifestyles.
In the 17th century, he argues, Louis XIV of France âcreated a remarkably powerful and prestigious regime, one mimicked from Germany to Russia, where mini-Versailles were built, French manners adopted, and the French language spoken by the elite.â In the 19th century, Britainâs Parliament became the object of political desire â Hungarians signaled their political ambitions by building a neo-Gothic Parliament building in Budapest as grandiose as the one in London. After World War II, the Stalinist regimes installed in Eastern Europe were all stamped with a similarly imposing and inhumane Stalinist architecture.
After the end of the Cold War, imitating the West signified being on the right side of history. Holding elections and writing American-style Constitutions was as important for the image of the nation as having a smartphone is for the self-esteem of a teenager. For Professor Jowitt, âin the post-Cold War era, playing golf for the non-Western elite was what wearing togas was for the non-Roman elite in the ancient world.â
And constraining a rulerâs power was one of the key ways that non-democracies adjusted to the age of democracy.
Thatâs why many undemocratic governments insisted on maintaining democratic trappings, in particular elections and term limits. In 2008, for example, Vladimir Putin of Russia resisted the temptation to change the Constitution to allow him a third consecutive term as president because he did not want his country to look like one of the Central Asian republics where presidents never leave their palaces. Even though the system was rigged, undemocratic governments knew it was important to at least pretend it wasnât. This â rather than the spread of liberal democracy â is the real evidence of democracyâs hegemony. Even China played along.
Until now.
In this sense, the Chinese Communist Partyâs decision to abolish presidential term limits will resound far beyond China. One could imagine Mr. Putin convincing himself that leaving the Kremlin in 2024, when his next term would conclude, is no longer necessary. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey may very well also be reassured that he could stay in power indefinitely. Elected leaders around the world could soon rush to tell their voters that a change of leadership is a dangerous idea. New constitutions will be written and old constitutions will be amended to mark the arrival of the new political fashion.
The arrival of this âemperorâs momentâ is bad news for Europe, where not having an emperor is at the very heart of the European project. It is also rotten news for the United States. But it may be a boon for President Trump, who could decide that after Americans have taught the Chinese how to play golf, itâs time for Americans to start imitating the Chinese. What if two presidential terms isnât enough time to make America great again?

"When Xi Speaks, Chinese Officials Jump. Maybe Too High.","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049885004?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â After Chinaâs president, Xi Jinping, ordered Beijing to cut its population, his protÃ©gÃ© ordered the bulldozing of the homes of tens of thousands of migrants. After Mr. Xi told northern Chinese provinces to cut smog, cadres junked home heaters and stoves, leaving residents shivering.
These days when Mr. Xi speaks, officials from the top of the Communist Party to the lowest village committees snap to unflinching attention. The pressure on them may grow now that Mr. Xi has swept away a constitutional term limit on his presidency, strengthening his grip over the country.
But as these recent cases suggest, Mr. Xiâs daunting power may undercut effective policy or provoke public ire when lower officials scramble over each other to meet or exceed expectations, often leading to overreach and disarray.
âWhenever China has large-scale, top-down campaigns or initiatives, there are problems with overzealous officials and over-compliance,â said Elizabeth Economy, an expert on Chinese domestic and foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who has written a book on policy under Mr. Xi.
âChina under Xi Jinping will be particularly prone to this challenge,â she said. âHe operates almost entirely in a top-down manner, and his emphasis on control means that feedback mechanisms â in terms of signals from both the market and civil society â donât function well.â
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Many Chinese people have welcomed Mr. Xiâs brusque, commanding way after what they saw as the listless rule of his predecessor, Hu Jintao. âOrders donât make it out of Zhongnanhaiâ â the party headquarters in Beijing â became a common lament under Mr. Hu, who handed the reins to Mr. Xi in 2012.
Since then, Mr. Xi has cast himself as a decisive, unwavering leader with a long-term plan to make China a prosperous and respected great power. On Sunday, the legislature, the National Peopleâs Congress, passed a constitutional amendment erasing a limit of two presidential terms and setting Mr. Xi on course to run China for at least another decade.
Mr. Xi began his second five-year term as president after a unanimous vote by legislators on Saturday. Officials have said that extending Mr. Xiâs time in office beyond this term will assure stable policies for decades. The swift, secretive way in which Mr. Xi secured his extended reign let officials know that Mr. Xi would bulldoze past any resistance to get his way.
âXi effectively is signaling to opponents of his policy agenda that they cannot wait him out and that they need to get on board with his agenda,â said Ryan Hass, a former director for China at the National Security Council who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. âHe wouldnât take this step, and expose himself to such risk, unless he felt it was needed to bust through opposition to his agenda.â
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Xi has already established sweeping authority, through his anticorruption drive, and by creating a plethora of new powers and leadership groups that channel decisions to him. His overhaul of the military also demonstrated a willingness to take on entrenched bureaucracies.
A reorganization of ministries and agencies revealed at the congress on Tuesday may let Mr. Xi and other leaders better steer bureaucracies. And a new government lineup, to be announced on Monday, is likely to put Mr. Xiâs close allies atop his administration, making it easier to communicate and refine orders. One such ally, Wang Qishan, became vice president on Saturday.
But Mr. Xiâs centralization of power over the sprawling bureaucracy can also create confusion and overshooting.
Officials are often reluctant to risk making decisions that draw suspicion of corruption or political disloyalty, a Beijing think tank said last year. But when ordered to act, cadres are often eager to avoid suspicion of sloth. The outcome, several experts said, can be a confounding mix of overreaction to orders and reluctance to act on oneâs own initiative.
âThings are shot out of the top of the party, and theyâre unworkable when theyâre implemented,â said James McGregor, the chairman of greater China for APCO Worldwide, who advises companies dealing with Chinese officialdom. âItâs very hard to get an official to make decisions these days, because theyâre all scared of doing the wrong thing.â
Chinaâs top-down system has long been prone to overshooting. But several factors may magnify such problems in Mr. Xiâs next term.
In recent years, he has installed officials loyal to him across most provinces and ministries, and ardent supporters have sworn unquestioning obedience. Their awed obedience can encourage rigid enforcement of even vague or conflicting policies. Officials rarely suffer serious punishment for over-eagerly imposing Mr. Xiâs orders.
âUnless loyalty is absolute, it is absolute disloyalty,â Li Hongzhong, one of the avid loyalists promoted by Mr. Xi into the partyâs top ranks, said in 2016.
Mr. Xiâs efforts to break down walls between the party and government bureaucracies may discourage midlevel technocrats from improving policies. And Mr. Xiâs crackdown on rights lawyers, rights advocates, independent-minded journalists and online debate has silenced many voices who could question misguided government decisions.
Nobody sees such overreach producing anything as calamitous as Maoâs Great Leap Forward and subsequent famine. But Sun Liping, a well-known sociologist at Tsinghua University in Beijing, has warned against a mobilized bureaucracy stoking excessive zeal among subordinates.
âThis mobilizing form of government sometimes evolves into a race between officials. âIf youâre tough, then Iâll be even tougher. If you go to extremes, Iâll go further,ââ Professor Sun wrote about recent cases of official overreach in an essay that spread on Chinaâs internet last month before being censored.
âEverything in one fell blow, thunderous bombast, magnified down layer after layer, and then after the task is completed, just chicken feathers everywhere,â Professor Sun wrote, using a slang phrase for scant accomplishments.
Late last summer, to cut coal use in northern China and replace it with cleaner natural gas, officials tore out coal stoves and suspended coal deliveries. But when cold weather arrived, natural gas supplies fell short because planned pipelines had not all been finished.
Mr. Xi had ordered Beijing to reduce its population at least as early as 2014. But the effort progressed fitfully until last year, when Mr. Xiâs protÃ©gÃ©, Cai Qi, apparently eager to make his mark as the new party chief in Beijing, seized on a deadly apartment building fire to push mass demolitions. Tens of thousands ended up scrambling for shelter after losing their homes.
Officials are also racing to turn Mr. Xiâs biggest visions into reality, including Xiongâan New Area, the new model city planned for a stretch of land 80 miles south of Beijing. Mr. Xi began vocally promoting the idea about a year ago.
Not all of Mr. Xiâs policies appear prone to waves of excess zeal. Since destabilizing policy gyrations in 2015, financial policy has settled down, said Barry Naughton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies Chinese economic policymaking. But if Chinaâs economy hits a rough patch, presenting difficult choices between shoring up growth and reining in debt, that stability may not last.
âIt seems to me that bandwagoning, sycophancy, toadying are all becoming much more fundamental,â Professor Naughton said. âThatâs got to change the way the system functions as a whole.â

A Beijing Bookstore Where George Washington Is on the Shelves,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049897399?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â After the brutal suppression of Chinaâs 1989 democracy movement, Liu Suli, a student leader who had narrowly escaped being gunned down near Tiananmen Square, recalled a boyhood dream as he brooded in his prison cell.
If he owned a bookstore, he had mused at the age of 7, he wouldnât have to spend money on books. From behind bars, and with his entrepreneurial drive still intact, he saw his dream in a different light. A bookstore might be a more plausible way to pursue the freedom of ideas that he and hundreds of thousands of others had failed to win with public protest.
He got out of jail fairly quickly. The authorities lightened up a bit. He opened a bookstore and ordered an eclectic range of volumes that leaned toward philosophy, history, political science and an ample dose of Western thought.
And now the All Sages Bookstore, a haven of precisely arranged shelves and display tables, thrives on the low-rent second floor of a nondescript building near Peking University.
A survivor of Beijingâs ferocious property market â it has moved three times since 1993 â and the governmentâs extremely tight censorship in the era of President Xi Jinpingâs rule, the store represents an independent political spirit in an authoritarian one-party state.
A large image of Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher and freethinker, stands out among a galaxy of literary posters lining the wall of the entry staircase, a taste of whatâs to come.
âChina is not a liberal society, itâs not a free country,â Mr. Liu said, sitting in a quiet corner of the Thinkers Cafe, a mellow hangout within the store that meanders along a side corridor to a small back room furnished with antique Chinese furniture.
âBut the bookstore is a way to express our longing for freedom and our hope for the establishment of a free society,â he said.
A new patron would be forgiven for believing the owner had a lively sense of irony. One of the first books to catch the eye on the front table is an 11th edition of âRobertâs Rules of Order.â
The book is a recent hot seller. That is not because members of the Communist Party want to introduce parliamentary procedures written by a 19th-century American Army major to their gatherings. Chinese executives and entrepreneurs buy the volume for business reasons: to learn how to conduct a product conference, or manage a sales convention, Mr. Liu said.
A guide to running a democratic legislature, âHow Parliament Works,â by the British politicians Robert Rogers and Rhodri Walters, first published in 1987, is also on the front table.
âThis is more politically sensitive,â Mr. Liu said. âUnfortunately, it is not as popular as Roberts.â
All Sages has the feel of a well-ordered, smaller version of the Strand Bookstore in Manhattan, though judging from the photos on the walls, Mr. Liu prefers comparisons with the City Lights bookstore in San Francisco and Shakespeare & Company in Paris. Three cats â sometimes tiptoeing over the books on the tables â add some charm.
A Peopleâs Liberation Army veteran is in charge of the floor; he keeps displays in meticulous order and the wood floor noticeably clean. A few canvas bags and T-shirts with snappy slogans are for sale near the front desk, but the focus is on the books. The coffee in the cafe is not for lingering over.
A banner in English under the cash register reads, âI cannot live without books.â A copy of the Declaration of Independence hangs by the front door.
The clientele seems to be as varied as the books. The store is strategically located, within walking distance of Chinaâs premier university campus, but people from all over the country drop by.
On a recent weekend, a manager of a chemical company in the southern city of Shenzhen pushed a trolley full of books to the cashier for dispatch home by air courier. High-ranking military officers, party officials, rich society figures and celebrity entrepreneurs are all customers.
âItâs a secret what they buy,â Mr. Liu said. âBut take a look at the books, and you will see.â
The books in All Sages are all in Chinese. That makes the selection dependent not only on Mr. Liuâs broad-ranging tastes, but on the Chinese publishing houses.
They, in turn, are subject to the Communist Party censors who control what is published by Chinese authors and foreign writers translated into Chinese.
The censorship is not a precise art, but it is a constant presence. Internal party guidelines on what is prohibited are passed from the propaganda apparatus to the bosses of the publishing houses, sometimes on a daily basis. They are never made public. Nor is any list of banned books.
Some basic rules prevail, Mr. Liu said. The first motivation of the censors is protection of the Communist Party. âAnything that explains the Communist Party as a threat is a red line,â he said.
This leads to some striking choices. Books about the Soviet Unionâs labor camps are banned, but accounts of the Nazi concentration camps are tolerated. Histories of Castroâs rule in Cuba are not translated much; Cubaâs medical system compared too favorably with Chinaâs overcrowded hospitals.
With about 600 large, state-run publishing houses and 3,000 smaller publishers attached to government agencies, some titles that annoy the government sometimes slip through the net. Publishers tend to be liberals and lovers of literature, and some of them want to publish good books. Some push the parameters.
So in an exception to the rule against maligning a Communist Party, one of Mr. Liuâs favorites, Arthur Koestlerâs novel âDarkness at Noon,â about the Soviet gulag, was available in China for many years.
It was last published in 2006, however, and now appears to be banned. Secondhand editions of Koestlerâs classic are available online for $50. The original price: $1.50.
Among the steady sellers at All Sages are books on American history and biographies of the early presidents â Washington and Jefferson in particular â and of Benjamin Franklin. The interest in Americaâs founding fathers is tied up with a thirst to know how America became a democratic and global power, Mr. Liu said.
Recent political books about presidential election campaigns do not appeal much to his clientele, Mr. Liu said. He said he would read Michael Wolffâs âFire and Fury,â due out in Chinese soon, before stocking it.
Two standbys for Western liberals â Hannah Arendtâs âThe Origins of Totalitarianismâ and George Washingtonâs Farewell Address, which outlines his argument for term limits â have always sold well.
In the last several weeks, both works circulated on the Chinese internet, in a quiet protest against Mr. Xiâs decision to scrap the Chinese Constitutionâs two-term limit for presidents. Most likely, the censors never read what Washington had to say, Mr. Liu said.
Weekends are the busiest time at the store, and on a recent Saturday the narrow aisles were packed, especially around the nonfiction shelves. Fiction is not the storeâs strength.
There is plenty of Margaret Atwood and Alice Munro but no Joan Didion. Books on feminism merit only two shelves, a function of slow demand.
In the philosophy section, Sue Ping, 29, a Tsinghua University M.B.A. student dressed in a white sweater, jeans and a black beret, was searching for Platoâs âThe Republic.â âFor me, itâs paradise,â Ms. Ping said of the store. âI buy online but I come because I like the atmosphere. Itâs very open, you feel welcome.â
A few shelves away, Daisy Fu, 45, a primary school science teacher, who came with her husband on their motorbike, was deciding whether to buy a book about North Korea. âA bookstore is a symbol of culture; we need it,â she said. âEven though I donât come often, itâs important to know I can come and walk among the books.â
One book that Mr. Liu knows he will never be able to stock stands out. Works critical of Mao Zedong are automatically banned, and a sensational memoir, âA Life of Chairman Maoâ by Li Zhisui, Maoâs personal doctor of many years, is considered a particular abomination. The book describes Mao as a tyrannical personality with a fiendish sexual appetite and appalling personal hygiene who suffered from a motor neuron disease in his last years.
âThere is literally no way to get this book in China,â Mr. Liu said. âJust imagine if I put two copies on the shelves. The minimum punishment would be a fine of $3,000. The medium-level punishment would be shutting down the bookstore. And the most extreme would be the bookstore owner jailed for three to five years.â

What the West Doesnât Get About Xi Jinping,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049898818?accountid=14586,"The recent decision by Chinaâs National Peopleâs Congress to abolish term limits for the office of the president has sent shock waves through the West: Xi Jinping, the current officeholder, is suddenly being described as a new Confucian autocrat, overseeing a state still governed by a Marxist-Leninist party, presiding over a selectively capitalist economy, with ambitions to make his country a global superpower.
This sense of shock says more about the West than China. For the last five years, Western leaders and analysts have often projected onto China an image of their preferred imaginings, rather than one reflecting the actual statements of Chinaâs own leaders, or in the physical evidence of Chinese statecraft. These have long pointed to a vastly different reality.
Mr. Xi has not suddenly changed. From early on, he demonstrated an unmatched level of political skill in rapidly consolidating power. To get to the top, he has outflanked, outmaneuvered, marginalized and then removed all his principal opponents. The story of his remarkable ascent is hardly a secret. And itâs certainly not for the faint-hearted.
His anti-corruption campaign has been a master class in political warfare; since 2013 he has used it to clean up the party, clean out any potential challengers and insert his loyalists into broad swaths of the government, with himself at the top. And heâs not finished yet: A âNational Supervisory Commissionâ is now being established to take this campaign beyond the ranks of the party to the entire country.
Mr. Xi now chairs six top-level âleading small groupsâ as well as a number of central committees and commissions, covering every major area of policy. So-called Xi Jinping Thought is being incorporated into the Constitution â a unique arrangement for a sitting president (unlike his predecessors, who had to wait until they were out of office to have their âthoughtâ incorporated). In this light, the abolition of term limits on his office is just the icing on the cake; even without this change, Mr. Xi was likely to remain Chinaâs paramount leader through the 2020s.
Much of the focus has been on Mr. Xiâs ânew authoritarianism.â But there is a danger that in doing so analysts miss the broader changes in Chinaâs overall national direction. For the last few years China has been returning to parts of its old Marxist-Leninist ideological orthodoxy, after four decades of policy pragmatism. Along with this change, the Chinese Communist Party is regaining its institutional status over the policy machinery of the Chinese state; before, the party had focused on ideology, while professionals at the various departments of state handled the complex questions of policy and governance.
Today the locus of policy power has shifted from the State Council to the Politburo Standing Committee, including on the core question of the economy. This is a critical change from the days of the previous premier, Zhu Rongji. Mr. Xi believes the party must play a vital role in managing the economy while holding the country together, as Chinaâs transformation into a global great power continues.
There is danger here. Mr. Xi is not an economist, and his premier, Li Keqiang, technically responsible for the economy, is politically weak. This sets up a potential tension between the party and the presidentâs desire for control over the economy and the partyâs previous plans for further economic reform.
In 2013, the party released a blueprint for the next generation of economic change â transforming China from an old model of high growth, based on low-wage, labor-intensive manufacturing for export and supplemented by high levels of state investment in basic economic infrastructure, to a new model accepting lower, sustainable growth rates based on expanding domestic consumption, the services sector and the replacement over time of state-owned enterprises with a new generation of private companies like Alibaba.
However, over the past five years, the pace of reform has slowed, in large part because the party has feared losing control. The 13th National Peopleâs Congress has promised to accelerate the reform program once more, with a renewed commitment to put âthe marketâ at the center of the economy. We will see.
Perhaps the greatest analytical error across the West has been the view that Xi Jinping would want to continue to sustain the liberal, international rules-based order once its economic power began to rival that of the United States. Again, this hope goes against the well-known facts: China has long said that it sees the existing order as one invented by the victors of the last world war, one in which China did not have a seat at the table.
China has never shared the Westâs view of human rights. It has long sought to weaken the powers of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. China has at best had an ambivalent attitude to free trade â just look at its qualified support for the World Trade Organization, its opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its own long history of mercantilism.
And as for the global security order, China has never changed its hostility to the global system of American military alliances, in particular those in the Asia Pacific, which it has long attacked as legacies of the Cold War. Thatâs in addition to Chinaâs assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.
For these reasons, Mr. Xi has explicitly called for âa new type of great power relations,â âa new type of international systemâ emerging out of the âcurrent struggle for the international orderâ and a new type of activist Chinese diplomacy that puts to bed Deng Xiaopingâs dictum of âhide your strength, bide your time, and never take the lead.â Hence its efforts to foster an alternative multilateral system with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Belt and Road Initiative.
Over time Mr. Xi would like to turn the page on the liberal Western order and write a new chapter in world history. If China in the next decade becomes the largest economy in the world with Mr. Xi still likely its leader, the countryâs economic success would be based on a form of state capitalism that rejects the notion that rising income parallels broader economic liberalization and political democracy.
None of us knows how much Mr. Xi will seek to apply the principles of this âChina modelâ to the wider international order. There will be tensions here. But we should be very clear about what Mr. Xi wants for China itself, rather than seeing it through the rose-colored glasses of the West, still shaped by the images of Deng Xiaopingâs China, a quarter of a century ago. Xi Jinpingâs China is radically different.

Shining a Cleansing Light on Chinaâs Dark Secrets,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049901698?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Shen Zhihua, bon vivant, former businessman, now Chinaâs foremost Cold War historian, has set himself a near-impossible task. He wants China to peel back its secrets, throw open its archives and tell its citizens what went on between China and the United States, between China and North Korea, and much more.
Even before the hard-line era of President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party has acted like a supersensitive corporation, blocking highly regarded historians like Mr. Shen from peering too deeply. Precious documents have been destroyed, stolen or kept under seal by librarians skilled at deflecting the inquiries of even the most tenacious researchers.
âChinese leaders have historical baggage,â Mr. Shen, who will turn 68 next month, said over a glass of white wine at a handsome villa hidden behind a high wall in the heart of Beijing. His tousled graying hair, casual jacket and open-necked shirt depart sharply from the buttoned-down party look.
âThe party was popular, but after 1949 the party made a lot of mistakes: land reform, the Cultural Revolution, the Great Leap Forward. People might ask: âSince you have made so many mistakes, why are you still in power?â â
The party is unnecessarily nervous, he argues. âIf you look at Chinese history, none can replace the Communist Party. Most of the elite is in the party. The party shouldnât worry about being challenged. If I was running the propaganda department, I would say: âThose mistakes were made in the past, not now, and we need to learn from our mistakes.â â
The party frets so much that Mr. Shen â who possesses a blue-ribbon political pedigree â cannot get access even to documents deemed accessible under a law passed in 1996 that said archives would be open to the public after 30 years. The law has never been followed.
Hence, Chinaâs version of Nixonâs visit in 1972 and its accounts of the precursor trips by Henry Kissinger remain largely unknown. What went on between Mao and the North Korean leader Kim Il-sung during the Korean War is only sketchily understood from Chinaâs point of view.
With Xia Yafeng of Long Island University, Mr. Shen is the author of the seminal work on Chinaâs relations with North Korea, âA Misunderstood Friendship: Mao Zedong, Kim Il-sung and Sino-North Korean relations 1949-1976,â which will be published in English later this year. The book relies heavily on the archives in Moscow and Central Europe that tumbled open after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
But he made some lucky finds in libraries in northeastern China, too, while also extracting papers from reluctant librarians at Chinaâs major archives. And through his connections with top party officials, he secured access to a memorandum of conversations between Mao and the North Korean leader, a trove that had never before been made public.
In the book, Mr. Shen demolishes the myth that China and North Korea were tightly allied, âas close as lips to teeth,â as Chinaâs propagandists insisted. He shows that even before the start of the Korean War in 1950, relations between the two newly installed Communist parties were tense. Mr. Kim, the grandfather of the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, invaded South Korea without notifying Mao. The Chinese were informed three days after the fact.
Despite his current pursuits, Mr. Shen is hardly the scholarly sort who has spent his life buried in the stacks. He started out as a crack Navy pilot, but that ended when he was falsely accused of murder by a jailhouse snitch. Mr. Shen was freed after the informer recanted, but was jailed again in the early 1980s on an accusation of spying for the United States.
Mr. Shen says the spying charge stemmed from his giving some articles and documents on Chinese agrarian reform to an American student who, unbeknown to him, was suspected by the authorities of having links to the C.I.A.
During his two years in prison, he invented a way to write by fashioning an empty toothpaste tube into a pen. He asked for books on Mao, Marx and Lenin (âThe prison authorities didnât dare deny thatâ), and wrote notes for his first work â on Soviet agriculture â in the margins of the Soviet Unionâs âNew Economic Policy,â using an upturned washbowl balanced on his knees as a desk.
When he got out of jail the second time, he had weathered enough to know that his personal diary â a foot-high stack of notebooks going back to high school â was a time bomb, one that the authorities could use for blackmail.
So in 1985, before heading to southern China to begin a career in business, he burned the diaries, tossing them page by page into a coal furnace, an odd act for someone who would later campaign for the preservation of records. âVery bittersweet,â he said. âI didnât want to leave anything in writing which might cause me further trouble.â
It was the period of Chinaâs economic reforms, and Mr. Shen became a successful gold trader, eventually earning enough to quit the business and devote himself full-time to his historical research.
Mr. Shen grew up in Beijing, the son of a successful Communist Party bureaucrat who rose to become the second in command of Chinaâs prison system. Despite Mr. Shenâs run-ins with the communist system, he holds an almost perfect Communist Party pedigree: his father had joined Mao at his army base in Yanâan during the civil war and his father-in-law was a good friend of the father of the current president, Mr. Xi.
He appreciates that delving into the Communist Partyâs past requires functioning like a guerrilla historian, not a starchy academic, so he has taken his drive for transparency beyond Chinaâs borders.
His government-funded Research Institute for Asian Neighborhood Studies in Shanghai allows Mr. Shen and his students to travel to one-party states in Asia and Eastern Europe to collect documents that are then copied and cataloged at the institute.
North Korea would seem a natural hunting ground. On a visit to Beijing, a senior North Korean official invited Mr. Shen to Pyongyang to look at the archives, airfare and lodging paid, but he declined. âI was worried if I went, I wouldnât be allowed out.â
During his travels around China, he is not shy about offering his opinions on the current situation on the Korean Peninsula. He caused a stir last year when he told a closed-door seminar that China would be better off allying with South Korea than the North. (The lecture later circulated on the internet.)
âYou can see how much attention and admiration he commands when he speaks at forums in China,â said Charles Kraus, a historian who specializes in China at the Wilson Center in Washington, where Mr. Shen is a senior fellow. âIn Changchun in 2015 I remember there were even Shen Zhihua fanboys waiting in the hotel lobby hoping to catch a glimpse of him and get him to autograph books.â
Mr. Shen will never give up the chase for Chinaâs historical secrets. But he wonders if the really important documents even exist at this point.
When they left office, many senior officials ransacked the files. Zhou Enlaiâs wife is rumored to have taken archives and shredded them. Maoâs wife is believed to have destroyed documents, too.
The Chinese Communist Party kept far fewer records than the party in the Soviet Union, where the unleashing of the archives led to a whole new industry of Cold War history.
âRussia has a tradition of keeping records,â he said. âThe Chinese Communist Party grew out of an underground operation, was very secretive and didnât record many things. Of the 1950s Politburo meetings there are few records. They never wrote things down.â
He is thankful his political connections have helped him to at least get in the door of important Chinese archives. But being inside is often not enough.
A friend in the bureaucracy once explained the problem, he said: â âYou know about the 1996 law,â â the friend told him, â âBut you donât know about the 10 noâs. Thereâs no looking up religion, diplomacy, personal affairs of state leaders.â I said, âWhat can I look up?â The person said, âBasically nothing.â â

Thereâs no looking up religion, diplomacy, personal affairs of state leaders.â I said, âWhat can I look up?â The person said, âBasically nothing.â â

Trumpâs China Policy Has a Flaw: It Makes China the Winner,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2019115869?accountid=14586,"Since the days of the Nixon administration nearly 50 years ago, American policy has aimed to steer China out of its isolation to prosper in the global market economy. There neednât be conflict between the established superpower and the emerging giant, the best strategic minds argued. As it grew rich, they reasoned, China could be integrated peacefully into the institutional framework built by the Western powers from the rubble of World War II.
The proposition fit with the âliberal peaceâ view of foreign relations: that nations engaged in intense economic intercourse would find it too costly to go to war. American businesses that flocked to China to tap its cheap labor and huge consumer market after its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 enthusiastically agreed with the approach.
That strategy, it appears, is over.
President Trumpâs announcement last week that the United States would impose a battery of tariffs against as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese goods while restricting Chinese investments in American technology companies has set policy onto a different, more belligerent path. China is now, in the presidentâs words, an âeconomic enemy.â
Interestingly, not all scholars have opposed the change of tone. Many foreign policy experts agree that China is not playing by the rules. American businesses, which typically endorsed forbearance to protect their market access to China, have grown frustrated at its appropriation of their intellectual property.
John Mearsheimer, a foreign policy expert at the University of Chicago, doesnât buy the idea of liberal peace. In âThe Tragedy of Great Power Politics,â published in 2001, he wrote, âA wealthy China would not be a status quo power but an aggressive state determined to achieve regional hegemony.â
And yet Mr. Trumpâs hard-line approach to China seems destined to fail. Taking a stand against Chinaâs abusive behaviors is not necessarily wrong. The problem with the presidentâs game plan is that it is inconsistent with all the other diplomatic initiatives he has taken so far. The tangle of stabs and swipes at allies and rivals alike, in the service of ill-conceived goals like closing a trade deficit, serves China more than it does the United States.
âTrump has been a godsend for China,â noted Eswar Prasad, an expert on trade at Cornell University who once headed the China division at the International Monetary Fund. âChina has manipulated the rules, but Trumpâs response is counterproductive.â
China is clearly chafing at the rules put together by the West. It openly disagrees with the postwar apportionment of the South China Sea. It is more than willing to flout the World Trade Organizationâs intellectual property rules to build its domestic technological expertise.
Several Chinese initiatives â its One Belt, One Road effort to build infrastructure to connect to Central Asia, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership it hopes to negotiate with its Asian neighbors, and its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank â are aimed at building an institutional framework to rival the trade agreements and multinational financial institutions supported by the West.
As a counterweight, Washington could strengthen the global institutions that support its own view of fair play, like the World Trade Organization, which the United States took such trouble to build. It could build new ones, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, open to China as long as it agreed to abide by the rules. It could nail down its vast web of alliances in Asia and around the world â to ensure it wouldnât confront China alone.
That is not, however, what Mr. Trump is doing. Ditching the Trans-Pacific Partnership, imposing new tariffs on Japanese steel and hinting that the United States may even walk away from the W.T.O. all serve Chinaâs goal of undermining the arrangements and institutions that stand in its way. âTrump is a blessing for them,â Mr. Prasad argued. âAll they were trying to do, Trump is ramping up a couple of levels.â
Where might Mr. Trump lead relations between the two biggest economies on earth?
The outcome doesnât have to be horrible. Mr. Trumpâs willingness to slap real punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, regardless of the collateral damage they may cause on the American economy, gives Washington some leverage in its face-off with Beijing. It could be deployed productively.
A decade ago, American pressure gave the Chinese government political space to let its currency appreciate and cool its runaway export growth. Today, American pressure could help Beijing make an argument to curb Chinaâs excess capacity in steel and aluminum.
Washingtonâs threats could also help Chinese leaders build a legal system to protect intellectual property, a necessary step if China is to become a more innovative economy that develops its own technologies. Mr. Trump could even get China to offer more market access for agricultural products and other valuable American exports.
While Professor Mearsheimer argues that the United States should aim to contain China by preventing it from expanding its influence or conquering territory in Asia and by building alliances to hem in Chinese power, Robert J. Art, a professor of international relations at Brandeis University, argues that the United States and China can make a deal.
China and the United States would both benefit from stability in the Taiwan Strait and a peaceful reunification of Taiwan and China, Professor Art said. Both would prefer a denuclearized Korean Peninsula as well as a peaceful resolution of Chinaâs maritime disputes. Both would prefer that Japan not acquire nuclear weapons. Notably, both would prefer maintaining an open economic order.
Mr. Trump seems uninterested in either path. Indeed, the uncertainty hanging over Americaâs relations with China is really a question about what the president ultimately wants. Is the objective to balance bilateral trade? Does he hope to slow Chinaâs growth, to prevent it from becoming a formidable rival? Both are probably unachievable.
Trade deficits cannot be negotiated away. The United States will run a deficit as long as it depends on foreign money to close the gap between what it saves and what it spends. Slowing Chinaâs growth unilaterally is also pretty much impossible. There are too many countries that have little sympathy for Mr. Trumpâs objectives and are willing to trade with Asiaâs biggest economy. Washington might slow Chinaâs technological progress but seems unlikely to stop it.
The worry among economists and foreign policy experts alike is that Mr. Trumpâs stand on China is determined by domestic politics alone. The president doesnât know what he wants out of a relationship with China, nor what the United States could feasibly achieve. He has figured out what his voters would like. That, apparently, is enough.
American workers are fed up with China. They believe the Asian giantâs entrance into the world economy cost them their jobs and undercut their wages. Up to a point, they are right. Their itch to punish it, however, is misguided. And allowing their irritation to shape American policy toward China is wrong.
The view that China would peacefully rise within the Westâs institutional framework may have proved hopelessly naÃ¯ve. Reorienting Washingtonâs China policy to fit the frustration of workers in Michigan could prove disastrous.

"If Thereâs a U.S.-China Trade War, China May Have Some âUnconventional Weaponsâ","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2022298985?accountid=14586,"Until Thursday afternoon, there had been a reassuring sense of restrained, tit-for-tat reciprocity in the trade skirmish between the United States and China.
But if this spirals into a bigger conflict between the worldâs two biggest economies â something that seemed to become more likely Thursday evening with President Trumpâs threat to add $100 billion more in tariffs â itâs worth keeping something in mind: In a trade war, the usual rules of commerce may not apply.
That is doubly true in a potential trade war with China, for several reasons.
Because the country exports far more in goods to the United States than it imports, China simply doesnât have as much room to keep up with escalating American tariffs, especially given the Chinese governmentâs desire to cushion its citizens from higher prices for food staples.
Moreover, China has in the past proved willing to use a wide range of government powers to achieve commercial objectives â from campaigns against out-of-favor companies in state media to selective, stepped-up regulatory enforcement. And if things really get nasty, the United States and China are financially intertwined in ways that China could seek to exploit â though not without creating risks for a country holding $1.2 trillion in United States Treasury bonds.
âOne of the very important tools that the Chinese have is the ability to make life difficult for a large number of American businesses,â said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who studies Chinese economic relations. âThey have all of these unconventional weapons that are not covered by traditional trading rules that could be potent weapons in actually fighting a trade war.â
The details of what China might do are speculative. Thus far, Chinaâs government has reacted to new tariff actions by the Trump administration with relatively restrained words and promises of proportional responses to the American governmentâs actions.
The Americans put tariffs on steel and aluminum; China responds by taxing American pork. The Trump administrationâs plans to tax $50 billion worth of Chinese imports is met with threats by the Chinese to subject $50 billion worth of American products to the same.
Those tariffs wonât even go into effect until after a comment period, setting up a potentially long period of lobbying and negotiation that could rein in their scope or even delay them indefinitely.
But just because matters have been calibrated thus far doesnât mean they will stay that way. American financial markets have been swinging wildly in recent weeks as investors revise their predictions for what might come next.
The Tough Math of Tit-for-Tat
As President Trump often notes, the United States does run a large trade deficit with China â especially if you look only at goods, and donât count the value of services. That means that if China seeks to match tariffs on goods â a classic tit-for-tat approach â China runs out of âtatsâ pretty quickly.
In 2017, the United States imported $506 billion in goods from China while exporting only $131 billion in goods to China, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
âIt mathematically means that China canât match the U.S. dollar for dollar,â said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
So, for example, if the Trump administration follows through on the presidentâs suggestion to consider expanding the tariffs to cover $100 billion more of goods, it would strain the Chinese government to respond in a dollar-for-dollar manner.
And thatâs before you account for the Chinese governmentâs reluctance to put tariffs on goods that might carry some political or strategic cost.
For example, in its planned retaliatory tariffs, the Chinese government included narrow-body aircraft but not wide-body aircraft. This makes sense strategically, Mr. Setser argued, because only two companies in the world make wide-body planes: Boeing and Airbus. If China put a tariff on planes from the American Boeing but not the European Airbus, it would lose leverage with Airbus with which to extract favorable prices and access to cutting-edge technology.
China has already imposed tariffs on the easy stuff: luxury goods like American wine and liquor, and agricultural goods that are considered luxuries within China, like almonds and pistachios. It is unlikely there will be uprisings in the streets of Shanghai if Kentucky bourbon gets more expensive.
But in the latest round, China has said it will raise tariffs on American soybeans. That is likely to cause President Trump political problems in farm states, but it also risks raising food costs within China. Itâs a fair bet, then, that China views remaining options as even more problematic for the prices of staple goods or the countryâs industrial strategy.
In other words, for China the low-hanging fruit is gone. If this trade battle continues to escalate, China will have to bear a greater cost.
Commercial Guerrilla Warfare
That reality could push China to seek other buttons to press. And while there is no recent precedent of a trade war to draw from, the Chinese governmentâs actions in other types of disputes offer a potential road map.
For one thing, American companies do significant business in China that doesnât show up in trade data. When Apple assembles an iPhone in Zhengzhou and sells it in Shanghai, that doesnât count as international trade, though the profits accrue to the benefit of a California-based company. The Chinese government has any number of tools to try to weaken that business if it wishes. It could decide that phones made by a foreign company are a national security threat, or shut down plants because of minor regulatory problems.
âThatâs the kind of thing they could reduce dramatically if they wanted to,â said Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. âTo their credit, they have not hinted that this is on their agenda, and they seem to be sticking to this idea that their response will be reciprocal and not escalatory. But they have plenty of other options.â
Making life difficult for American companies in China as retaliation in a trade war need not be formal and widely publicized. American automakers who make cars in China might find their local joint-venture partners squeezing them out. Regional governments might send safety inspectors to plants of American companies so often as to disrupt production.
There are more public options, too. For example, in 2013, Chinese state media accused Jaguar Land Rover and Audi of overcharging buyers for car parts, which analysts viewed as part of a campaign to pressure those automakers to locate more manufacturing in China.
Bruising in the Bond Market?
For years, American politicians have fretted about Chinaâs role as the United Statesâ largest creditor; the nation has accumulated a huge stockpile of Treasury bonds over the last 20 years.
Could China use its role as No. 1 lender to exert pressure in a trade war?
It would be a risky maneuver, in which China itself would potentially have much to lose. But it canât be ruled out.
If China were to suddenly unload some of its holdings, or even signal an intention to buy fewer dollar assets in the future, that would probably cause long-term interest rates in the United States to rise, at least temporarily. And this would cause some pain in the United States, as borrowing costs â whether for the federal government or individual home buyers â would rise.
But it would also drive down the value of Chinaâs existing bond portfolio, meaning China could lose billions. And it would tend to push down the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, which would actually help the United States attain more advantageous trade terms.
Even after all that, bond prices would most likely readjust over time as other buyers took advantage of the rise in interest rates. In the medium term, the performance of the United States economy and actions of the Federal Reserve do more to determine bond prices than the decisions of a single buyer or seller, even one as large as China.
That doesnât mean there isnât room to cause some near-term pain and disruption. âThe Chinese have some leverage to rattle U.S. bond markets, even if the threat of substantive action is not very credible,â Mr. Prasad said.
Given that a trade war with such a major trading partner is without precedent in modern times, we donât really know what it would look like. But itâs a safe bet that Chinese officials are already thinking through their options in case that is where the latest round of economic saber rattling ultimately leads.

Chinaâs Communists Rewrite the Rules for Foreign Businesses,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2025008019?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â One hammer and sickle at a time, the Communist Party is making its way deeper into everyday Chinese life â and that includes the foreign companies doing business there.
Honda, the Japanese automaker, changed its legal documents to give the party a say in how its Chinese factories are run. A Chinese state oil giant vowed to put the party front and center in its joint ventures with foreign partners.
And Cummins, the engine maker from Indiana, felt the partyâs reach, too, when it tried to appoint a new manager for one of its China businesses. The party said no.
âIn the past the American general manager did not understand why the party was involved in decision making,â said Hu Hongwei, the partyâs representative to Cumminsâs China joint venture, according to The Peopleâs Daily, the partyâs official newspaper.
But Cumminsâs Chinese partner then rewrote the businessâs articles of association to give the party more power, Ms. Hu said. The American manager âhas begun to understand it,â she added.
The Communist Partyâs rise in the Chinese offices and factories of foreign companies is yet another challenge for multinationals doing business in the country, which has the worldâs second-largest economy, trailing only that of the United States. President Trumpâs protectionism has put American companies in particular in the middle of a brewing fight between Beijing and Washington.
Foreign companies face growing pressure to share sensitive technology. The Chinese authorities have stepped up efforts to foster a new generation of homegrown competitors meant to someday replace foreign companies.
Should a trade dispute between China and the United States worsen, Beijing could be moved to intensify the partyâs role in foreign business even further, creating yet another headache for businesses operating in China.
The partyâs expanding presence in business is part of a broader push by Xi Jinping, Chinaâs president and the partyâs top leader, to make it stronger. He has reshaped education to include more Communist Party mythology and increased the partyâs role in Chinaâs military. Mr. Xiâs take on Communism â called âXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Eraâ â has been unveiled with great fanfare across the country.
In the business realm, dozens of Chinese state-controlled companies have changed their articles of incorporation to give the party a greater role, including the publicly traded units of some of the worldâs biggest companies, like Sinopec, ICBC and China Railway Group. The insurance giant China Pacific Insurance, for example, recently amended its articles of association to say that in key corporate decisions, âthe board of directors shall first seek for the opinion of the leading party group of the company.â
âWeâve never seen the party so forcefully articulate its own goals,â said Jude Blanchette, a senior adviser and China head at Crumpton Group. âCompanies are now trying to coordinate with the party in a way that doesnât sacrifice their own shareholder interest.â
The Communist Party has long been part of doing business in China. While party committees are a fixture in many foreign-managed workplaces, they were seen by foreign executives for years as more like social clubs. They would meet to read party announcements, recruit new members, make sure dues were collected and generally keep an eye on operations.
But on at least three occasions in recent months, foreign executives have been approached by their Chinese joint venture partners demanding that they involve internal party committees in strategic decisions, say lawyers and business executives.
âInfiltration by party operatives into the executive circle of foreign-invested enterprises is not extensively apparent at this time but things are certainly going in that direction,â said James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing whose clients include American multinational corporations.
He said several of his clients in joint ventures had received explicit requests to give their internal party organizations a greater say in the companyâs operations. At some companies, the requested language requires a board of directors to consult with the committee before making business decisions.
Foreign business associations in China have spoken out. In November, the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce said it was concerned about âproactive calls on foreign-invested companies to promote the development of the Communist Party of China within companies.â The European Chamber of Commerce has called such incidents a âgreat concernâ that would represent âa significant change from the legal framework under which joint ventures were negotiated and under which they have been operating successfully for decades.â
The creeping influence of the party in foreign offices and factories is a sensitive subject in a country where the party seems ready to punish anyone who questions its widening influence. Many companies are loath to discuss the issue.
Cummins, for example, declined to comment on the changes to its joint ventureâs articles of incorporation that gave the party greater power. Cummins had not âexperienced any challenges or impact due to the structure we have in place and the role of the Chinese Communist Party,â a spokesman said.
Cumminsâs Chinese partner, Dongfeng Motor Group, has recently taken steps to intensify the partyâs activities at its other joint ventures, according to an article last year from Xinhua, Chinaâs official news agency. They include ventures with Peugeot CitroÃ«n, the French automaker; Honda, of Japan; and Dana, the American auto parts maker.
Dongfengâs other partners, like Peugeot and Dana, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A Honda spokesman declined to comment about its partnership with Dongfeng.
However, the Honda spokesman confirmed that the party claimed a more assertive role in another joint venture with a different Chinese company, GAC Group.
GAC, an automaker owned by Guangzhou Automobile Group, is pushing its joint ventures to change their articles of association to give the party a greater role, a spokeswoman said. In addition to Honda, it has joint ventures with Toyota and Mitsubishi, both of which declined to comment.
In November, at the most important Communist Party meeting, which takes place every five years, Mr. Xi called on officials to strengthen the party in âgovernment, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west.â The message was quick to reach party members lower down in the ranks.
Soon after Mr. Xiâs speech, party officials in the central province of Hunan issued a notice to members instructing them to write the party into legal documents for private and state-owned companies alike. The document was accidentally made public when a local state-owned newspaper published it, but it was quickly taken down.
Over the past year, the state-owned oil giant Sinopec has begun to ask its foreign joint venture partners to legally require âparty-building work,â according to one executive with direct knowledge of the requests who was not authorized to speak publicly. Party building is an amorphous term that can mean general recruiting and educating but can also refer to more direct, specific activity. The foreign executive told Sinopec that putting the party in the joint ventureâs legal documents would pose major problems for the head office overseas.
Sinopec did not respond to several requests for comment.
Dongfeng Motors, Cumminsâs partner and one of Chinaâs biggest carmakers, has long had strong Communist Party ties.
Instructors at Communist Party schools have used Dongfengâs joint venture with Nissan as a model of how the party can be involved with business, according to the book âThe Partyâ by Richard McGregor. When the partnership was negotiated, Dongfeng insisted that the new company give the chief party representative a senior management role, with a salary and compensation for expenses.
Today, Dongfengâs Communist Party committees are working to expand their influence further. In other Dongfeng joint ventures, committees have tried to make the party more relevant for employees by holding social events.
In 2016, a group of employees from Dongfeng-Cummins traveled to the site of the Communist Partyâs first base, according to Dongfengâs website. On a rainy day, the group dressed in Red Army outfits, huddled together to hold a red flag with the hammer and sickle and smiled for the camera.

When TV Takes Part in Human Rights Abuse,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2028546837?accountid=14586,"Every once in a while people ask me about it. Journalists and diplomats who talk to me for the first time usually open with it. When I meet new people I donât mention it at all, and yet somehow the next time I see them they know all about it: the âconfessionâ I was forced to make on Chinese television in 2016.
The Chinese media has been long known to work with the state, or rather, Chinaâs Communist Party, to spread propaganda. It is now clear that the media outlets have also become active players in Chinaâs foreign policy. I didnât think about it that way when I first viewed, in extreme discomfort, my own televised confession. At the time, I thought of the scene as mere propaganda and an attempt to scare other foreign human rights workers.
But in February, when I watched Gui Minhai, a brave independent bookseller and a fellow Swede, paraded for the third time in front of the media, it became clear: These televised confessions are actually weapons of foreign policy.
They fit a clear pattern. A new report by the human rights group Safeguard Defenders, for which I was asked to provide testimony, reveals what goes on backstage. My experience, and that of the others who went through this ordeal, shows that these so-called confessions are produced in close collaboration with Chinese media outlets, usually before any legal proceedings have begun. They often follow a similar script: The subjects âconfess,â denounce others, praise the party and, most important, undermine foreign criticism of Chinaâs human rights abuses. Gui Minhaiâs latest âconfessionâ was a point-by-point rebuttal of Swedenâs objections to Chinaâs handling of his case.
Occasionally, there are moments of comedy. I found it difficult to keep a straight face as I spoke to the journalist sent by China Central Television, or CCTV, the state television network. Both of us were sitting there holding pieces of paper, and my script had all the questions and answers written out for us to recite. It was absurdly stage-managed, with state security agents directing how I was to behave and speak.
The theater hides a grim reality: I read the script in exchange for freedom for me and my girlfriend. We were both held in solitary confinement inside one of Chinaâs secret prisons, which operate under the euphemism âresidential surveillance at a designated location.â Because of a severe medical condition, I feared that I would not survive in custody. Many victims endure far worse, including prolonged physical and mental abuse and the harassment or detention of their children and siblings.
The use of these secret prisons has been expanded under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, and they are only one example of his efforts to hold power ever more tightly. Television and other media are crucial tools of the Chinese Communist Party in its soft power push around the world. CCTVâs American unit, for example, claims to reach about 30 million households in the United States and won an Emmy Award in 2016.
These same Chinese media outlets, as well as some in Hong Kong, air forced confessions, which are illegal under Chinese law and are in violation of principles of human rights. After Iranâs government allegedly collaborated with security services and prosecutors to broadcast forced TV confessions, the European Union in 2013 imposed a visa ban and asset freezes on the head of the state-run broadcasting authority, which was also blacklisted by the United States. When American intelligence agencies said RT America, a television station backed by the Kremlin, had participated in a campaign to manipulate the 2016 election, the Justice Department forced RT America to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires it to regularly disclose financial information.
The United States should enforce similar requirements on all Chinese media outlets in the United States. And the United States should invoke the Global Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions on the people in power at Chinese media companies, as well as those within the Chinese police and state security apparatus who are responsible for these televised humiliations. The Magnitsky Act offers great power to target individuals, by freezing their U.S. assets and banning them from traveling to the United States.
America has applied the Global Magnitsky Act to people in China before for other human rights violations, and it should do the same for these abuses. With sanctions as leverage, the United States could also push for greater access to American media within China.
We should welcome and encourage Chinese media outlets to play a bigger role in a competition of ideas. The United States should not abandon its belief in free expression â thatâs why Americans have access to Chinese television. But the United States should also recognize that Chinaâs leaders are engaged in a sophisticated foreign policy game, using the reach of the media to multiply the impact of the abuse it directs at critics. The American response should be no less forceful.

The U.S. and China: More Alike Than Weâd Like?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2036823692?accountid=14586,"It is impossible to visit China these days and not compare and contrast the drama playing out in Beijing politics with the drama playing out in Washington politics. While the differences are many, I am sorry to report that some of the parallels are getting too close for comfort.
Letâs start with the fact that the anti-corruption crackdown by President Xi Jinping has created a climate of fear in China these days â whether about interacting with foreigners or saying the wrong thing or behaving too extravagantly so as to attract the state âanti-corruptionâ detectives.
But because âcorruptionâ has not been clearly defined â and can be used to get rid of anyone for any reason â people donât know where the line is, so theyâre extra cautious. Thatâs why during a week in Beijing the most frequent expression I heard was, âYouâre not quoting me on this, right?â
But if the Chinese are afraid to talk to one another, in America weâve forgotten how to talk to one another.
In Washington these days it is not uncommon for people to be invited to a dinner or a public gathering and think to themselves: âI hope none of them will be there.â And the them people are talking about is not someone of a different faith or race â which would be awful enough â but itâs someone just from a different political party.
In other words, in both Beijing and Washington, self-censorship, and biting oneâs tongue, is more rife than ever â but for different reasons. In Beijing itâs so you wonât get arrested. In Washington itâs so you wonât get into a fight. In both cases, though, the net results are fewer people talking truth across ideological lines.
At the same time, in China today, if youâre a Communist Party official or senior bureaucrat, you have to toe the ruling partyâs line or you could be quickly purged or imprisoned. In America today, if youâre a Republican Party congressman or senator, you, too, have to toe the ruling partyâs line or you could be quickly purged or primaried â or get a tweet in the back from the president.
But there is one difference: In Chinaâs ruling Communist Party, itâs never safe to criticize the president. In Americaâs ruling Republican Party, you can criticize the president, or vote your conscience, if youâre dying, retiring or whispering.
Or, as a dying Senator John McCain observed in his new book: âThis is my last term. â¦ Iâm freer than colleagues who will face the voters again. I can speak my mind without fearing the consequences much. And I can vote my conscience without worry.â
The Chinese government will not hesitate to put out propaganda to support the government or defend Chinaâs interests, whether the facts are true or not. Ditto Donald Trump and his White House. Last week The Washington Post reported: âIn the 466 days since he took the oath of office, President Trump has made 3,001 false or misleading claims, according to The Fact Checkerâs database that analyzes, categorizes and tracks every suspect statement uttered by the president. Thatâs an average of nearly 6.5 claims a day.â
I suspect President Xi has a far higher truth batting average in his public statements than President Trump.
The fawning and lack of skepticism with which China Central Television covers Xi, though, is indistinguishable from the fawning and lack of skepticism by âFox & Friendsâ and Sean Hannity when discussing Trump.
That probably partially explains why more and more Chinese do not think that we are as âexceptionalâ a nation as we think we are â and they are now ready to say so: loudly. I was struck by how many officials and experts at a Tsinghua University seminar I attended were so willing to baldly state that their top-down, one-party system of governance and state-directed capitalism was superior to our multiparty, democratic, free-market system.
And the two big pieces of evidence they always cited was that they never went through the kind of 2008 economic meltdown that we did, and their system never put up a leader as undisciplined, dishonest and unstable as Donald Trump (at least not since Mao).
On this I often pushed back on my Chinese interlocutors to be humbler and warier of what the future may hold. Their one-party, one-man decision-making system can make big decisions fast. But it can also make big wrong decisions fast. For instance, Bloomberg News reported in February: âIn 2008, Chinaâs total debt was about 141 percent of its gross domestic product. By mid-2017 that number had risen to 256 percent. Countries that take on such a large amount of debt in such a short period typically face a hard landing.â
But Xi and the Chinese Communist Party at least stimulated their economy in order to avoid a real economic crisis â for themselves and the world. Trump and his Republican Party just added $1.5 trillion to Americaâs debt to pay for tax cuts for businesses and individuals at a time when our economy was already on the rise. Trump did so knowing that he would be here to take credit for any boom â and be long gone when we have to do the belt-tightening necessary so that interest on the debt doesnât devour all nondefense spending and lead to a bust.
One contrast, Chinese are ready to sacrifice to make China great again. Trump wants to make America great again without asking us to do anything hard â just cut taxes and regulations for rich people and corporations and keep pumping fossil fuels, and not invest in public goods like education and infrastructure, which have been the real engines of Chinaâs resurgence.
Chinese foreign policy has always been transactional, saying to neighbors, âGive us access to your markets and we will build you infrastructure that we can both use â then we will be allies.â U.S. foreign policy, while it has always had its cynical, transactional side, particularly in the Cold War, has tended more toward, âShare our values and then we can be allies.â
But Trump clearly wants us to act more like China: âDonât show me your values. Show me your money and your arms purchases. Donât think of me as your ally. Think of me as your landlord. Pay for our protection and we can be friends.â
Fortunately, for now, one big difference remains: While Xi has cowed his news media, Trump, despite all his efforts to discredit our free press, has actually ended up invigorating it. Fox aside, itâs feistier than ever. And while institutions and the rule of law in China have always been a weak restraint on its leaders, institutions built over 250 years in America have continued to restrain Trump â for now.
But they will have to hold for at least another two and a half years, and that will not be easy with a president like Trump, who was surely not 100 percent joking when he said in March of President Xi: âPresident for life. â¦ I think itâs great. Maybe weâll want to give that a shot someday.â

What Really Happens in Chinaâs âRe-educationâ Camps,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2039420198?accountid=14586,"What does it take to intern half a million members of one ethnic group in just a year? Enormous resources and elaborate organization, but the Chinese authorities arenât stingy. Vast swathes of the Uighur population in Chinaâs western region of Xinjiang â as well as Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other ethnic minorities â are being detained to undergo what the state calls âtransformation through education.â Many tens of thousands of them have been locked up in new thought-control camps with barbed wire, bombproof surfaces, reinforced doors and guard rooms.
The Chinese authorities are cagey and evasive, if not downright dismissive, about reports concerning such camps. But now they will have to explain away their own eloquent trail of evidence: an online public bidding system set up by the government inviting tenders from contractors to help build and run the camps.
Uighurs have more in common, culturally and linguistically, with Turks than Han Chinese, and many Uighurs are Muslim. Resentful of Chinaâs heavy-handed rule in the region, some have resisted it, usually through peaceful means, but on occasion violently, by attacking government officials and, exceptionally, civilians. The state, for its part, fuels Islamophobia by labeling ordinary Muslim traditions as the manifestation of religious âextremism.â
Over the last decade, the Xinjiang authorities have accelerated policies to reshape Uighursâ habits â even, the state says, their thoughts. Local governments organize public ceremonies and signings asking ethnic minorities to pledge loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party; they hold mandatory re-education courses and forced dance performances, because some forms of Islam forbid dance. In some neighborhoods, security organs carry out regular assessments of the risk posed by residents: Uighurs get a 10 percent deduction on their score for ethnicity alone and lose another 10 percent if they pray daily.
Uighurs had grown accustomed to living under an intrusive state, but measures became draconian after the arrival in late 2016 of a new regional party chief from Tibet. Since then, some local police officers have said that they struggled to meet their new detention quotas â in the case of one village, 40 percent of the population.
A new study by Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the European School of Culture and Theology, in Korntal, Germany, analyzed government ads inviting tenders for various contracts concerning re-education facilities in more than 40 localities across Xinjiang, offering a glimpse of the vast bureaucratic, human and financial resources the state dedicates to this detention network. The report reveals the stateâs push to build camps in every corner of the region since 2016, at a cost so far of more than 680 million yuan (over $107 million).
A bid invitation appears to have been posted on April 27 â a sign that more camps are being built. These calls for tenders refer to compounds of up to 880,000 square feet, some with quarters for Peopleâs Armed Police, a paramilitary security force. Local governments are also placing ads to recruit camp staff with expertise in criminal psychology or a background in the military or the police force.
Evidence of these technical details is invaluable, especially considering the growing difficulties faced by researchers and reporters trying to work in Xinjiang. Several foreign journalists have produced important articles, despite police harassment and brief arrests; ethnic Uighur reporters, or their families, endure far worse.
Given the risks, firsthand accounts from former detainees remain rare â although a few are starting to emerge.
In February, a Uighur man studying in the United States gave Foreign Policy one of the most detailed descriptions of detention conditions published to date. He was arrested upon returning to China for a visit last year, and then held for 17 days on no known charge. He described long days of marching in a crowded cell, chanting slogans and watching propaganda videos about purportedly illegal religious activities. As he was being released, a guard warned him, âWhatever you say or do in North America, your family is still here and so are we.â
Last month, an ethnic Kazakh man described to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty his four-month stint in a camp in northern Xinjiang. He met inmates serving terms as long as seven years. He said he had been made to study how âto keep safe the domestic secretsâ of China and ânot to be a Muslim.â In these cases, as in many others, detainees were held incommunicado, their families left to wonder what had happened to them.
And now these rare eyewitness accounts are being corroborated, if unwittingly, by the Chinese state itself, as it makes public calls for contracts to build even more detention camps.
Many details of this carceral system are hidden, and remain unknown â in fact, even the campsâ ultimate purpose is not entirely clear.
They serve as grounds for compulsory indoctrination. Some officials use them for prevention as well, to lock down people they presumptively suspect of opposing Chinese rule: In two localities, the authorities have targeted people under 40, claiming that this age group is a âviolent generation.â
The camps are also tools of punishment, and of course, a threat. Few detainees are formally charged, much less sentenced. Some are told how long a term they will serve; others are simply held indefinitely. This uncertainty â the arbitrary logic of detention â instills fear in the entire population.
Surveillance was markedly heightened during my last trip to Xinjiang in December â so much so that I avoided talking to Uighurs then for fear that just being in contact with a foreigner would get them sent away for re-education. Meanwhile, my Uighur contacts outside China were pointing to the quota-based purges of the Communistsâ Anti-Rightist campaign of 1957-59 and ever-shifting rules during the Cultural Revolution to explain that even if Uighurs in Xinjiang today wanted to submit wholly to the security regime, they no longer knew how to. Joining the security services used to be a rare way to ensure oneâs personal safety. Not anymore.
Tens of thousands of families have been torn apart; an entire culture is being criminalized. Some local officials use chilling language to describe the purpose of detention, such as âeradicating tumorsâ or spraying chemicals on crops to kill the âweeds.â
Labeling with a single word the deliberate and large-scale mistreatment of an ethnic group is tricky: Old terms often camouflage the specifics of new injustices. And drawing comparisons between the suffering of different groups is inherently fraught, potentially reductionist. But I would venture this statement to describe the plight of Chinaâs Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz today: Xinjiang has become a police state to rival North Korea, with a formalized racism on the order of South African apartheid.
There is every reason to fear that the situation will only worsen. Several accounts of Uighurs dying in detention have surfaced recently â a worrisome echo of the established use of torture in Chinaâs re-education camps for followers of the spiritual movement Falun Gong. And judging by their camp-building spree in Xinjiang, the Chinese authorities donât seem to think they have come close to achieving whatever their goal there is.

"Chinaâs ZTE, Saved by U.S., Has a Checkered Past and Shaky Future","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2052702917?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â The Chinese electronics maker ZTE has survived its brush with death. Now it has to figure out how to stay in business.
With this weekâs deal to replace near-fatal American sanctions on the telecommunications giant with a $1 billion fine, the company will be able to get back to making smartphones and network equipment. Barred from buying American-made components for the past two months, it halted operations and will now have to mend relations with customers.
It will also need to confront deeper questions about its way of doing business, which has left a trail of accusations of bribery, overbilling and rule-breaking.
âEven with the ban lifted, operators will think twice about bringing them in, no matter what sorts of measures are taken from a transparency or compliance perspective,â said Bengt Nordstrom, chief executive of the telecom consultancy Northstream.
Officials in China made rescuing ZTE a top priority during recent trade talks with Washington. The Trump administration gave the company a second chance in order to help cool tensions with Beijing ahead of a summit meeting next week with North Koreaâs leader.
But the accusations of wrongdoing by ZTE â a previously little-known manufacturer that became an unlikely political football, then an even unlikelier object of sympathy for President Trump â speak to a broader issue for China.
Chinese companies are going global in force, in areas as varied as construction, entertainment and railways. But the countryâs leaders want to foster national champions, brand names known worldwide for quality.
A reputation for flouting the rules, combined with national security fears about high-tech products from China, does not help that effort.
Violations of trade controls on Iran and North Korea were what got ZTE in trouble with the United States Department of Commerce. As part of the deal on Thursday, the company will replace its board and senior leadership. Compliance officers will be installed within the company and will report to Washington. ZTE did not respond to a request for comment.
This was hardly the first time ZTE has faced allegations of questionable business conduct. In Kenya, a contract between ZTE and the local police was canceled in 2013 because of overbilling, a decision the company appealed but failed to overturn. In Algeria, two ZTE executives were convicted of corruption in 2012. At the time, ZTE said it had no comment on the Algerian ruling.
Zambia ended a contract with ZTE in 2013, after finding that an auction had not taken place, leading to suspicions that the projectâs costs had been inflated. In the Philippines, the company was accused in 2007 of bribing officials including the countryâs president at the time. (The corruption case against the president was later dropped because of a lack of evidence.)
In response to these and other cases, Norwayâs sovereign wealth fund, one of the worldâs largest, said in 2016 that it would exclude ZTE from its investments. The fundâs ethics council said there was âan unacceptable risk that ZTE has been involved in gross corruption and that the company may again become involved in similar practices.â
The companyâs record is not unblemished in its home market, either. A local manager for China Mobile, the countryâs largest wireless operator, was found guilty last year of accepting bribes from several companies, including a ZTE subsidiary. ZTE did not comment at the time.
It has other issues in the United States, too. American officials have for years voiced concerns that ZTE equipment may be used by the Chinese government for espionage or network disruption, an allegation also leveled against the firmâs main Chinese rival, Huawei.
As a result, large American mobile companies such as AT&T are effectively barred from buying gear from the two companies, and small American carriers may soon be as well, if a proposed Federal Communications Commission rule goes into effect.
ZTE executives are hoping to move past at least one aspect of their fraught relationship with Washington. On Friday, in a letter to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times, the companyâs chairman, Yin Yimin, apologized for what he called âproblemsâ in the companyâs culture and management.
âOur executives and employees must reflect on this incident, absorb the lessons and earnestly hold ourselves to account to prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again,â wrote Mr. Yin, who took his post last year.
Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment was not always such a problem child for Chinaâs leaders. It started out in 1985 as a joint venture between a state-owned aerospace factory and two other companies. In the 1990s, ZTE joined other Chinese businesses in venturing into the international market. Officials hailed ZTE as an exemplar of a new kind of Chinese company, one that was âstate owned, privately run.â
ZTEâs shares are listed publicly, but its largest shareholder is backed by two state entities, and the Chinese government has long helped and championed the company. In 2012, when ZTE was losing money, the state-backed China Development Bank swooped in with a $20 billion financing agreement.
Today, with the development of the next wave of wireless technology, or 5G, both ZTE and Huawei are playing a major role in shaping global standards and preparing new equipment. ZTEâs ability to be a leading 5G player now looks shaky, however.
âIn 5G, ZTE has successfully pushed themselves to the forefront with primary research and development,â said Chris Lane, a telecom analyst in Hong Kong with Sanford C. Bernstein. âCarriers were considering using them, and thatâs clearly gone now.â
This weekâs deal with Washington is the latest step in the long, tortuous narrative of ZTEâs dealings in Iran.
According to the Commerce Department, the company used American-sourced technology to build and maintain telecom networks there, employing seemingly independent businesses to dodge United States sanctions.
After officials began investigating, ZTE falsely told government agents that it had already stopped shipments to Iran, according to United States authorities. It asked a team of employees to destroy materials related to the Iran business, the agency said. It even made plans to resume shipments to Iran while the investigation was underway, the agency said.
In March 2017, Washington hit the company with $1.19 billion in penalties and ordered it to submit to regular audits.
But in March this year, ZTE told the Commerce Department that it had previously made false statements about what it had done to discipline employees involved in the Iran violations. The agency then ordered that American companies be banned from selling technology to ZTE for seven years.
The pattern of falsehoods, the order said, was âindicative of a company incapable of being, or unwilling to be, a reliable and trustworthy recipient of U.S.-origin goods, software and technology.â Additional financial penalties were âunlikely to lead to the companyâs reform,â the department said.
The financial penalty announced this week â $1 billion plus $400 million held in escrow â sets a record for civil and criminal penalties in a sanctions case, according to the agency.
While mobile carriers in many countries may now be wary of buying from ZTE, that might not be the case in China, where the company makes most of its money.
âChinese carriers will be less sensitive, because they are state enterprises,â said Edison Lee, a telecom analyst at Jefferies in Hong Kong. âThey follow the governmentâs âBuy Chinaâ policy.â
Still, he said, âIâm not sure the Chinese government can help them again if they donât behave.â
This week, the website of China Radio International, a state broadcaster, published an opinion piece on ZTE that said Chinese companies should not be âgiant babiesâ that relied on Beijing to get them out of tough spots.
âMore and more Chinese companies have gone overseas in recent years, but once they are abroad, the key is to take it upon themselves to fully understand international standards and laws,â the article says. âPowerful as the motherland may be, companies still need to handle their own issues.â

"As China Curbs Borrowing, Growth Shows Signs of Faltering","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://sear ch.proquest.com/docview/2055678406?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI â Chinaâs government has been trying to break the countryâs addiction to ever-rising debt, but its effort to crack down on easy money is starting to hit growth in the worldâs second-biggest economy.
Beijing has been concerned in recent years about the increased reliance on credit to keep the economy expanding briskly, worrying that it could lead to a financial crisis, or to a long period of stagnation like the one in Japan after the real estate market burst in the early 1990s.
But curbing debt may have significant consequences in China and elsewhere. Countries around the world are much more closely tied to China than ever before, because of its role not just as the worldâs biggest manufacturer by far but also, increasingly, as a consumer. An economic slowdown in China â coupled with the knock-on effects of widening trade disputes and slowing growth in Europe â may augur poorly for a global economy that even recently seemed in rude health.
Domestically, Chinaâs credit crackdown has affected smaller businesses hardest. Though the country often appears to be dominated by its vast conglomerates and hulking state-owned enterprises, its economy is, in reality, somewhat more reliant on small businesses than its Western counterparts. And the way Beijing has gone about curbing lending in recent months is unintentionally hitting the most entrepreneurial segments of the economy, the governor of Chinaâs central bank acknowledged in a speech on Thursday in Shanghai.
Over all, there is growing evidence that a credit crunch is taking a toll on the Chinese economy.
The National Bureau of Statistics released data in Beijing on Thursday showing that investment, retail sales and industrial production all slowed in May. The slowdowns in investment and retail sales were particularly sharp and unexpected.
With that backdrop of eroding economic growth, the Peopleâs Bank of China, the countryâs central bank, conspicuously did not match on Thursday the Federal Reserveâs increase to interest rates on Wednesday. It had at least partly matched previous Federal Reserve interest rate rises since the autumn.
An index of 300 large-company stocks traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped 0.4 percent on Thursday, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.9 percent on the poor economic news from the mainland.
With the Chinese economy showing signs of slowing and the authorities making it harder to borrow, small businesses are particularly vulnerable. They represent about three-fifths of economic output in China, compared with around half in Germany, Japan and the United States, according to Yi Gang, the governor of the Peopleâs Bank of China.
Now many of those small businesses are struggling for loans because of a wide-ranging government crackdown. Moodyâs and Standard & Poorâs both downgraded Chinaâs sovereign debt credit rating last year because of concerns about the countryâs debt overhang.
The downgrades were among many reasons the government has tightened some curbs on borrowing since the end of the autumn. Beijing has particularly clamped down on lending by online finance companies and other private sector businesses that bypass the state-controlled banking system.
While commercial banks have continued to lend the money they hold from deposits, these conventional loans go mainly to state-owned enterprises. Private lenders, meanwhile, charge interest rates that are double or triple the 6 percent charged by banks, but they are often the only source of financing for small businesses.
Despite the higher interest rates, âwe should also fully affirm the significance of private loans, which are an important supplementâ to bank lending in the Chinese economy, said Mr. Yi, speaking at the Lujiazui Forum, a gathering in Shanghai of Chinaâs top financial regulators. The forum, held at the start of each summer, is one of the Chinese governmentâs main channels for signaling the direction of Chinese monetary and financial policy.
Even before deciding on Thursday morning not to match the Fedâs rate increase, though, the Chinese government had already made a pair of moves that appear to have been elaborately crafted to channel more money to smaller, more entrepreneurial businesses.
At the start of this month, the central bank said that commercial banks could use some of their small-business loans as collateral for borrowing money at low interest rates directly from the central bank. And on April 17, it told commercial banks that they could reduce the amount of money they set aside unprofitably as reserves, provided that they took actions that would leave them with more cash to lend to small and midsize businesses.
Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a Shanghai-based research group, said on the sidelines of the Lujiazui Forum that Chinaâs private-sector companies of all sizes, even large ones, had long faced challenges in obtaining loans. But the credit squeeze on them this spring has been particularly painful.
âItâs very bad, and we see not just small and medium-sized enterprises defaulting but even big companies defaulting,â he said.
Some financial regulators nevertheless appear determined to maintain the crackdown on informal lending.
Speaking at the forum, Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, called for further rigor. He warned the audience against putting money into the dwindling number of online finance companies that still offered high returns on investment. While some informal lending operations provide valuable credit to small businesses, others have proved to be fraudulent.
âYou need to report them so we can find all these Ponzi-type schemes,â Mr. Guo said.
Chinaâs financial policymakers have made clear that they do not mind seeing a few defaults and some strains in the system. Retail auto sales slackened last month, and unsold cars have started accumulating at dealerships. A decision by the authorities to allow at least a dozen bond defaults in recent weeks, after years of preventing them, has rattled some investors.
The Chinese economy is not crashing. By international standards, the pace of bond defaults is still negligible. While car sales have leveled off, they have done so at a very high level after two decades of strong growth, causing chronic traffic jams. Real estate demand is still buoyant, and so is the construction industry.
But faced with a high level of debt across the economy, âwhat regulators need to be careful is not to respond in such a heavy-handed way that it could essentially compound the risks,â said Fred Hu, an influential Chinese economist who is now a hedge fund chairman in Hong Kong.

"Exiled in the U.S., a Lawyer Warns of âChinaâs Long Armâ","The New York Times, International edition; New Yor k",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2056227470?accountid=14586,"From his suburban home in New Jersey, Teng Biao has watched in frustration as what he sees as the apologies to China from Western companies have come fast and furious this year.
First, there was the hotel chain Marriott International, which apologized to the Chinese government in January for having sent out a customer survey listing Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and the self-governing island of Taiwan as separate territories, a violation of the Communist Party canon that raised the ire of some Chinese citizens.
Then there was Gap Inc., which posted a message to the Chinese apologizing for a T-shirt with a map of China that ignited similar criticism. And in May, Air Canada on its website began listing Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, as a part of Communist-ruled China, which the Taiwanese reject.
For Mr. Teng, one of Chinaâs pre-eminent civil rights lawyers, it all amounted to craven behavior from Western companies trying to stay in the good graces of Chinese officials and citizens to maintain access to the enormous consumer market in China.
âFor the past two or three years, Iâve been paying attention to self-censorship by Western scholars, institutions and companies,â Mr. Teng, 44, said one recent afternoon in a cafe in Midtown Manhattan. âItâs urgent. Chinaâs rising threat to international freedom and democracy has become a hot topic.â
Officials and political analysts in Western nations have indeed spoken up in the past year about what they call Chinaâs âinfluence operationsâ or âsharp power,â how it coerces foreigners to bend to its point of view, or to self-censor in return for favors or access to the Chinese market.
Since 2013, Mr. Teng has spoken about these concerns four times to groups in the United States Congress and he has given lectures on university campuses on the same topic. He said he plans to write a book on it.
âI felt itâs high time to change the Westâs policy toward China,â he said.
Mr. Teng has embraced this new role partly out of necessity. Under increasing harassment by the Chinese authorities, he left China in 2012 to spend time in Hong Kong and the United States. He does not dare return because of an official crackdown in recent years on rights lawyers that has landed many of his friends in prison. He now lives with his wife, Lynn Wang, and two daughters, ages 10 and 12, in West Windsor, N.J.
Mr. Tengâs interest in putting the spotlight on what he calls âChinaâs long armâ comes from personal experience. In 2016, he clashed publicly with the American Bar Association over its decision to rescind an offer to publish a book by Mr. Teng on the history of the lawyer-led rights movement in China. Mr. Teng said the group did this because it did not want to jeopardize its operations in Beijing. The Bar Association denied his accusation, saying the offer was withdrawn for economic reasons.
âThe cross-border repression of which Teng Biao himself has become a victim has become this whole new complex set of issues,â said Eva Pils, a scholar at Kingâs College London, who once directed a center at the Chinese University of Hong Kong that hosted Mr. Teng. âIâm wary of how repression crosses borders, and Iâm wary of how China is changing norms.â
Mr. Teng and his family also ran into financial difficulties in the United States after his wife was dismissed from her job as an international representative for a Chinese technology parts company â a move that he said had been forced by Chinese officials. His wife had worked for the company for 17 years.
âThe Chinese government put pressure on that company,â Mr. Teng said. âThe company said that because of me, they couldnât sell their products to Chinese agencies and the military.â
Mr. Teng grew up in a village in the northeastern province of Jilin. His father was a painter and held a low-level official post related to education and culture, while his mother worked as a farmer. He received a slot at prestigious Peking University and decided to study law, eventually earning a doctorate in law in 2002.
While teaching at the China University of Political Science and Law, he became involved in the case of Sun Zhigang, a migrant worker killed by the police while in detention in the south. This started Mr. Teng and other lawyers on the road to activism, leading to their harassment by officials.
Mr. Teng and his wife watched with growing anxiety as President Xi Jinping tightened control over civil society after taking power in 2012. Mr. Teng already had been detained repeatedly and beaten by police officers, with his family illegally kept in the dark as to his whereabouts for weeks at a stretch.
He went to the Chinese University of Hong Kong as a visiting scholar in 2012, then flew to the United States with his younger daughter two years later after getting an invitation from Harvard. By then, his wife and elder daughter had been barred from leaving the mainland, but they fled through Southeast Asia in 2015 with the help of smugglers, at one point riding on the backs of motorbikes through the hills of Thailand.
After Harvard, Mr. Teng was able to establish affiliations with New York University and Princeton Universityâs Institute for Advanced Study.
At Princeton in 2017, he collaborated with two other liberal Chinese to found a nonprofit group that aims to promote democracy in China by holding local gatherings, publishing books in Chinese and running online courses. Mr. Teng said the site for those courses is largely blocked in China.
Mr. Teng helped organize a march in Washington last July to call attention to Chinaâs crackdown on rights lawyers, which officials began in earnest on July 9, 2015. About 50 people took part in the march, and Mr. Teng plans to hold another one next month.
This April, Mr. Teng wrote an essay for ChinaFile, a website run by the Asia Society in New York, arguing that âXi Jinpingâs new totalitarianism and Maoâs old style of totalitarianism donât differ by all that much.â
âI think there must be some leaders, even top leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, who have ideas of liberal democracy,â he said in the interview. âBut they donât promote democracy. The first thing is theyâre too scared. The second thing is they donât want to lose the benefits they get from the system.â
One afternoon in March 2017, at a student-organized gathering at Princeton, Mr. Teng debated Chinaâs future with Sida Liu, a professor from the University of Toronto who was also a visiting scholar at Princeton that academic year. Mr. Teng took a harsh view of the party, saying it would never change, while Mr. Liu was more circumspect.
In an interview this week, Mr. Liu said exiles like Mr. Teng have had to take a new approach to activism because of the crackdowns under Mr. Xi and the constant detentions.
âWhen I was in Princeton, Teng Biao was busy helping victims and families of the crackdown get out of China â to flee rather than to put in resources into China or support the next waves of activists,â Mr. Liu said.
Mr. Teng has warned that some Chinese nationals in the United States try to monitor the dissenters in exile and report back to Chinese officials. He pointed to the 150 or so campus chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, where some members maintain contact with Chinese diplomats and try to quash talks at universities that clash with the official Chinese view.
Ms. Pils said while it was important to look at these influence operations, Westerners need to be careful about assumptions they make about Chinese living abroad.
âI think it is absolutely undeniable there is a problem, and we must study it,â she said. âBut thereâs a risk of returning to Cold War ideas. Itâs important to be clear about the dangers of that. One risk obviously is that we end up replicating what the Chinese government says about people from the West â that theyâre subversive and that theyâre here to undermine the system.â

"Marching Across China, Army Veterans Join Ranks of Protesters","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2059662593?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â They converge from across China, marching in the hundreds, ungainly from lack of training but proudly waving red national flags and wearing green uniforms recalling years of military service. Then they line up in front of government buildings.
But they come to protest, not protect, the officials sheltered inside.
They are the latest discontented group to upset the Chinese Communist Partyâs image of imperturbable dominance: Peopleâs Liberation Army veterans who have held protests across several cities in recent weeks over what they say is mistreatment, poor job prospects and inadequate benefits.
[Video: Footage said to be of veterans protesting in Zhenjiang, China. Watch on YouTube.]
The latest erupted last week in Zhenjiang, a city in Jiangsu Province in eastern China. Hundreds of former soldiers â some online accounts claimed thousands â rushed there after rumors spread that at least one veteran had been beaten while seeking government help. The precise course of events is unclear, but for many protesters, the episode crystallized their broader anger with officialdom.
âThe problem is that thereâs too much corruption at the local level,â Chen Wuliang, a former soldier from eastern China who said he had gone to Zhenjiang, said by telephone. âWhere the local corruption is bad is also where old veterans who fought in wars are worst oppressed.â
The recent burst of veteran-led protests does not present a dire threat to Communist Party rule, which remains broadly popular and backed by a daunting police apparatus. On Monday, the protests in Zhenjiang appeared to have dispersed.
But the demonstrations show how even under the sweeping dominance of President Xi Jinping discontent persists, taking forms that can catch the government by surprise. The veterans, coming from across the country and with tight bonds formed in military service, are a particularly stubborn headache.
âWeâre comrades in arms and all keep in touch,â Mr. Chen said. âGenerally, itâs through WeChat and sometimes the phone,â he said, referring to a vastly popular social media service.
Other Chinese cities have been struck by similar protests in recent months. In late May, many hundreds of veterans gathered for days in Luohe, a city in central China, after accounts spread that a former soldierâs wife had been detained by the police after she joined veterans who had gone to Beijing to demand better treatment.
[Video: Protesters, said to be military veterans, lined up in a show of solidarity in Luohe, central China. Watch on YouTube.]
In mid-June, veterans protested in Zhongjiang County, in southern China, after rumors spread that a disabled former soldier there had been beaten by the police. Websites dedicated to human rights issues in China record many more smaller assemblies by aggrieved veterans, often after they lose jobs or fail to win improved benefits.
Party leaders in Beijing were shocked in 2016 and early 2017 when about a thousand veterans twice entered the capital and sat in protest â the first time outside the Peopleâs Liberation Army headquarters, and the second outside the partyâs anticorruption agency.
Despite censors, Chinese internet chat rooms for veterans are still lively with talk of the various protests. After the latest one, a message warned that former soldiers were honing their skills in confrontation, just as they had once drilled on parade grounds.
âNo matter whether itâs political brains, strategy and tactics, objectives and orientation, organizational means or operational efficiency, itâs all been very much like a successful war of encirclement,â a message said on a website for Chinese veterans. âThe self-organized ârights self-defenseâ by us ex-service personnel seems to have secured another victory.â
Demonstrations and petitions by aggrieved former service personnel go back many decades in China. In the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping retrenched one million troops, and from the 1990s, many found it hard to find secure work as market reforms eroded guaranteed government job assignments .
But the sizable protests this year are still striking because Mr. Xi has often praised Chinese soldiers, promised better treatment for veterans and this year established a Ministry of Veterans Affairs intended to end bureaucratic buck-passing over their needs.
âThe ministry should provide better service and protect the legal rights and interests of veterans so that military service can be one of the most dignified careers,â Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said when the ministry began operations in April.
Despite such steps, many former soldiers feel a gulf between the rhetorical laurels from the government and the practical problems they face. The new ministry has already become a destination for veterans who feel that local officials have ignored their grievances.
[Video: Protesters in Zhongjiang. Watch on YouTube.]
Many veterans seem âhighly skeptical that the establishment of a new ministry will matter much, and interpret it as a symbolic concession,â Neil J. Diamant, a professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania who studies protests by Chinese veterans, said by email.
âA new ministry gives veterans an address, but no more power,â he said. âThey remain supplicants for state largess â and this is exactly how the government wants it to remain.â
China has more serving military personnel than any other country, and by official estimate it has 57 million veterans, most of them recruited from villages and towns for a few yearsâ service. That makes for a large pool of potential discontent.
Often, protesting veterans are unhappy that they have been shunted into low-end work or lost their jobs in cutbacks. Other sources of complaint are poor medical care, and pensions and stipends smaller than they believe is their due. Many veterans, using a Chinese saying, liken themselves to donkeys slaughtered after they are too old to work a grindstone.
âThe government increasingly proclaims its having âarrivedâ in the rank of top nations,â Professor Diamant said. âVeterans have noticed this. Naturally, they wonder why should they struggle for medicine and pensions when the government they served is now rich.â
Not all the veterans contacted for this article supported the demonstrations or said that their living conditions were stagnant. Some said that more spending by local governments in recent years had helped. Those who spoke on the record did not want their precise whereabouts described.
âOur treatment here has improved,â said Gao Xiangxu, a veteran who lives in a northern Chinese city. âIâm not sure about other places.â
But apart from strained living conditions, discontented veterans said that they had not been afforded the dignity they expected from society after years of poorly paid service, and sometimes sacrifice in wars. Quite a number say they fought in Chinaâs war against Vietnam in 1979, when the Peopleâs Liberation Army forces declared victory but suffered ignominious setbacks.
âWhen we old soldiers were young and went to the front line, we were answering the call of the country and the party to fight Vietnam,â said Zheng Huizu, a veteran from eastern China. He said that he had wanted to protest in Zhenjiang but that local officials had stopped him.
âIf we old soldiers hadnât gone to fight against Vietnam, how could things have gone smoothly for our country?â he said by telephone. âWithout heroes to fight a battle, how can a country be at peace?â
Under Mr. Xi, the Chinese police and security forces have already clamped down on protests and dissent, especially by liberal opponents of the party. Clamping down on veterans presents more delicate complications. They often declare their loyalty to the party and carry pictures of Mao and Mr. Xi as proof.
The government appears likely to tighten surveillance and perhaps offer concessions to veterans in an effort to douse protests. But some former soldiers warned that they would wait only so long to see if the new Ministry of Veteran Affairs improved their lives.
âIf the ministry is just decoration, the same old medicine in a different broth,â a message on a veteransâ internet chat room this month said, âthen no number of iron stallions of stability preservation will be able to stop the great army of rights defense.â

"As Trade Fight Looms, China Turns Censors on Its Own Policies","The New York Times, Internati onal edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2061012973?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI â Chinaâs government, which tirelessly suppresses critical voices, unwanted ideologies and subversive memes, has turned its censors against an unlikely target: its own economic policies.
As Washington and Beijing spar over trade, news outlets here have been ordered not to mention Made in China 2025, an industrial master plan that aims to turn the country into a high-tech superpower, according to two people at Chinese news organizations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the censorship authoritiesâ secretive workings.
The Trump administration has repeatedly singled out the campaign to show that Beijing is using unfair means to acquire cutting-edge American technology. Despite months of talks, the two countries remain at an impasse.
The White House is moving ahead with tariffs on China, and Beijing has refused to back down, raising the specter of a full-blown trade war between the worldâs two biggest economies. Over all, the Trump administration has threatened penalties on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, nearly equivalent to the total value of goods imported into the United States from China last year.
All the scrutiny may be making Chinaâs leaders nervous.
In an apparent attempt to avoid drawing more attention to the Made in China 2025 campaign, news media have been told simply not to mention it. It is not clear how broadly the orders were issued across Chinese media outlets. The instructions were reported earlier by Reuters.
News organizations in China have little choice but to comply with such directives, which can include both targeted orders to remove specific articles as well as guidance, often delivered over the phone, about the tone and content of coverage. Articles critical of the government are deleted outright, even at influential outlets such as Caixin Media. Censors regularly take down images and posts from social media as well.
Even before the latest orders, however, the media coverage in China of the recent economic tensions with the United States has been largely free of nationalistic or inflammatory language. Absent official guidance against covering certain issues, Chinese media organizations often self-censor, wary of drawing the ire of authorities.
Made in China 2025 is not being scrubbed from the Chinese internet entirely. A speech mentioning the plan was published on a high-level government agencyâs website on Monday. L ocal government websites have continued to refer to it.
More important, t here is no indication that Beijing is preparing to compromise on the policies, such as financial support for local players and assistance in buying overseas competitors, that undergird the modernization plan.
But Chinaâs leaders might not want the domestic media to whip up excessive public outrage, lest it constrain their ability to negotiate with Washington.
âThese days, restrictions on information by the Chinese Communist Party are predominantly strategic and contextual, and not ideological or necessarily about judgments of the intrinsic sensitivity of a story or topic,â said David Bandurski, who is a co-director of the China Media Project, a research program in Hong Kong, and a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin.
âThat means just about any story, fact or image can instantly become sensitive given the right extrinsic factors, like too much online attention and speculation,â Mr. Bandurski said.
Western companies have long protested Chinese policies that privilege local firms over foreign ones. Made in China 2025 has drawn particular attention, though.
The campaign was first announced in 2015. But a year later, reports by American and European business groups highlighted unfair advantages Chinese companies could gain in overseas markets, and the initiative began to receive wider attention in the West.
At the time, the Chinese government seemed eager to play down certain controversial aspects of the plan, such as targets for domestic firmsâ share of the Chinese market in specific industries.
Lance Noble, a senior analyst in Beijing at the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, said that in 2016, when foreign business groups raised concerns about a technical road map for carrying out the plan, Chinese officials responded by saying that it was âjust a think tank exercise,â with no formal standing in policy.
Beijing has used state media to try to hit back at criticism of the campaign, too.
Just last week, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China released a survey in which many respondents said they had seen âincreased discriminationâ in the country as a result of Made in China 2025.
In response, Global Times, a state-run tabloid known for its nationalistic bent, published an article arguing that the survey results reflected a misunderstanding of the plan.

Mao 101: Inside a Chinese Classroom Training the Communists of Tomorrow,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2063818018?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Democracy. Is it effective or flawed? Would it work in China?
Debate.
Those were the teacherâs instructions on a recent Sunday morning when 17 college students met at Tsinghua University in Beijing for âMao Zedong Thought and the Theoretical System of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,â a mouthful of a course that is part of a government-mandated regimen of ideological education in China.
The students were sporting dragon tattoos and irreverent shirts â one had âObsessive Compulsive Disorderâ emblazoned on its back â and playing bloody shoot-âem-up video games on their phones before class.
But inside classroom 106-B, they echoed the party line.
âWeâve learned democracy just canât last long here,â said Zhang Tingkai, a 19-year-old architecture major, describing the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution under Mao.
âIt can easily turn into populism,â said Mao Quanwu, 20, a mechanical engineering student, âlike whatâs happening in Taiwan.â
The uniformity of opinion would likely have pleased Communist Party leaders, who often rail against the dangers of Western-style liberalism. But the challenges facing the party as it seeks to inspire a new generation of Communists are clear.
While students publicly praise ideological classes like this one, in private many say they find the courses dull and irrelevant, numbing propaganda â and only grudgingly participate.
At one lecture, students watched historical dramas and scanned social media sites on their laptops while a professor spoke about the importance of studying Maoâs ideology. At another session, they chatted with friends and worked on physics problems.
The courses, some of which have existed for decades, are more important than ever to President Xi Jinping and the party.
While the emphasis on Mao evokes turbulent periods of Chinese history, many in China still see Mao as a hero. Elements of his philosophy, like suspicion of foreign ideas and calls for centralized power, help lend legitimacy to Mr. Xiâs agenda.
So under pressure from Mr. Xi, Chinaâs most powerful leader in decades, professors are working to make ideological classes more relevant to the lives of students, infusing lectures with humor and references to popular culture.
âWe are making the theories interesting again,â Feng Wuzhong, the head teacher of the Mao Zedong Thought course, said one day after class.
While primary and secondary schools have had success with patriotic education, by the time students reach college, they are often more critical, worldly and defiant. The notion of a forced curriculum runs counter to ideals of academic freedom many students admire.
In the Beijing classroom, students could recite major points from lectures when put on the spot by Xi Liuchang, the graduate student overseeing the discussion section.
Some questions about the finer points of Maoâs theories were met with long silences. Some students openly acknowledged they hadnât prepared.
Within the Communist Party, there are deep anxieties about the âideological purityâ of this generation of university students, who have only a faint connection, through parents and grandparents, to the Mao era and the ideals of revolution. The state-run media has described them as too cynical, independent and apathetic about politics.
Under Mr. Xi, officials have prescribed a heavier dose of ideological education across Chinaâs more than 2,500 universities.
Students must now complete up to five courses to graduate â including a class on Marxism, one on morality, a modern Chinese history course, and âsituation and policy education,â an exploration of modern-day issues like the territorial dispute in the South China Sea and policies concerning ethnic minorities.
Mr. Xiâs administration has chastised universities, including Tsinghua, his alma mater, as too lax, and the government has dispatched inspectors to discourage criticism of the Communist Party on campus.
At the same time, officials have urged professors to rethink how they teach ideology, warning that students are not willing to listen to âdead theories.â Some colleges are beginning to offer lessons on Mr. Xiâs own worldview, known as Xi Jinping Thought.
Professor Feng is helping lead the push for change. In 2015, he began offering classes on Maoism on edX, the online platform founded by Harvard and M.I.T., one of the first Chinese professors to embrace the internet to teach ideology courses.
Mr. Feng, an energetic orator who sometimes dresses in Mao suits, now teaches Mao Zedong Thought primarily through online lecture videos on topics like âThe Necessity of the Sinicization of Marxismâ and âThe Living Soul of Mao Zedong Thought.â
He assigns readings not just by Mao but by Western authors like Alexis de Tocqueville and Samuel P. Huntington, the American political scientist.
During live lectures, he tries to bring the material to life by discussing topics like Maoâs favorite books and asking students to rate the policies of Chinese leaders, rewarding the most active participants with digital cash sent by WeChat, the messaging app.
Still, Mr. Fengâs lectures can have the feel of a different era. In describing Maoâs views on revolution, for example, he rails against imperialist forces and âbureaucratic capitalismâ for âruthlessly exploiting laboring people.â
Those sentiments are jarring in modern-day China, where capitalism is now openly embraced, fueling a sense that ideological courses are no longer pertinent.
But Mr. Feng said Maoâs words were more relevant than ever, even if China has changed.
For example, he said, students might see Maoâs call for âarmed struggleâ during the Communist Revolution of 1949 as a reminder of the importance of standing strong in the face of difficulties in daily life.
âStudents should have the courage to confront the tough with toughness,â Mr. Feng said. âThey should dare to crack the hard nut.â
At a recent lecture, he asked students, âIf you were on a deserted island, what book would you bring?â The responses included Chinese classics like âDream of the Red Chamber.â One person, perhaps angling for a better grade, suggested the course textbook for Mao Zedong Thought.
In the Beijing classroom, the discussion turned away from Maoâs theories and to questions about whether Chinaâs authoritarian system offered enough channels for people to express their views.
âOur lives and democracy are disconnected,â said one student, Xiong Yining. âWhen decisions are made by the upper class, we feel that we are not engaged in the process.â
Mr. Zhang, the architecture student, agreed. âWe still donât know why the upper class makes certain decisions,â he said. âThey could be very thoughtful decisions, but if we donât understand why, we might be misled.â
A student asked whether China risked creating another personality cult, but the discussion quickly returned to the strengths of Chinaâs system.
âOur top leader, Xi Jinping has a great deal of prestige,â said Mr. Mao, the mechanical engineering student. âAs long as his decisions are sensible enough, it feels like the risks arenât that big.â
Outside a classroom window, a large red propaganda banner hanging from the side of a building displayed one of Mr. Xiâs favorite phrases, a reminder of the partyâs mission and omnipresence.
âWork hard to achieve the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era,â it said.

Was This Powerful Chinese Empress a Feminist Trailblazer?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2067978647?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â She entered the world of an ancient empire as a teenage concubine, chosen by the emperor to share his bed for her good looks, immaculate comportment and, above all, her ability to sing.
The male-dominated court was a swirl of intrigue, forced suicides and poisonings. Eunuchs assigned to the emperor prepared her for sex with the ruler, undressing her and carrying her to his bed. After the Emperor Xianfengâs death, she governed in the name of young male heirs â from behind a screen.
Perhaps as an escape from these oppressive restrictions, Empress Dowager Cixi (pronounced TSIH-shee), the de facto ruler of China in the final decades of the imperial dynasty, rebuilt a fantastic wonderland, the Summer Palace. Itâs an extended estate of glittery lakes, luxurious gardens and elaborate wooden pavilions on the edge of the nationâs capital, attracting up to 100,000 visitors a day.
Most of them are curious Chinese from across the country who read in their Communist Party-authorized school books that Cixi was a harridan who stole the nationâs wealth and was responsible for Chinaâs humiliating defeat by the Japanese in 1895.
But was she? Cixi, a peer of Queen Victoriaâs and apparently iron-willed, has invited revisionist interpretations that view her as a feminist, at least in the context of the late 19th century, when women in China were treated little better than spittoons.
Strong women in China are often portrayed as power-hungry, and sometimes irrational, and are notably absent from the highest ranks of government. There is no Hillary Clinton figure in contemporary China (the real Mrs. Clinton is vilified by the government for talking about human rights in the country), or an Angela Merkel, who has stood up to China on trade.
When Bo Xilai, a rival to the current ruler, Xi Jinping, was put on trial for corruption, he described his wife as âinsaneâ in an effort to lessen his sentence.
So harking back to the pre-communist era for a feminist trailblazer makes sense. And to search for feminist ideals in a woman who ruled for nearly 50 years, from 1861 until her death in 1908, is understandable.
But the case of Cixi â who was isolated, undereducated and never made a break for personal freedom â is a hard argument to make.
A Chinese historian, Jung Chang, began the re-evaluation of Cixi with her biography, âEmpress Dowager Cixi.â Ms. Chang, who lives in exile, argues the empress brought medieval China into the modern age, calling her an âamazing stateswoman.â
But Ms. Changâs damn-the-man portrait of Cixi is a tad too generous even for some sympathizers. How could the empress dowager have ushered in groundbreaking innovation when much of her career was devoted to her drive to preserve the imperial family that crumbled three years after her death?
And Cixi did undermine a bold reform program begun by her adopted son, Emperor Guangxu, who favored a constitutional monarchy, not an absolute one. She then supported the Boxer rebellion, an anti-foreign, anti-Christian uprising that cost China dearly, a move she later blamed on her bossy male advisers.
A Chinese scholar, Zhang Hongjie, recently took up the cause of the empress in a sympathetic essay, âWoman Cixi,â featured in an anthology about Chinese women and men who have struggled against the odds.
He argued that she was held back by her lack of education, a given at the time because she was a woman, and that she should be given credit for trying to make amends for her mistakes at the end of her rule. But Mr. Zhang said his positive portrait made little impact.
âCixi is still a negative character,â he said.
Her endeavors to preserve the imperial family above all else make for comparisons with Michael Corleone, the fictional Mafia boss.
âShe had one of the most ruthless, savvy political minds, she was like a gangster,â said Jeremiah Jenne, a historian who leads visitors on walking tours around the Summer Palace, where he points out 500-year-old juniper and cypress trees, and paint-faded pavilions like the Hall of Dispelling Clouds, which was renovated in 1895 for her 60th birthday extravaganza.
Cixi had the Summer Palace rebuilt after an invading European army looted and burned the original, which, with its jewel-encrusted furniture and over-the-top silks, was said to be on par with Versailles.
Her reconstruction was not quite as opulent, but it was a sumptuous personal pleasure ground, intended to signify the strength of the family and its immense retinue of courtiers.
Despite the scholarly ruminations about Cixi, many Chinese tourists seem more interested in her extravagant lifestyle and come to see what is left of the loot, much faded because of neglect by the Communist Partyâs cultural administrators.
A favorite is the âmarble boat,â officially known as the Boat of Purity and Ease, a two-story wooden pavilion with wide verandas built into the side of the lakeshore and painted to resemble pale marble.
The official school curriculum says Cixi stole funds from the imperial navy to renovate the boat just two years before the outbreak of war with the Japanese. Because of her thievery, the textbooks say, China lost the naval battles against Japan in 1894.
Crowds, shoulder-to-shoulder on a recent spring day, pressed against the lakeside rail, taking selfies framed by the newly green willow trees that dipped into the water.
âShe had an expensive lifestyle, and China had one disaster after another,â said a middle-aged primary-school teacher, who identified herself as Ms. Ye. She said she had no sympathy for Cixi.
âWhen you are backward as China was then, people will take advantage of you,â she said.
In the gift shops, there are no images of Cixi, just a few pieces of pink silk emblazoned with her calligraphy, sold as wall hangings. Commemorative coins with the portrait of Mao Zedong, cheap bangles, tea sets and hand fans do a brisker trade.
âNo one likes her,â one of the young saleswomen said. âIn history she is bad. Who would buy souvenirs of Cixi?â
Young Chinese tourists showed more sympathy.
âAs a woman, she couldnât make decisions in politics like the men,â said Xiao Yangchuan, 18, a first-year university student. âI think we should see her as a real person. She has her own flaws, and we should understand her era,â she said.
In the last decade of her life, the empress dowager tried to polish her image by making herself more accessible, especially to Western diplomats. But in the end, she could barely overcome the impression that, like many royals in the West, she was most interested in her dogs, gardening and fancy clothing, wrote Sterling Seagrave in his empathetic biography, âDragon Lady.â
Pictures of her are banished to a pavilion near the exit of the palace grounds, where a large sepia photo shows her, surrounded by ladies in waiting, dressed in an embroidered gown with pearls said to be the size of canary eggs, and long, talon-like fingernails.
The day before she died, the young emperor, Guangxu, was found dead â of natural causes, imperial records show. In 2008, Chinese medical investigators found extraordinarily high levels of arsenic in his remains, leading to a popular conclusion that the empress had killed him to try to stop him from introducing political reforms after her own death.
Did she do it? âI am going with Cixi,â said Mr. Jenne, the historian.
In her final years, she was known as the âold Buddha,â a term that friendly biographers say was a term of endearment. Others see it as an appropriately scornful term for a woman who was barely literate, left little for other women to emulate and led the bankrupt Qing dynasty to its downfall in a country whose government remains as male-dominated as ever.

"China Seeks Influence in Europe, One Business Deal at a Time","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2088044696?accountid=14586,"PRAGUE â When Xi Jinping became the first top Chinese leader to visit the Czech Republic, he was accompanied by a mysterious Chinese tycoon with big political ambitions, money to burn and strong ties to the Czech president.
Ye Jianming was the sole businessman among the group of Chinese and Czech government officials who gathered two years ago outside the presidential summer residence where Mr. Xi and Milos Zeman, his Czech counterpart, planted ginkgo trees. For Mr. Ye, it was recognition of his role as a major power broker in Prague, having bought landmark properties, a local brewery and a much beloved soccer team.
The meeting â and the presence of Mr. Ye â cemented Chinaâs newfound influence on politics and business in Mr. Zemanâs Czech Republic and signaled its broader ambitions in Europe.
In just two years Mr. Yeâs company, CEFC China Energy, had spent more than $1 billion on deals in the Czech Republic. He hired former Czech officials, including a onetime defense minister. Mr. Ye was even named a special economic adviser to Mr. Zeman.
Mr. Zeman, in turn, became a big backer of Beijing, tamping down domestic opposition to Chinese influence and taking up Chinese causes. He publicly supported Chinaâs claims over Taiwan, the democratic island that Beijing claims as its territory. When Mr. Xi visited, police tried to keep protesters out of sight; some later accused the police of using violence to suppress them. The family of a prominent Holocaust survivor said Mr. Zeman withdrew a proposed medal for the man after his nephew met with the Dalai Lama, an exiled spiritual leader whom China considers a rebel.
For China, the Czech courtship was an unqualified victory: It had won a sure friend in Europe, an American military ally and a country once seen as a bulwark for liberal democracy in a strategically important region. As Mr. Zeman declared, the Czech Republic hoped to become âan unsinkable aircraft carrier of Chinese investment expansionâ in Europe.
Then, Mr. Ye was detained in China this year, exposing the Czech Republic to the perils of this new relationship and forcing the president to defend his quick embrace of the Chinese deal maker. While the reason for Mr. Yeâs detention was never made public, critics of the Czech president saw Mr. Yeâs disappearance as proof that the country shouldnât have tied its future and its fortune to the Chinese.
An emboldened, globally ambitious China is using money, business deals and other incentives to extend its power abroad. The pitch can hold great appeal in a world shaken by Washingtonâs growing disengagement and Europeâs struggles.
But tighter ties to China mean greater susceptibility to an opaque political system where decisions are made behind the scenes. Investments can be driven by politics rather than economics, resulting in costly white elephants.
In the Czech Republic, Mr. Yeâs sudden disappearance took the countryâs leaders by surprise. They couldnât discern why that would happen to someone who seemed to have the governmentâs blessing. They had not pressed him on where he was getting his money to make big flashy deals in the Czech Republic and elsewhere. Officials also had difficulty answering questions about criminal allegations in the United States that a senior business associate of CEFC had tried to bribe his way into new business opportunities in Africa.
Mr. Zeman dispatched a team of officials to determine what the tycoonâs problems meant for the Czech Republic. He soon found out.
Prague was about to become even more enmeshed with the Chinese government. A state-owned company stepped in to take control of Mr. Yeâs empire, fueling suspicions that the company was politically important to the Chinese leadership.
Eastern Appeal
Early in his political career, Mr. Zeman, a blunt-spoken populist, warned against toadying up to Russia and China. Those seeking deeper ties with Beijing, he told a local newspaper in 1996, are âready to go under plastic surgery to slant their eyes.â
But the realities in Europe were changing by the time he won the Czech presidency in 2013.
The global financial crisis had tested Europeâs unity. Refugees from Syria had begun to arrive, fueling nativist sentiment and pitting local politicians against the blocâs leaders. Western Europe no longer seemed to be the only option.
At the time, Beijing was beginning to pour money and political capital into Eastern and Central Europe as part of a broad bid to increase its heft in Europe. Chinaâs leaders see the region as potentially fertile ground. While Britain, France and Germany welcomed greater investments from Beijing, they still bucked Chinaâs stances on issues like human rights and its claim to control almost all of the South China Sea. Eastern and Central Europe didnât have the same qualms.
Looking for further inroads, China started what came to be called the 16+1 initiative, an effort to expand cooperation with more than a dozen Eastern and Central European nations. It became a forum for China to show off what it could offer the region, like access to technology for a high-speed rail system. Mr. Xi later included Eastern and Central Europe in his Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious plan to develop economic and diplomatic ties through infrastructure projects around the world.
Chinaâs influence in Europe is already apparent. Greece last year blocked a European Union statement in the United Nations criticizing Chinaâs human rights record. Greece and Hungary worked to water down a 2016 European Union statement regarding the South China Sea.
For Mr. Zeman, the courtship basically had to start from scratch.
The former Czechoslovakia recognized the Communist-led China in 1949, but a rift between Moscow and Beijing kept them apart. The post-Soviet Czech Republic, remembering the brutal 1968 Soviet crackdown on reform efforts in Prague and subsequent Communist domination, found common cause with Beijingâs critics.
Vaclav Havel, the anti-Communist activist and the countryâs first leader after the fall of the Berlin Wall, invited the Dalai Lama to a state visit in 1990, angering Beijing. He had stern words for China. âIntimidation, propaganda campaigns, and repression,â he wrote, âare no substitute for reasoned dialogue.â
Mr. Zeman, a well-known smoker and drinker who once publicly denied that he showed up at his inauguration drunk, broke with that history. He rejected Havel-era support for the Dalai Lama and its close ties to the government of Taiwan.
He visited China in 2014, the first visit by a Czech leader in nearly a decade. A year later, he was the only European Union leader to attend a military parade celebrating the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. That helped him secure Mr. Xiâs 2016 visit to Prague.
âThis is a restart,â Mr. Zeman told Chinese official media before Mr. Xiâs visit, adding that the previous government had been âvery submissiveâ to the United States and the European Union.
âNow, we are again an independent country,â he said, âand we formulate our foreign policy, which is based on our own national interests, and we do not interfere with the internal affairs of any other country.â

His focus on China won wide praise from the Czech political apparatus.
âIf anybody thinks that under current circumstances it is possible to create safe and prosperous world without cooperation with China, then he has missed the train long ago,â said Katerina Konecna, vice chairman of the Czech Republicâs Communist Party.
Mr. Zemanâs office said its efforts to court China were no different from the efforts of others.
âThose that have expressed such criticism offend our Western allies who collaborate extraordinarily tightly with the Peopleâs Republic of China,â said Jiri Ovcacek, a spokesman for Mr. Zeman. Mr. Zemanâs office didnât respond to further requests for comment.
A Shadowy Suitor
Mr. Zemanâs 2014 visit proved fateful for the Czech Republic. Among the business deals reached was a cooperation pact between a Czech financial firm and an up-and-coming energy company called CEFC.
It was led by Ye Jianming, who was born in a small village in the southern Chinese province of Fujian. He grabbed hold of assets once controlled by a notorious smuggler and in a few years parlayed them into a sprawling business empire with 30,000 employees. Mr. Ye traveled the world on his twin-engine Airbus 319 private jet, meeting heads of state, Russian oligarchs and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.
CEFC was modeled on Mr. Xiâs vision of a stronger China â and it went where Mr. Xi wanted China to go. It struck deals in the United Arab Emirates and Kazakhstan. It courted top leaders in places like Albania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Sudan and Uganda. Last year, it agreed to buy a $9 billion stake in Rosneft, the Russian oil giant, which put it firmly in the middle of the complicated but important relationship between Beijing and Moscow.
Its fast rise fueled rumors in China that Mr. Ye had ties to Mr. Xi, who once worked in Fujian, or other Chinese leaders. CEFC did little to discourage them. Mr. Ye was part of a group tied to the Chinese military, according to documents and experts. On its website, CEFC cited the military and Communist Party experience of its top executives.
The Czech Republic made a tempting target for CEFCâs international push. The country was a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was disillusioned with the West and ready to do business.
CEFC bought a stake in Florentinum, one of Pragueâs biggest office complexes. It invested in the Czech national airline, two hotels and a pair of Renaissance-era buildings. It bought a brewery that traces its roots back more than 700 years.
Mr. Zemanâs staff trumpeted the deals as proof that courting China made economic sense.
âPeople believed the rhetoric,â said Olga Lomova, the head of the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation International Sinological Center of Charles University in Prague. âWe have the Chinese. We will be happy again.â
CEFC also hired figures close to Mr. Zeman, leading to accusations from critics of a revolving door between the Chinese company and the president. Jaroslav Tvrdik, the countryâs former minister of defense, was hired to run CEFCâs Czech operations while serving as an adviser on China to the government. Czech officials defended keeping Mr. Tvrdik as an adviser, saying the position was unpaid.
Miroslav Sklenar, Mr. Zemanâs protocol chief, left that position in 2015 for a role at CEFC. He returned to the presidential palace at the end of 2016.
Early on, CEFC worried that its growing involvement would upset the public. Its solution: Buy the local soccer team.
Slavia Prague had been on the brink of bankruptcy when CEFC purchased a majority stake in 2015. The team began to spend heavily under its new owner, retaining its star forward, Milan Å koda, and signing a Dutch player, Gino van Kessel. Last year, the club won its first league championship since 2009. Slavia Prague played in uniforms that said âCEFC Chinaâ in Roman letters and in Chinese characters.
CEFCâs deals made little business sense to observers. âSo many of the acquisitions were made in a rush, and were nonsense,â said Ms. Lomova, of Charles University. âThey were not investments that were able to pay for themselves.â
And CEFC acknowledged that its motivations went beyond business. âOur company cares about what we can do to bridge the cultural gap,â Jiang Chunyu, a senior executive at CEFC said at a forum in China in December.
Promises Undone
Mr. Xiâs historic 2016 visit to Prague showed the China-Czech relationship to be the closest in the history of the two countries. It also showed that cracks were forming.
Thousands of protesters tried to greet the Chinese leader as he met with Mr. Zeman in Prague Castle. Members of both the Czech and European parliaments joined. One lawmaker, who owns a home on the hill beneath the castle, set up a projector to cast the words âTruth and Loveâ on the castle wall â an invocation of a famous quote of Havelâs, who said that truth and love would vanquish lies and hatred. Flags lining Mr. Xiâs route from the airport were defaced.
Czech authorities, with the help of CEFC, tried to obscure the tensions. Police officers blocked demonstrators from getting too close to the castle, setting off complaints from protesters about police violence.
âWhy are the police protecting the Chinese and limiting the ability of the Czech people to express themselves?â said Ondrej Kolar, the mayor of a Prague district.
Wherever Mr. Xi traveled, busloads of local Chinese supporters appeared, too.
Filip Lexa, a 33-year-old teacher and doctoral student studying Chinese literature, said he showed up with a flag representing the Uighur minority of western China, where the authorities there have cracked down on the local population. He said he was harassed by a group of Chinese men bused into the event.
âWhen I took the flag out, everyone attacked me,â he said, adding that he escaped serious injury. âThey pulled me into the middle of this group and started kicking me and hitting me with the flag poles they were carrying. One even broke a pole on my back.â
CEFC played a major role in trying to make sure the Chinese presidentâs visit went smoothly, said Mr. Kolar, the mayor who was involved in preparations for the event because his district is home to a number of embassies.
âIt wasnât organized by the state, but by a private company,â he said. âCEFC organized the whole event.â
CEFC arranged for the display of Chinese flags along the route through Mr. Kolarâs neighborhood â flags with red and yellow color reminiscent of the Soviet Union. When some were defaced, CEFC workers replaced them.
âIt felt like the â70s or â80s again,â Mr. Kolar said. âThen it was revealed that it was CEFC who paid for those flags.â
Many Czechs had other reasons to sour on the relationship with China. Investment figures have proved disappointing â Taiwanâs investment in 2017 was nearly three times that of Chinaâs, according to data from Sinopsis, a research group focused on China. Mr. Zeman attributed the shortfall to new Chinese limits on money flowing abroad.
The revocation of an award to a famous Czech Holocaust survivor also set off outrage. George Brady, an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, was set to be honored at a Czech state dinner in 2016 and receive a medal for his work. His sister, Hana Brady, died in the gas chambers in Auschwitz, and he had turned her story into a popular childrenâs book called âHanaâs Suitcase.â
But his nephew was the Czech Republicâs culture minister â and he was set to meet with the Dalai Lama. Before the ceremony, the nephew, Daniel Herman, received a call from Mr. Zemanâs office.
âI was told that if I went ahead with a meeting with the Dalai Lama, there would be no medal,â Mr. Herman said in an interview. He went ahead with the meeting. âAnd there was no ceremony,â he said.
Czech officials acknowledged that Mr. Zeman asked Mr. Herman not to meet with the Dalai Lama. They said the withdrawal of the medal was unrelated, although they did not specify a reason.
But Chinaâs biggest challenge to its Czech strategy began elsewhere.
In November, American authorities arrested Patrick Ho, a top executive of CEFCâs nonprofit arm, and charged him with offering bribes to officials in Uganda and Chad in exchange for oil rights.
Czech officials and one person with direct knowledge of Mr. Yeâs case say he was detained by the Chinese authorities after Mr. Hoâs arrest. A short time later, the company was hit with a number of problems. Its bid for a stake in Rosneft collapsed. And Chinese rating firms warned that CEFC had taken on considerable debt.
In April, Mr. Zeman met with officials from Citic Group, a state-controlled Chinese company that had agreed to buy just under half of CEFCâs Europe venture. While Mr. Yeâs ties to Chinaâs leadership had been just rumored, Citic is a company firmly under Beijingâs control. Citic didnât respond to requests for comment.
If a direct role for Beijing in Czech businesses bothered Mr. Zeman, he has shown little public sign. He is set to make another visit to the Chinese capital this autumn.

Google Tried to Change China. China May End Up Changing Google.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2092935029?accountid=14586,"Ever since its founding 20 years ago in a Silicon Valley garage, Google has proudly and often ostentatiously held itself up as the architect of a new model for corporate virtue.
âGoogle is not a conventional company,â the search engineâs founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, told investors as part of the initial public offering in 2004. Google, they said, would always put long-term values over short-term financial gain. âMaking the world a better placeâ would be a primary business goal, and Googleâs ethical compass could be summed up in a simple and celebrated motto: âDonât be evil.â
In the years since, Googleâs once-revolutionary sensibility has been adopted and watered down by much of the rest of the tech industry, becoming the stuff of parody and skepticism. Google itself has played down its former zealousness; Alphabet, its parent company, recently dropped some references to â d onât be evilâ from its code of conduct.
Still, if you work at Google or have bought into its missionary brand, you can point to moments when its ethos did rise to something more than marketing puffery. The most obvious example: In 2010, after four years of attempting to operate a censored search engine in China under a regime there that was becoming increasingly hostile to online freedoms, Google did something that a more conventional company would not have done. It said that it had had enough, and pulled its search engine out of the massive market.
Now, Google appears to be changing its mind. Under a plan called Dragonfly, the company has been testing a censored version of its search engine for the Chinese market. In a meeting with employees last week, Sundar Pichai, Googleâs chief executive, said that âwe are not close to launchingâ a search engine in China, but he defended the companyâs exploration of the market.
The defenses are not unsound. Under any rational business sense, it would be insane to expect one of the worldâs largest internet companies to stay out of the worldâs largest internet market, especially when many of Googleâs American rivals happily operate under that governmentâs intrusive rules. China is Appleâs third-largest market, and Microsoft and Amazon both offer a host of services there.
But wasnât standing apart supposed to be the hallmark of Googleâs Googliness? Leaving China was the kind of unorthodox decision the search company once reveled in â a move that sacrificed financial prosperity for the moral high ground, that showed employees and customers that Google, with its planet-swallowing mission to organize all of lifeâs information, was motivated by something deeper than financial ambition.
Activists for online freedoms worry that Googleâs return would have dangerous real-world consequences, perhaps accelerating a great new wave of online restrictions in China and elsewhere. But the most lasting impact might be in how we would have to reimagine what kind of company Google was and what it stood for.
It is hard to see how going back to China would be anything other than a terrific comedown â the most telling act of a company that, day by day, has come to resemble the utterly conventional corporation it once vowed never to become.
âIf Google wants to be judged like any other global company, thatâs fine,â said Ben Wizner, director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. âThey should just say so â that their principal obligation is to their shareholders and their bottom line. But that has not been the rhetoric coming out of Google, and I think itâs fair to judge them by the standards they have set for themselves.â
In a statement, a Google spokesman said that âwe donât comment on speculation about future plans.â But the companyâs leaders have disputed the idea that returning to China would be a moral reversal. At last weekâs staff meeting, Mr. Pichai suggested that returning to China would be in accord with the vision the company had in 2006, when it first agreed to censor results to accommodate Beijing.
At the time, the company said in a blog post that âfiltering our search results clearly compromises our missionâ but added, âFailing to offer Google search at all to a fifth of the worldâs population, however, does so far more severely.â
Mr. Pichai underlined this argument â that providing some access to the outside world is better than none â by citing his experience growing up in India.
âMy dad worked for a U.K. company, and they went through whether they should be in India or should they pull out,â he told Googleâs staff, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. âAnd they stayed, and that made a difference for my dad. And in all likelihood, I wouldnât be here today if it werenât for that.â
There are other factors behind Googleâs potential reversal. The internet has changed a great deal since 2010, and the companyâs executives have increasingly come to see their decision to leave China as rash, naÃ¯ve and ultimately counterproductive.
Googleâs decision was set in motion by a Chinese hack into its services that was meant to uncover dissidents and spies. The attack shocked and angered Googleâs founders. In interviews, Mr. Brin, who was born in the Soviet Union, compared the Chinese government to the âtotalitarian forcesâ that had shaped his youth. He and other executives suggested that taking a stand in China might set a kind of red line for repressive regimes elsewhere.
âI think that in the long term, they are going to have to open,â Mr. Brin told The Times.
Since then, Chinaâs rules have only hardened, while a host of other governments have stepped up efforts to police speech online.
Now even many democratic governments are adopting stringent curbs on online speech. For instance, in Europe, a âright to be forgottenâ rule has forced Google and other search engines to remove results that are judged to invade peopleâs privacy, and more rules governing hate speech and propaganda are in the works. Meanwhile, Edward Snowdenâs leaks showed that the American and British governments have also hacked large internet companies, including Google.
âThis argument makes me very sad: The world is becoming more like China, so therefore we might as well be in China,â said Rebecca MacKinnon, an internet freedom advocate at New America, a think tank.
She said that advocates of free speech and human rights had long found Google to be an ally in their efforts, and that a reversal in China would be regarded as a major defeat.
âI wrote a book where I warned that China is Exhibit A for how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and then begin to change the internet,â Ms. MacKinnon said. âAnd if companies like Google are now throwing in the towel and saying, âWell, thatâs where the internet is goingâ and âIf you canât beat âem, join âemâ â well, thatâs deeply troubling.â
If Google does go back to China, it will very likely have to agree to an even more restrictive censorship regime than what it tolerated previously. Mr. Pichai has vowed to be transparent about how such a plan might roll out. But advocates said transparency alone would not mitigate their worries about Googleâs shift.
âIf Google is trying to promote openness and free societies, then transparency is going to be an insufficient way to make this better,â said Mr. Wizner of the A.C.L.U. âThe transparency would be aimed at the rest of the world. Google wouldnât be telling Chinese people, âHereâs what you canât see.ââ
Sure, itâs early, and Googleâs plans are not clear. There remains the possibility that Google will think of some completely nontraditional way to satisfy Chinaâs censors without losing its soul.
But that seems unlikely. The more plausible conclusion is the more obvious one: Google took on China, and Google lost.
âMake no mistake,â said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at New York Universityâs Stern School of Business, âthis will be a huge victory for the Chinese government and anyone else who wants to severely restrict the internet.â

"As Trade War Intensifies, China Moves to Bolster Its Economy","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2092935895?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI â As Chinaâs economy slows and the trade war with the United States intensifies, Beijingâs economic bosses are swinging into action.
Chinese officials are pushing banks to lend more and allowing indebted local governments to spend money on big projects again. They have moved to shore up the value of the countryâs currency. They have also helped out the stock market, say financial analysts, as the government works to avert a stock market collapse like the one three years ago that shook the world.
âItâs a line in the sand for the leadershipâ of China, said Hao Hong, the research director for the international operations of the Bank of Communications, a Shanghai-based financial institution.
China is taking action as its problems mount. On Thursday the United States formally enacted its previously threatened tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese-made goods. Beijing said it would immediately retaliate with its own tariffs and file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The moves intensify a trade war that has already affected more than $100 billion of goods and cast a shadow over growth prospects for China and the world.
China is playing a difficult game. It must deal with its weakening economy without worsening its onerous debt problems. At the same time, it has to shore up the situation at home if it hopes to continue to retaliate against President Trumpâs trade war broadsides.
So far, the trade war has had only a minor impact on Chinaâs vast, $12 trillion economy. But the trade war complicates Chinaâs deeper problems with its onerous debt levels. China has worked to wean its economy off its dependence on borrowing, but the resulting slowdown in growth has undercut that effort, leading Beijing to relent somewhat from the initiative. Should the trade war take a greater toll, China could direct its banks to expand lending further.
âThe Chinese government always oscillates between maintaining stability and achieving quality growth,â said Zhigang Tao, a Hong Kong University economist. âWhen you see the government switch to stimulus, it generally means the government cares about stability.â
Chinaâs softening economy has led some within the Trump Administration to believe Beijing is vulnerable, which could lead the White House to escalate the trade war even further. Larry Kudlow, the director of President Trumpâs National Economic Council, pointed out during a Cabinet meeting last week that Chinaâs own official statistics for business investment, retail sales and industrial production have shown weakness in recent months.
âRight now, their economy looks terrible,â he said during the meeting, which was open to the media.
Chinaâs most recent quarterly economic figures suggest growth is continuing at a steady pace. But economists generally dismiss those official numbers, which are much smoother and more predictable than the economic figures posted by the United States and other major countries.
Other indicators suggest a mild softening. Some consumers appear to be holding back. Infrastructure spending, which encompasses up to one-sixth of the Chinese economy, slowed sharply through the first seven months of this year.
The city of Harbin, a provincial capital in northeastern China, ran out of money last month to pay pensioners, and had to rearrange its finances to pay them later. Corporate bond defaults have increased this year, although they are still low by international standards. The countryâs banks acknowledged last month a fairly sharp uptick in nonperforming loans, although that was partly driven by tighter auditing standards.
Signals of serious financial and economic weakness have prompted the Beijing authorities to rush out their series of measures since the end of July.
China is taking steps to make sure its companies and spenders have enough money. The central bank announced on Aug. 10 that it would make sure enough credit reached companies. Chinaâs banking regulator announced on Aug. 11 and again over the weekend that it wanted the countryâs state-controlled banking sector to provide ample credit to exporters, small and medium-size businesses and infrastructure projects.
Regulators are taking other steps to give banks the financial space needed to step up lending. The official China Securities Journal reported on Tuesday that financial regulations may soon be changed to let banks keep practically limitless holdings of local government bonds without including them in their calculations of their ability to endure hard times. The move wonât help China deal with the huge debt racked up by local governments in recent years, but it does free up money for banks to lend.
The authorities are also encouraging local projects. The Finance Ministry is helping deeply indebted local governments borrow far more money this autumn so that they can restart stalled infrastructure projects. Chinaâs central planners have allowed a series of big local government projects to proceed that had previously been blocked because of debt concerns. This includes the construction of five subway and light rail lines in Changchun, a big industrial city in northeastern China where Toyota, the Japanese automaker, has extensive facilities.
The financial markets are getting a boost as well.
Through the spring and summer, share prices slid into a bear market, and Chinaâs currency, the renminbi, dropped nearly 10 percent against the dollar. Since then, China â which keeps a tight grip on the value of its currency â has pushed it to gain value against the dollar.
Meanwhile, the stock market has risen in a move that analysts say has been helped by intervention from big, government-connected investors, a group sometimes known as the National Team. On Friday, Chinese share prices fell to their lowest closing level since early 2016. But through Thursday, the Shanghai stock market had risen almost 2 percent this week.
China has also moved forcefully to reassure common investors. Its banking regulator has begun encouraging the countryâs four big asset management companies to aid highly speculative peer-to-peer lending schemes that have been collapsing in recent months, though the details of that help remain unclear. And the government has deferred plans for a more stringent crackdown on various kinds of informal lending, or shadow banking, including off-balance sheet lending by banks.
Other data show how China is trying to pull off a difficult balancing act. Even as Chinese officials push for more lending, a broader measure of borrowing showed the overall flow of fresh credit slowed in July. That suggested lingering effects from the authoritiesâ previous efforts to crack down on some of the murkier parts of the vast but rickety Chinese financial system.
Tolerating even more borrowing by heavily indebted local governments is a short-term measure that could create long-term problems.
Liu He, a vice premier and close adviser to Chinaâs leader, Xi Jinping, pledged in January that Beijing would bring the countryâs debt under control within three years. Beijing had clamped down on some bank lending to state-owned enterprises over the last few years, data from the Bank of International Settlements has shown. Letting local governments borrow more runs counter to that.
âThe focus is no longer on deleveraging, but on transferring leverage from one sector to another,â said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.
The injections of money by the government into the economy now may offset the withdrawal of money last spring during the deleveraging campaign, but may not be enough to spur an actual boom in the debt-laden Chinese economy, said Rodney Jones, a principal at Wigram Capital Advisors, a Beijing economic research firm.
âIâm really skeptical that stimulus creates a surge of growth like we have seen in the past,â he said. âI think stimulus takes out some of the downside.â

"With Ships and Missiles, China Is Ready to Challenge U.S. Navy in Pacific","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2095810827?accountid=14586,"DALIAN, China â In April, on the 69th anniversary of the founding of Chinaâs Navy, the countryâs first domestically built aircraft carrier stirred from its berth in the port city of Dalian on the Bohai Sea, tethered to tugboats for a test of its seaworthiness.
âChinaâs first homegrown aircraft carrier just moved a bit, and the United States, Japan and India squirmed,â a military news website crowed, referring to the three nations China views as its main rivals.
Not long ago, such boasts would have been dismissed as the bravado of a second-string military. No longer.
A modernization program focused on naval and missile forces has shifted the balance of power in the Pacific in ways the United States and its allies are only beginning to digest.
While China lags in projecting firepower on a global scale, it can now challenge American military supremacy in the places that matter most to it: the waters around Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.
That means a growing section of the Pacific Ocean â where the United States has operated unchallenged since the naval battles of World War II â is once again contested territory, with Chinese warships and aircraft regularly bumping up against those of the United States and its allies.
To prevail in these waters, according to officials and analysts who scrutinize Chinese military developments, China does not need a military that can defeat the United States outright but merely one that can make intervention in the region too costly for Washington to contemplate. Many analysts say Beijing has already achieved that goal.
To do so, it has developed âanti-accessâ capabilities that use radar, satellites and missiles to neutralize the decisive edge that Americaâs powerful aircraft carrier strike groups have enjoyed. It is also rapidly expanding its naval forces with the goal of deploying a âblue waterâ navy that would allow it to defend its growing interests beyond its coastal waters.
âChina is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,â the new commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Philip S. Davidson, acknowledged in written remarks submitted during his Senate confirmation process in March.
He described China as a âpeer competitorâ gaining on the United States not by matching its forces weapon by weapon but by building critical âasymmetrical capabilities,â including with anti-ship missiles and in submarine warfare. âThere is no guarantee that the United States would win a future conflict with China,â he concluded.
Last year, the Chinese Navy became the worldâs largest, with more warships and submarines than the United States, and it continues to build new ships at a stunning rate. Though the American fleet remains superior qualitatively, it is spread much thinner.
âThe task of building a powerful navy has never been as urgent as it is today,â President Xi Jinping declared in April as he presided over a naval procession off the southern Chinese island of Hainan that opened exercises involving 48 ships and submarines. The Ministry of National Defense said they were the largest since the Peopleâs Republic of China was founded in 1949.
Even as the United States wages a trade war against China, Chinese warships and aircraft have picked up the pace of operations in the waters off Japan, Taiwan, and the islands, shoals and reefs it has claimed in the South China Sea over the objections of Vietnam and the Philippines.
When two American warships â the Higgins, a destroyer, and the Antietam, a cruiser â sailed within a few miles of disputed islands in the Paracels in May, Chinese vessels rushed to challenge what Beijing later denounced as âa provocative act.â China did the same to three Australian ships passing through the South China Sea in April.
Only three years ago, Mr. Xi stood beside President Barack Obama in the Rose Garden and promised not to militarize artificial islands it has built farther south in the Spratlys archipelago. Chinese officials have since acknowledged deploying missiles there, but argue that they are necessary because of American âincursionsâ in Chinese waters.
When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Beijing in June, Mr. Xi bluntly warned him that China would not yield âeven one inchâ of territory it claims as its own.
âAnti-Access/Area Denialâ
Chinaâs naval expansion began in 2000 but accelerated sharply after Mr. Xi took command in 2013. He has drastically shifted the militaryâs focus to naval as well as air and strategic rocket forces, while purging commanders accused of corruption and cutting the traditional land forces.
The Peopleâs Liberation Army â the bedrock of Communist power since the revolution â has actually shrunk in order to free up resources for a more modern fighting force. Since 2015, the army has cut 300,000 enlisted soldiers and officers, paring the military to two million personnel over all, compared with 1.4 million in the United States.
While every branch of Chinaâs armed forces lags behind the United Statesâ in firepower and experience, China has made significant gains in asymmetrical weaponry to blunt Americaâs advantages. One focus has been in what American military planners call A2/AD, for âanti-access/area denial,â or what the Chinese call âcounter-intervention.â
A centerpiece of this strategy is an arsenal of high-speed ballistic missiles designed to strike moving ships. The latest versions, the DF-21D and, since 2016, the DF-26, are popularly known as âcarrier killers,â since they can threaten the most powerful vessels in the American fleet long before they get close to China.
The DF-26, which made its debut in a military parade in Beijing in 2015 and was tested in the Bohai Sea last year, has a range that would allow it to menace ships and bases as far away as Guam, according to the latest Pentagon report on the Chinese military, released this month. These missiles are almost impossible to detect and intercept, and are directed at moving targets by an increasingly sophisticated Chinese network of radar and satellites.
China announced in April that the DF-26 had entered service. State television showed rocket launchers carrying 22 of them, though the number deployed now is unknown. A brigade equipped with them is reported to be based in Henan Province, in central China.
Such missiles pose a particular challenge to American commanders because neutralizing them might require an attack deep inside Chinese territory, which would be a major escalation.
The American Navy has never faced such a threat before, the Congressional Research Office warned in a report in May, adding that some analysts consider the missiles âgame changing.â
The âcarrier killersâ have been supplemented by the deployment this year of missiles in the South China Sea. The weaponry includes the new YJ-12B anti-ship cruise missile, which puts most of the waters between the Philippines and Vietnam in range.
While all-out war between China and the United States seems unthinkable, the Chinese military is preparing for âa limited military conflict from the sea,â according to a 2013 paper in a journal called The Science of Military Strategy.
Lyle Morris, an analyst with the RAND Corporation, said that Chinaâs deployment of missiles in the disputed Paracel and Spratly Islands âwill dramatically change how the U.S. military operatesâ across Asia and the Pacific.
The best American response, he added, would be âto find new and innovative methodsâ of deploying ships outside their range. Given the longer range of the ballistic missiles, however, that is not possible âin most contingenciesâ the American Navy would be likely to face in Asia.
Blue-Water Ambitions
The aircraft carrier that put to sea in April for its first trials is Chinaâs second, but the first built domestically. It is the most prominent manifestation of a modernization project meant to propel the country into the upper tier of military powers. Only the United States, with 11 nuclear-powered carriers, operates more than one.
A third Chinese carrier is under construction in a port near Shanghai. Analysts believe China will eventually build five or six.
The Chinese military, traditionally focused on repelling a land invasion, increasingly aims to project power into the âblue watersâ of the world to protect Chinaâs expanding economic and diplomatic interests, from the Pacific to the Atlantic.
The carriers attract the most attention but Chinaâs naval expansion has been far broader. The Chinese Navy â officially the Peopleâs Liberation Army Navy â has built more than 100 warships and submarines in the last decade alone, more than the entire naval fleets of all but a handful of nations.
Last year, China also introduced the first of a new class of a heavy cruisers â or âsuper destroyersâ â that, according to the American Office of Naval Intelligence, âare comparable in many respects to most modern Western warships.â Two more were launched from dry dock in Dalian in July, the state media reported.
Last year, China counted 317 warships and submarines in active service, compared with 283 in the United States Navy, which has been essentially unrivaled in the open seas since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Unlike the Soviet Union, which drained its coffers during the Cold War arms race, military spending in China is a manageable percentage of a growing economy. Beijingâs defense budget now ranks second only to the United States: $228 billion to $610 billion, according to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
The roots of Chinaâs focus on sea power and âarea denialâ can be traced to what many Chinese viewed as humiliation in 1995 and 1996. When Taiwan moved to hold its first democratic elections, China fired missiles near the island, prompting President Bill Clinton to dispatch two aircraft carriers to the region.
âWe avoided the sea, took it as a moat and a joyful little pond to the Middle Kingdom,â a naval analyst, Chen Guoqiang, wrote recently in the official Navy newspaper. âSo not only did we lose all the advantages of the sea but also our territories became the prey of the imperialist powers.â
Chinaâs naval buildup since then has been remarkable. In 1995, China had only three submarines. It now has nearly 60 and plans to expand to nearly 80, according to a report last month by the United States Congressional Research Service.
As it has in its civilian economy, China has bought or absorbed technologies from the rest of the world, in some cases illicitly. Much of its military hardware is of Soviet origin or modeled on antiquated Soviet designs, but with each new wave of production, analysts say, China is deploying more advanced capabilities.
Chinaâs first aircraft carrier was originally launched by the Soviet Union in 1988 and left to rust when the nation collapsed three years later. Newly independent Ukraine sold it for $20 million to a Chinese investor who claimed it would become a floating casino, though he was really acting on behalf of Beijing, which refurbished the vessel and named it the Liaoning.
The second aircraft carrier â as yet unnamed â is largely based on the Liaoningâs designs, but is reported to have enhanced technology. In February, the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation disclosed that it has plans to build nuclear-powered carriers, which have far greater endurance than ones that require refueling stops.
Chinaâs military has encountered some growing pains. It is hampered by corruption, which Mr. Xi has vowed to wipe out, and a lack of combat experience. As a fighting force, it remains untested by combat.
In January, it was embarrassed when one of its most advanced submarines was detected as it neared disputed islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. The attack submarine should never have been spotted.
The second aircraft carrier also appears to have experienced hiccups. Its first sea trials were announced in April and then inexplicably delayed. Not long after the trials went ahead in May, the general manager of China Shipbuilding was placed under investigation for âserious violation of laws and discipline,â the official Xinhua news agency reported, without elaborating.
Defending Its Claims
Chinaâs military advances have nonetheless emboldened the countryâs leadership.
The state media declared the carrier Liaoning âcombat readyâ in the summer after it moved with six other warships through the Miyako Strait that splits Japanâs Ryukyu Islands and conducted its first flight operations in the Pacific.
The Liaoningâs battle group now routinely circles Taiwan. So do Chinese fighter jets and bombers.
Chinaâs new J-20 stealth fighter conducted its first training mission at sea in May, while its strategic bomber, the H-6, landed for the first time on Woody Island in the Paracels. From the airfield there or from those in the Spratly Islands, the bombers could strike all of Southeast Asia.
The recent Pentagon report noted that H-6 flights in the Pacific were intended to demonstrate the ability to strike American bases in Japan and South Korea, and as far away as Guam.
âCompetition is the American way of seeing it,â said Li Jie, an analyst with the Chinese Naval Research Institute in Beijing. âChina is simply protecting its rights and its interests in the Pacific.â
And Chinaâs interests are expanding.
In 2017, it opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, saying that it will be used to support its participation in multinational antipiracy patrols off Somalia.
It now appears to be planning to acquire access to a network of ports and bases throughout the Indian Ocean. Though ostensibly commercial, these projects have laid the groundwork for a necklace of refueling and resupply arrangements that will âfacilitate Beijingâs long-range naval operations,â according to a new report by C4ADS, a research organization in Washington.
âThey soon will be able, for example, to send a squadron of ships to somewhere, say in Africa, and have all the capabilities to make a landing in force to protect Chinese assets,â said Vassily Kashin, an expert with the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.
The need was driven home in 2015 when Chinese warships evacuated 629 Chinese and 279 foreigners from Yemen when the countryâs civil war raged in Aden, a southern port city.
One of the frigates involved in the rescue, the Linyi, was featured in a patriotic blockbuster film, âOperation Red Sea.â
âThe Chinese are going to be more present,â Mr. Kashin added, âand everyone has to get used to it.â

China Is Detaining Muslims in Vast Numbers. The Goal: âTransformation.â,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2101404903?accountid=14586,"HOTAN, China â On the edge of a desert in far western China, an imposing building sits behind a fence topped with barbed wire. Large red characters on the facade urge people to learn Chinese, study law and acquire job skills. Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.
Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination program, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write âself-criticismâ essays, according to detainees who have been released.
The goal is to remove any devotion to Islam.
Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr. Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.
âThat was not a place for getting rid of extremism,â he recalled. âThat was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.â
This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breathtaking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.
Though limited to Chinaâs western region of Xinjiang, it is the countryâs most sweeping internment program since the Mao era â and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.
China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.
After a succession of violent antigovernment attacks reached a peak in 2014, the Communist Party chief, Xi Jinping, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.
âXinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,â Mr. Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media last year.
In addition to the mass detentions, the authorities have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some peopleâs homes. Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatized Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.
âPenetration of everyday life is almost really total now,â said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra. âYou have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.â
China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a United Nations panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.
âThere is no arbitrary detention,â Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. âThere is no such thing as re-education centers.â
The committee pressed Beijing to disclose how many people have been detained and free them, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the demand as having âno factual basisâ and said Chinaâs security measures were comparable to those of other countries.
The governmentâs business-as-usual defense, however, is contradicted by overwhelming evidence, including official directives, studies, news reports and construction plans that have surfaced online, as well as the eyewitness accounts of a growing number of former detainees who have fled to countries such as Turkey and Kazakhstan.
The governmentâs own documents describe a vast network of camps â usually called âtransformation through educationâ centers â that has expanded without public debate, specific legislative authority or any system of appeal for those detained.
The New York Times interviewed four recent camp inmates from Xinjiang who described physical and verbal abuse by guards; grinding routines of singing, lectures and self-criticism meetings; and the gnawing anxiety of not knowing when they would be released. Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.
The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives, and a study published last year that said officials in some places were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.
The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. âRecklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously usedâ in some areas, she wrote. âThe targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.â
Eradicating a âVirusâ
The long days in the re-education camp usually began with a jog.
Nearly every morning, Mr. Muhemet recalled, he and dozens of others â college graduates, businessmen, farmers â were told to run around an assembly ground. Impatient guards sometimes slapped and shoved the older, slower inmates, he said.
Then they were made to sing rousing patriotic hymns in Chinese, such as âWithout the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China.â Those who could not remember the words were denied breakfast, and they all learned the words quickly.
Mr. Muhemet, a stocky man who ran a restaurant in Hotan before fleeing China this year, said he spent seven months in a police cell and more than two months in the camp in 2015 without ever being charged with a crime. Most days, he said, the camp inmates assembled to hear long lectures by officials who warned them not to embrace Islamic radicalism, support Uighur independence or defy the Communist Party.
The officials did not ban Islam but dictated very narrow limits for how it should be practiced, including a prohibition against praying at home if there were friends or guests present, he said. In other sessions, the inmates were forced to memorize laws and write essays criticizing themselves.
âIn the end, all the officials had one key point,â he said. âThe greatness of the Chinese Communist Party, the backwardness of Uighur culture and the advanced nature of Chinese culture.â
After two months, Mr. Muhemetâs family was finally allowed to visit the camp, located near âNew Harmony Village,â a settlement built as a symbol of friendship between ethnic Uighurs and the majority Han Chinese. âI couldnât say anything,â he recalled. âI just held my two sons and wife, and cried and cried.â
The Xinjiang government issued âderadicalizationâ rules last year that gave vague authorization for the camps, and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.
Some facilities are designed for inmates who are allowed to go home at night. Others can house thousands around the clock. One camp outside Hotan has grown in the past two years from a few small buildings to facilities on at least 36 acres, larger than Alcatraz Island, and work appears to be underway to expand it further, according to satellite photos.
In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.
âAnyone infected with an ideological âvirusâ must be swiftly sent for the âresidential careâ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises,â a document issued by party authorities in Hotan said.
The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps a million, with exile Uighur groups saying the number is even higher.
About 1.5 percent of Chinaâs total population lives in Xinjiang. But the region accounted for more than 20 percent of arrests nationwide last year, according to official data compiled by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group. Those figures do not include people in the re-education camps.
Residents said people have been sent to the camps for visiting relatives abroad; for possessing books about religion and Uighur culture; and even for wearing a T-shirt with a Muslim crescent. Women are sometimes detained because of transgressions by their husbands or sons.
One official directive warns people to look for 75 signs of âreligious extremism,â including behavior that would be considered unremarkable in other countries: growing a beard as a young man, praying in public places outside mosques or even abruptly trying to give up smoking or drinking.
âWe Are in Troubleâ
Hotan feels as if under siege by an invisible enemy. Fortified police outposts and checkpoints dot the streets every few hundred yards. Schools, kindergartens, gas stations and hospitals are garlanded in barbed wire. Surveillance cameras sprout from shops, apartment entrances and metal poles.
âItâs very tense here,â a police officer said. âWe havenât rested for three years.â
This city of 390,000 underwent a Muslim revival about a decade ago. Most Uighurs have adhered to relatively relaxed forms of Sunni Islam, and a significant number are secular. But budding prosperity and growing interaction with the Middle East fueled interest in stricter Islamic traditions. Men grew long beards, while women wore hijabs that were not a part of traditional Uighur dress.
Now the beards and hijabs are gone, and posters warn against them. Mosques appear poorly attended; people must register to enter and worship under the watch of surveillance cameras.
The government shifted to harsher policies in 2009 after protests in Xinjiangâs capital, Urumqi, spiraled into rioting and left nearly 200 people dead. Mr. Xi and his regional functionaries went further, adopting methods reminiscent of Maoâs draconian rule â mass rallies, public confessions and âwork teamsâ assigned to ferret out dissent.
They have also wired dusty towns across Xinjiang with an array of technology that has put the region on the cutting edge of programs for surveillance cameras as well as facial and voice recognition. Spending on security in Xinjiang has soared, with nearly $8.5 billion allocated for the police, courts and other law enforcement agencies last year, nearly double the previous yearâs amount.
The campaign has polarized Uighur society. Many of the ground-level enforcers are Uighurs themselves, including police officers and officials who staff the camps and security checkpoints.
Ordinary Uighurs moving about Hotan sometimes shuffle on and off buses several times to pass through metal detectors, swipe their identity cards or hand over and unlock their mobile phones for inspection.
A resident or local cadre is assigned to monitor every 10 families in Xinjiang, reporting on comings and goings and activities deemed suspicious, including praying and visits to mosques, according to residents and government reports. Residents said the police sometimes search homes for forbidden books and suspect items such as prayer mats, using special equipment to check walls and floors for hidden caches.
The authorities are also gathering biometric data and DNA. Two Uighurs, a former official and a student, said they were ordered to show up at police buildings where officers recorded their voices, took pictures of their heads at different angles and collected hair and blood samples.
The pressure on Uighur villages intensifies when party âwork teamsâ arrive and take up residence, sometimes living in local homes. The teams ask villagers to inform on relatives, friends and neighbors, and they investigate residentsâ attitudes and activities, according to government reports published online.
One account published last year described how the authorities in one village arranged for detainees accused of âreligious extremismâ to be denounced by their relatives at a public rally, and encouraged other families to report similar activities.
âMore and more people are coming forward with information,â Cao Lihai, an editor for a party journal, wrote in the report. âSome parents have personally brought in their children to give themselves up.â
A Uighur woman in her 20s who asked to be identified only by her surname, Gul, said she came under scrutiny after wearing an Islamic head wrap and reading books about religion and Uighur history. Local officials installed cameras at her familyâs door â and inside their living room.
âWe would always have to be careful what we said and what we did and what we read,â she said.
Every week, Ms. Gul added, a neighborhood official visited and spent at least two hours interrogating her. Eventually, the authorities sent her to a full-time re-education camp.
Ms. Gul, who fled China after being released, later tried to contact her brother to find out if he was in trouble. He sent a wordless reply, an emoticon face in tears.
Afterward, Ms. Gulâs mother sent her another message: âPlease donât call us again. We are in trouble.â
Broken Families
The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014, when the âderadicalizationâ push began.
Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.
âIt was of absolutely no use,â said Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, of his time held in a camp in 2017. âThe outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.â
For many families, the disappearance of a loved one into the camps can be devastating, both emotionally and economically â a point reflected in reports posted online by the partyâs âwork teams.â
Some of these reports describe Uighur families unable to harvest crops on their own because so many members have been taken away, and one mentioned a mother left to care for five children. In another report, an official near Hotan described holding a village meeting to calm distraught relatives of those sent to the camps.
The mass internments also break Uighur families by forcing members to disown their kin or by separating small children from their parents. So many parents have been detained in Kashgar, a city in western Xinjiang, that it has expanded boarding schools to take custody of older, âtroubledâ children.
âWhether consciously or unconsciously, authorities in Xinjiang have recognized the power of families as an alternative source of authority,â said Rian Thum, a professor at Loyola University in New Orleans who has followed the detentions. âThe kind of extreme party loyalty they want has no room for that.â
Ms. Gul said the camp she was in was ramshackle enough that children who lived nearby sometimes crept up to a window late at night and called out to their mothers inside. âTheir children would come and say, âMother, I miss you,ââ she said.
âWe didnât say anything,â she added, âbecause there was a camera inside the cell.â

The Peopleâs Republic of Cruelty,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2104699999?accountid=14586,"Every now and then, when credulous Western observers arenât fawning over Chinaâs high-speed rail network or calculating the precise moment when its economy will become the worldâs largest, a news story breaks through to remind us that the Peopleâs Republic remains what it has always been: a place of fear and cruelty. One such story, by the Timesâs Chris Buckley, is worth particular attention.
Writing from Hotan, a city in the western province of Xinjiang, Buckley describes a system of internment camps, brainwashing programs, and pervasive surveillance, all aimed at the regionâs Muslim majority, mostly ethnic Uighurs. The overall approach, he writes, is âreminiscent of Maoâs draconian rule â mass rallies, public confessions and âwork teamsâ assigned to ferret out dissent.â
As with so much in China, the scale is vast. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims have been hauled into re-education camps for weeks or months at a time, often indiscriminately, with no clear idea of when, or if, theyâll get out. The city itself âfeels as if under a siege by an invisible enemy,â with ubiquitous surveillance cameras, metal detectors, checkpoints, police outposts, biometric data collection, and local residents assigned to spy on their neighbors.
As with so much else in China, too, the government lies about what itâs doing. It flat-out denies the use of arbitrary detention, the targeting of an ethnic minority, or the existence of the re-education camps, which it described as job-training centers. That these denials are contradicted by the governmentâs own documents, some of them publicly available, is a useful reminder that repressive regimes are frequently incompetent, too.
A somewhat more accurate explanation for Beijingâs behavior is that it fears ethnic separatism and Islamic radicalism. Those fears arenât entirely misplaced: China has been the victim of terrorism, most notoriously when knife-wielding Uighur assailants killed 31 people and injured another 141 at a train station in Kunming in 2014. And Uighur separatism has been a thorn in Chinaâs side for decades.
But Chinaâs policy isnât really meant to curb Islamic radicalism or ethnic separatism. As Buckley notes in his article, the brute repressiveness of Chinaâs methods does much more to fuel than ease Uighur resentments. Chinese Muslims can also be detained by the authorities for praying, fasting, eating breakfast before sunrise, going to a mosque, not smoking, performing a traditional funeral, or telling others not to swear or sin.
None of this is evidence of extremism. Itâs evidence of ordinary decency and modest religiosity.
Yet it is for the same reason that Beijing has spent decades persecuting other religions or spiritual practices not typically associated with modern terrorism or separatism, like Protestantism and Falun Gong. The same was long true of the Catholic Church, at least until the Vatican capitulated to Beijing this week by tentatively agreeing to allow the Communist Party to nominate its bishops.
Put another way, what stokes Beijingâs fears and stirs its fury, whether in the streets of Hotan or the house churches of Shanghai, isnât political opposition in the ordinary sense. Itâs the concept of conscience. It is the thought that good and bad, virtue and vice, fall beyond the scope of the regimeâs rightful authority and are not things it gets to define for itself and its subjects. To render unto Caesar cannot mean rendering everything unto Caesar. There are things that cannot be surrendered â your soul, above all â no matter what the regimeâs power is to squash or suppress them.
Thatâs not to say that the regime canât try, which is what itâs doing in Xinjiang, not to mention Tibet and everywhere else it exercises control. The worst cruelties are those imposed in pursuit of elusive targets.
It is to say, however, that eventually the regime will fail. In the list of what ails China â slowing growth; corrupt officialdom; a declining birth rate; a trade war with the U.S.; Xi Jinpingâs cult of personality; the inherent disconnect between a politics of repression and the spirit of innovation â the regimeâs war on the soul doesnât usually rank high. But it matters most. It means the regime has made an enemy of the one thing it cannot kill, capture, eradicate or cure. At some point it will either have to abandon the struggle or destroy itself in the effort, much as the Soviet Union did.
Iâve written this column while making my way through The Atlanticâs superb October issue, with essays from Anne Applebaum, Yuval Noah Harari, David Frum, Amy Chua and others on the question, âIs Democracy Dying?â It makes for bracing reading, much of it convincing. We should all be worried about the health of democracy. We should all work to repair the tattered fabric of liberal culture.
Then again, is there a Chinese equivalent to The Atlantic, offering equally bracing analyses of the shortcomings of authoritarianism? That the answer to that question is so obvious â and its implications so far-reaching â should give champions of open societies confidence for the future.

Typhoon Mangkhut Leaves Ruin Where Surfing Gained Foothold in China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2110054631?accountid=14586,"XICHONG, China â One of the worldâs largest population centers was spared the worst when Typhoon Mangkhut swept through Hong Kong and the cities of the Pearl River Delta four days ago, but not this village in a remote peninsula that has become a destination for something still novel in China: surfing.
When the storm hit the village, called Xichong, it created sea surges that dismantled sea walls upon which dozens of small shops, cafes and guest cottages stood. Wind gusts that reached 100 miles per hour shredded scores of coniferous trees that studded the scenic, crescent-shaped cove facing the South China Sea.
A brick guardhouse where loudspeakers once warned surfers of dangerous conditions had toppled onto the beach from a bank overlooking the sea, still intact but its foundation washed away. A large chunk of pink wall â neon hues being the color of choice here â was hurled back to where the surf breaks on the beach, a reminder of the awesome power of a turbulent sea.
In a matter of hours, the typhoon destroyed a beachfront repurposed in recent years as a laid-back retreat from the urban bustle of Shenzhen, a center of global trade, investment and technology with 13 million residents.
âToo horrible to look at,â said Xia Bing, who owns concessions along a section of the beach that until Sunday included a cafe called Brother, changing facilities for swimmers and surfers, and a handful of bungalows for overnight guests â all now a twisted mangle of debris and broken branches. Accessories like air-conditioners and a television simply disappeared.
âIt was like this when we got back,â he said. âNothing left.â
Typhoon Mangkhut cut a far more catastrophic swath through the Philippines, where scores were killed in floods and landslides, but it also exacted a considerable toll in China. The storm hammered Hong Kong and Macau on Sunday morning, before moving into the mainland, where at least five people were killed, according to latest government figures cited by the state-run news agency Xinhua on Tuesday. One person is still missing.
In Shenzhen, which abuts Hong Kong, nearly 12,000 trees were knocked over in the city, according to municipal officials, and workers continued to clear roads and highways in the days following.
The recovery in Xichong â a two-hour drive east from Shenzhenâs city center, when fallen limbs have not blocked the roads â could take far longer.
Xichong lies within a national park at the end of the Dapeng Peninsula, which extends into the South China Sea. The areaâs remoteness and natural beauty are what began luring surfers and backpackers. Now, the beach is divided into four sections, all owned by the Xichong Beach Company, a private enterprise created to capitalize on a growing tourist market.
Surfing culture is still relatively new to China, but has begun to win adherents. Hainan, the island southwest of here that is known as the Chinese Hawaii, is the undisputed capital of Chinese surfing, with beaches like those at Riyue Bay hosting international competitions.
The surfing guide Magic Seaweed notes that in Guangdong Province, where Xichong is, âspots are few and far between,â but it goes on to explain that at Xichong and another beach nearby âgood longboard waves peel lazily down some rivermouth sculpted sandbars.â
Yang Xue, 28, owns a surfing school and hostel in Xichong called Offshore Wind. Admittedly biased, she said that in the summer the beach had âthe best waves in China.â The accommodations at Offshore Wind were not luxurious, though that is not what attracts people to Xichong.
âThe surf community in China is still really small,â a surfer who identified himself only as Jun wrote on Vice China, describing how he came to take up residence in Xichong. âItâs so small that every time I meet a new surfer, it turns out we already have, like, 20 to 30 mutual friends. That helps it feel like a real community. No one is aggressive in the water.â
He compared the mood here with Shenzhen, where âpeople are constantly overstimulated, staring at their phones on the subway, craning their necks downward to watch some imported soap opera.â
Ms. Yang employed 20 people. Many of them gathered again on Tuesday to help begin the arduous task of clearing debris. Chain saws buzzed through fallen limbs and trees, but repairing the damage to some of the buildings and the sea wall will be more difficult and expensive.
Most of those helping Tuesday were dressed for surfing â T-shirts and flip-flops â and the damp on their clothes made it clear that some had recently taken breaks from their work. Adversity had not seemed to affect the spirit of the place.
âItâs O.K.,â Ms. Yang said when offered condolences for the damage. âWe are still here.â
The damage extended the length of the beach, which remains closed to visitors, though locals still waded in and two fishermenâs boats came ashore as the sun set Tuesday, hauling a decent catch, including two large sea bass.
The shops here had no insurance, Ms. Yang and other owners said, so they are relying for assistance on the company that operates the beach concession or the local government.
Echo Huo, a worker at a new surf shop, moved here in April because she wanted to learn to surf. She previously worked at a cafe in Dali, far inland in Yunnan Province. She does not take lessons, but paddles out when off work. More seasoned surfers generously offer pointers.
Winds sheared off the shopâs corrugated roof, which in turn sliced into a neighboring shop. The exterior wall disappeared, leaving a precipitous drop from the bank to the sand below. Everything in and around the shop was virtually destroyed.
Chinaâs building codes and zoning laws are often so vaguely written and loosely enforced that they can cause confusion in the best of times. No one in the stormâs aftermath could say for certain whether the spot would â or could â be rebuilt the way it had been.
âWe donât know if they will let us rebuild or not,â she said. âWe havenât received any official notice from the company or the government yet.â
Asked what she would do in the meantime, she shrugged, while making it clear she had no plans to leave. âWe wait,â she said.

"Chinaâs Sea Control Is a Done Deal, âShort of War With the U.S.â","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2110934742?accountid=14586,"NEAR MISCHIEF REEF, South China Sea â As the United States Navy reconnaissance plane banked low near Mischief Reef in the South China Sea early this month, a Chinese warning crackled on the radio.
âU.S. military aircraft,â came the challenge, delivered in English in a harsh staccato. âYou have violated our China sovereignty and infringed on our security and our rights. You need to leave immediately and keep far out.â
Aboard the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, flying in what is widely considered to be international airspace, Lt. Dyanna Coughlin scanned a live camera feed showing the dramatic evolution of Mischief Reef.
Five years ago, this was mostly an arc of underwater atoll populated by tropical fish and turtles. Now Mischief Reef, which is off the Philippine coast but controlled by China, has been filled out and turned into a Chinese military base, complete with radar domes, shelters for surface-to-air missiles and a runway long enough for fighter jets. Six other nearby shoals have been similarly transformed by Chinese dredging.
âI mean, this is insane,â Lieutenant Coughlin said. âLook at all that crazy construction.â
A rare visit on board a United States Navy surveillance flight over the South China Sea pointed out how profoundly China has reshaped the security landscape across the region.
[ Our reporters are investigating Chinaâs growing influence around the world ]
The countryâs aggressive territorial claims and island militarization have put neighboring countries and the United States on the defensive, even as President Trumpâs administration is stepping up efforts to highlight Chinaâs controversial island-building campaign.
In congressional testimony before assuming his new post as head of the United States Indo-Pacific Command in May, Adm. Philip S. Davidson sounded a stark warning about Beijingâs power play in a sea through which roughly one-third of global maritime trade flows.
âIn short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,â Admiral Davidson said, an assessment that caused some consternation in the Pentagon.
How Beijing relates to its neighbors in the South China Sea could be a harbinger of its interactions elsewhere in the world. President Xi Jinping of China has held up the island-building effort as a prime example of âChina moving closer to center stageâ and standing âtall and firm in the East.â
In a June meeting with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Mr. Xi vowed that China âcannot lose even one inch of the territoryâ in the South China Sea, even though an international tribunal has dismissed Beijingâs expansive claims to the waterway.
The reality is that governments with overlapping territorial claims â representing Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei â lack the firepower to challenge China. The United States has long fashioned itself as a keeper of peace in the Western Pacific. But itâs a risky proposition to provoke conflict over a scattering of rocks in the South China Sea, analysts say.
âAs Chinaâs military power grows relative to the United States, and it will, questions will also grow regarding Americaâs ability to deter Beijingâs use of force in settling its unresolved territorial issues,â said Rear Adm. Michael McDevitt, who is now a senior fellow in strategic studies at the Center for Naval Analyses.
An unexpected encounter in the South China Sea could also set off an international incident. A 1.4-million-square-mile sea presents a kaleidoscope of shifting variables: hundreds of disputed shoals, thousands of fishing boats, coast guard vessels and warships and, increasingly, a collection of Chinese fortresses.
In late August, one of the Philippinesâ largest warships, a cast-off cutter from the United States Coast Guard, ran aground on Half Moon Shoal, an unoccupied maritime feature not far from Mischief Reef.
The Chinese, who also claim the shoal, sent vessels from nearby artificial islands, but the Philippines refused any help. After all, in 2012, the Chinese Coast Guard had muscled the Philippines off of Scarborough Shoal, a reef just 120 nautical miles from the main Philippine island of Luzon. Another incident in 1995 brought a Chinese flag to Mischief Reef, also well within what international maritime law considers a zone where the Philippines has sovereign rights.
Could somewhere like Half Moon Shoal be the next flash point in the South China Sea?
âA crisis at Half Moon was averted, but it has always been the risk with the South China Sea that a small incident in remote waters escalates into a much larger crisis through miscommunication or mishandling,â said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. âThatâs why this is all so dangerous. Itâs not just a pile of rocks that can be ignored.â
âLeave immediately!â
On the scratchy radio channel, the Chinese challenges kept on coming. Eight separate times during the mission this month, Chinese dispatchers queried the P-8A Poseidon. Twice, the Chinese accused the American military aircraft not just of veering close to what Beijing considered its airspace but also of violating its sovereignty.
âLeave immediately!â the Chinese warned over and over.
Cmdr. Chris Purcell, the American squadron commander, said such challenges have been routine during the four months he has flown missions over the South China Sea.
âWhat they want is for us to leave, and then they can say that we left because this is their sovereign territory,â he said. âItâs kind of their way to try to legitimize their claims, but we are clear that we are operating in international airspace and are not doing anything different from what weâve done for decades.â
In 2015, President Xi stood in the Rose Garden at the White House and promised that âthere is no intention to militarizeâ a collection of disputed reefs in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys.
But since then, Chinese dredgers have poured mountains of sand onto Mischief Reef and six other Chinese-controlled features in the Spratlys. China has added at least 3,200 acres of new land in the area, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Descending as low as 5,000 feet, the surveillance flight this month gave a birdâs-eye view of the Chinese construction.
On Subi Reef, a construction crane swung into action next to a shelter designed for surface-to-air missiles. There were barracks, bunkers and open hangars. At least 70 vessels, some warships, surrounded the island.
On Fiery Cross Reef, a complex of buildings with Chinese eaves was arrayed at the center of the reclaimed island, including an exhibition-style hall with an undulating roof. It looked like a typical newly built town in interior China â except for the radar domes that protruded like giant golf balls across the reef. A military-grade runway ran the length of the island, and army vehicles trundled across the tarmac. Antenna farms bristled.
âItâs impressive to see the Chinese building, given that this is the middle of the South China Sea and far away from anywhere, but the idea that this isnât militarized, thatâs clearly not the case,â Commander Purcell said. âItâs not hidden or anything. The intention, itâs there plain to see.â
In other spots, reclamation could also be seen on Vietnamese-controlled features, such as West London Reef, where workers dragged equipment past piles of sand. But dredging by Southeast Asian nations is scant compared with the Chinese effort.
In April, China for the first time deployed antiship and antiaircraft missiles on Mischief, Subi and Fiery Cross, American military officials said. The following month, a long-range bomber landed on Woody Island, another contested South China Sea islet.
A Pentagon report released in August said that with forward operating bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea, the Peopleâs Liberation Army was honing its âcapability to strike U.S. and allied forces and military bases in the western Pacific Ocean, including Guam.â
In response to the intensifying militarization of the South China Sea, the United States in May disinvited China from joining the biannual Rim of the Pacific naval exercise, the worldâs largest maritime warfare training, involving more than 20 navies.
âWe are prepared to support Chinaâs choices, if they promote long-term peace and prosperity,â Mr. Mattis said, explaining the snub. âYet Chinaâs policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness of our strategy.â
Projecting Power
For its part, Beijing claims the United States is the one militarizing the South China Sea. In addition to the routine surveillance flyovers, Mr. Trump has sent American warships more frequently to waters near Chinaâs man-made islands. These so-called freedom of navigation patrols, which occur worldwide, are meant to show the United Statesâ commitment to maritime free passage, Pentagon officials say.
The last such operation by the United States was in May, when two American warships sailed near the Paracels, another contested South China Sea archipelago. Beijing was irate.
âCertain people in the U.S. are staging a farce of a thief crying, âStop, thief!â â said Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman. âIt is self-evident to a keener eye who is militarizing the South China Sea.â
The United States says that it does not take any side in territorial disputes in the South China Sea. On its maps, China uses a so-called nine-dash line to scoop out most of the waterwayâs turf as its own. But international legal precedent is not on Chinaâs side when it comes to the dashed demarcation, a version of which was first used in the 1940s.
In 2016, an international tribunal dismissed Beijingâs nine-dash claim, judging that China has no historical rights to the South China Sea. The case was brought by the Philippines after Scarborough Shoal was commandeered by China in 2012, following a tense blockade.
The landmark ruling, however, has had no practical effect. Thatâs in large part because Rodrigo Duterte, who became president of the Philippines less than a month before the tribunal reached its decision, chose not to press the matter with Beijing. He declared China his new best friend and dismissed the United States as a has-been power.
But last month, Mr. Duterte took Beijing to task when a recording aired on the BBC from another P-8A Poseidon mission over the South China Sea demonstrated that Chinese dispatchers were taking a far more aggressive tone with Philippine aircraft than with American ones.
âI hope China would temper its behavior,â Mr. Duterte said. âYou cannot create an island and say the air above it is yours.â
Missed Opportunities
Perceptions of power â and Chinese reactions to these projections â have led some analysts to criticize President Barack Obama as having been too timid in countering China over what Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the former head of the United States Pacific Command, memorably called a âgreat wall of sandâ in the South China Sea.
Critics, for instance, have faulted the previous administration for not conducting more frequent freedom of navigation patrols.
âChinaâs militarization of the South China Sea has been a gradual process, with several phases where alternative actions by the U.S., as well as other countries, could have changed the course of history,â said Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu.
Chief among these moments, Mr. Vuving said, was Chinaâs takeover of Scarborough Shoal. The United States declined to back up the Philippines, a defense treaty ally, by sending Coast Guard vessels or warships to an area that international law has designated as within the Philippinesâ exclusive economic zone.
âSeeing U.S. commitment to its ally, Beijing might not have been as confident as it was with its island-building program,â Mr. Vuving said. âThe U.S. failure to support its ally in the Scarborough standoff also demonstrated to people like Duterte that he had no other option than to kowtow to China.â
With most of the Spratly military bases nearing completion by the end of the year, according to Pentagon assessments, the next question is whether â or more likely when â China will begin building on Scarborough. A Chinese base there would put the Peopleâs Liberation Army in easy striking distance of the Philippine capital, Manila.
From the American reconnaissance plane, Scarborough looked like a perfect diving retreat, a lazy triangle of reef sheltering turquoise waters. But Chinese Coast Guard vessels could be seen circling the shoal, and Philippine fishermen have complained about being prevented from accessing their traditional waters.
âDo you see any construction vessels around there?â Lieutenant Coughlin asked.
âNegative, maâam,â replied Lt. Joshua Grant, as he used a control stick to position the planeâs camera over Scarborough Shoal. âWeâll see if it changes next time.â

"In KFCâs China Ads, Nuggets Are Served With Patriotism","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2113903076?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â China began an audacious experiment four decades ago to inject free-market thinking into its rigid, Communist-controlled political system, beginning a process that would lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and create the worldâs second-largest economy.
And what better way to celebrate this accomplishment than with a bucket of fried chicken?
Last week, KFC introduced an advertising campaign in mainland China celebrating 40 years of âreform and opening up,â the catchphrase that defined the era. A two-minute TV spot that aired on state television showed two Chinese celebrities traveling back in time by railway, seeing streets filled with bicycles and bamboo scaffolding.
The actors are then jolted back into the present on a high-speed bullet train to sporting events that evoke the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and to young people using smartphones and cheering at pop music concerts. As the ad continues, it shows people carrying boxes and buckets of KFC, with one group of twentysomethings clinking chicken nuggets together as if toasting with champagne.
âWho would have thought that the past 40 years would bring so much change?â one of the stars, the 44-year-old actor Huang Bo, says to Lu Han, a 28-year-old Chinese heartthrob. The TV spot concludes with a voice-over âsalutingâ Chinaâs 40th anniversary of economic reform and a cheer of âGo, China!â
Then it touts KFCâs seasonal meal deals. They include a bucket proclaiming â40 years of reform and opening upâ that contains three chicken nuggets, three drinks, two wings, two meat pastries, two burgers and a box of popcorn chicken. Price: about $14.80.
Foreign companies in China rarely venture into the political realm in their advertising, but the ad comes at a potentially difficult time. The mounting trade war between the United States and China, a major market for American consumer brands, has strained the two countriesâ commercial ties.
So far there are no signs of a Chinese consumer boycott, which could damage the local economy as much as American companies. Still, the prospect makes it important for American brands to maintain a positive image. The ad was made with China Central Television, the state-run broadcaster and a pillar of Chinaâs propaganda machine.
âKFC can potentially capitalize on CCTVâs prestige and benefit in the Chinese market at the critical moment when there are increasing tensions between the U.S. and China,â said Hongmei Li, an associate professor of strategic communication at Miami University in Ohio and the author of the book âAdvertising and Consumer Culture in China.â
The ad has been greeted with a mix of amusement and cynicism in China, where consumers are increasingly marketing-savvy.
âIt makes me feel nostalgic,â Guo Yuhong, a 51-year-old retiree, said of the part of the advertisement set decades ago. âYou know it used to be very luxurious to eat KFC in the past?â
Others were less impressed.
âLook at the bright red color,â Wang Xuejing, a Beijing customer, said as she scrolled through a KFC banner ad tailored for WeChat, a popular Chinese social media platform. âItâs so plain, not modern at all.â
âVery tacky,â said her companion, Zheng Boyi, pointing to the gold lettering on the bucket they had shared.
âItâs China red,â Yang Donghe, a 17-year-old model, said with some hesitation about the campaignâs red-and-gold color scheme. âNot bad.â
It isnât as if patriotic advertising is unique to China. KFC has previously adopted American symbolism â complete with George Washington sculpted from mashed potatoes â to celebrate the Fourth of July.
KFC also appeals to patriotism in other countries.
But in China, American brands in particular have to be careful to avoid offending local sensibilities. KFC has been the subject of protests there in the past, especially during times of political tension with the United States. Public pressure forced Starbucks a decade ago to close an outlet in Beijingâs Forbidden City.
Few foreign companies have aligned themselves with overtly political events in China as KFC has done, but many of them emphasize Chinese values and traditions. Coca-Cola stressed the importance of family reunions during Chinese New Year, while companies like Adidas, Nike and Pepsi jumped to highlight Chinese pride during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. McDonaldâs made its Olympic jingle more specific: âIâm lovinâ it when China wins.â
Arriving in 1987, KFC was an early entrant among consumer brands after China opened up to foreign investment, and it won broad appeal in part by tailoring its menu to local tastes. Breakfast combos of fried dough sticks and soy milk are a hit, and meal deals also offer rice. Its fried chicken comes in local flavors, encrusted with salted egg yolk or Sichuan spices.
KFC now has more locations in China than in the United States, with more than 5,000 restaurants in more than 1,000 cities.
The brand has slipped in popularity in recent years, facing competition from higher-end foreign brands like Pizza Express, a British chain, as well as cheaper local upstarts like Zhen Gongfu, or Real Kung Fu in Chinese. Yum Brands, which owns the KFC brand in the United States, spun off its Yum China operation two years ago, and it is now a separate company.
Representatives of Yum China, which owns KFC stores in China, did not respond to requests for comment.
It is unclear whether the new ad campaign will gin up business for the restaurant chain, but some Chinese diners doubt it.
âI donât really care about the ad,â said Yu Peng, a 28-year-old customer. âIt wonât affect my decision of eating KFC or not, though. I care more about the price and quality.â

Will China Hack the U.S. Midterms?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https:// search.proquest.com/docview/2116466016?accountid=14586,"President Trump recently accused the Chinese of interfering in American politics ahead of the midterm elections. âThey do not want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade,â he said, addressing the United Nations Security Council. He provided no evidence, and appeared to be complaining mostly about retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese government, which may hurt constituencies that support him, and an advertorial touting U.S.-China trade in an Iowa newspaper.
In a speech to the Hudson Institute on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence doubled down on the accusation, arguing that China âhas initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections.â Neither the president nor the vice president charged China with stealing and releasing politically sensitive emails or manipulating social media, as the Russian government appears to have done to sway the 2016 presidential election.
And the Chinese government has not yet tried to use cyberspace to disrupt American elections, it seems. Yet the threat is real.
China has both the playbook and the capacity to interfere. Chinese entities operating with the assent of the government in Beijing already have mounted long-running cyberespionage campaigns against United States government agencies, the defense industry and American private companies. And they have conducted disruptive cyberattacks on political processes and social media campaigns in targets the Chinese government considers internal: Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
In 2012, during a wave of self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese repression, online discussions using the hashtag #FreeTibet were often drowned out by bots and fake Twitter accounts. It is difficult to tie Beijing directly to the bots, but there is good reason to suspect a connection given that government-supported hackers have targeted Tibetan activists and exiles before then and since.
During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a series of protests calling for more direct democracy in Hong Kong, Chinese hackers with suspected ties to intelligence agencies infected the devices of activists with spyware. They also conducted denial-of-service attacks on Apple Daily, a newspaper critical of Beijing, and on an academic website that was carrying out a civic referendum about expanding voting rights in Hong Kong.
Chinese hackers have often used Taiwan to test cyber espionage techniques that are later deployed against other targets, and they appear to being doing the same with online influence operations.
Beijing is suspected of being behind a disinformation campaign last year that claimed that the government of President Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan. was planning to strictly regulate Buddhist and Taoist temples and ban the burning of incense. The government denied having any such intentions, but temple owners from across the island held protests in Taipei, believing the fake policy announcement.
In July, the website of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party was hacked. Legislators from the party have complained about the proliferation of online trolling and fake news campaigns originating from China in the run-up to local elections â and ahead of Taiwanâs 2020 presidential race.
Seen from Beijingâs vantage point, these operations are responses to internal threats. And so far China doesnât seem to have intervened in another countryâs elections through online attacks.
Perhaps this is because it has other means of influence at its disposal. Money, political and academic exchanges, the mobilization of Chinese communities overseas, the expanding reach of state media â all have been effective ways of promoting Chinaâs interests abroad.
Compared with their Russian counterparts, Chinese intelligence officers historically have pursued their countryâs foreign policy objectives by cultivating long-term relationships rather than through disinformation. Russian operations tend to heighten political divisions to drive a wedge in the target society: Russia-linked bots pushed both pro- and anti-vaccination information in the United States between 2014 and 2017, and a Russian agency with ties to the Kremlin bought Facebook ads about divisive issues such as race, abortion and gender equality ahead of the 2016 election. Chinese operations aim instead to cultivate common interests with powerful actors.
Chinaâs and Russiaâs influence techniques differ because their strategic goals do. Both governments may want to weaken the United States and its alliances, but Beijing seems more intent than Moscow on bending institutions to meet its interests: Perhaps it hopes to supplant the current international order, but not by completely disrupting it. For example, Chinese officials have proposed new rules for governing cyberspace, arguing that each country should be able to regulate its internet, free of outside intervention.
In the past, Beijing has denied claims by the United States government and American cybersecurity firms that it uses the Ministry of State Security, the Peopleâs Liberation Army and private actors for cyber espionage. Anyway, there are no international agreements restricting such spying. Revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that American government agencies have also engaged in hacking only make Washingtonâs complaints seem hypocritical.
When Americans accuse the Russian government of meddling, it simply refutes the charges, with little concern about being believable, or anything other than its power relative to Washingtonâs. Getting caught using cyberattacks to disrupt an election would seriously undermine both Beijingâs narrative that it has an alternative but cooperative model of international governance to offer and its vision of itself as a rising power committed to not interfering in other countriesâ internal affairs.
Chinaâs continued restraint, however, is not guaranteed. Beijing has invested heavily in artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies that could boost its ability to manipulate information in the future. There is a growing pushback against all forms of Chinese influence in Australia, Europe, New Zealand and the United States.
In addition, the Chinese leadership increasingly believes that Washington is moving away from a strategy of engaging China toward a policy designed to contain its rise. The loss of traditional means of influence and a more conflictual relationship with liberal democracies may eventually convince Beijing that it stands to gain from resorting to more aggressive methods online.
If so, the tactics it has deployed in Taiwan may provide a model for any operations in the United States. For example, Chinese hackers could steal and release documents and emails from congressional staffers or State Department officials to, say, expose and embarrass supporters of closer relations with Taiwan or critics of Americaâs allies.
As it watches Washington struggle to find a coherent response to Russian interference in 2016, the Chinese government is likely to think that it could avoid serious repercussions if it ever launched similar cyberattacks in the United States. Were Chinaâs strategic calculations to change, there would be little to stop it from entering the online fray.

China and the Case of the Interpol Chief,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2117940420?accountid=14586,"China has yet to give any details of the corruption charges against Meng Hongwei, the president of Interpol, who disappeared on a visit home and was later said to have been arrested. Whatever the charges are, they are almost certainly not the real reason for his fate. In China, the law is what the Communist Party says it is â more precisely, what President Xi Jinping says it is. And when an official of Mr. Mengâs global stature is nabbed, itâs a political decision â even if, coincidentally, he was corrupt, as is often the case in China.
Mr. Meng understood the rules of that game. He had been a vice minister of public security in a police state and had played a role in many operations, including Operation Fox Hunt, which tried to bring Chinese officials and businesspeople suspected of corruption back from abroad. His former boss, Zhou Yongkang, was imprisoned for life on corruption charges in 2015. Mr. Mengâs last WhatsApp message to his wife was an emoji of a knife, which she understood to mean he was in danger.
Interpol has asked Beijing for an explanation for Mr. Mengâs detention but has taken no further action. The agency issued a statement on Sunday that it had accepted his resignation as president âwith immediate effectâ and named a replacement.
Whatever else he was, Mr. Meng was the president of Interpol, a venerable international organization based in France that facilitates cooperation among police forces from its 192 member countries. The position of president is largely ceremonial â a secretary general, currently JÃ¼rgen Stock of Germany, runs day-to-day operations. But the selection of a Chinese official for the post was a major feather in Chinaâs cap, proudly hailed by Mr. Xi a year ago as evidence that China âabided by international rules.â
The crude arrest of Mr. Meng proclaims the opposite. Chinaâs behavior puts it more closely in a league with Russia, another nation whose authoritarian leader is convinced that his country is due global respect and deference by virtue of its wealth and might, and not its actions. Itâs a perception seemingly shared by President Trump in his fondness for strong, unaccountable leaders and his America First approach to foreign policy.
Tellingly, both China and Russia have brazenly tried to use Interpol to pursue political foes. China put out a âred notice,â in effect a wanted alert, for Dolkun Isa, a self-exiled activist for the rights of Chinaâs beleaguered Uighur minority. Russia tried to use Interpol to catch Bill Browder, a hedge-fund manager turned anti-Vladimir Putin campaigner, among other political gadflies. In these cases, Interpol has properly refused to cooperate.
It is possible that Mr. Mengâs failure to pursue the Isa warrant fed Mr. Xiâs anger. According to The Economist, a Ministry of Public Security statement condemning Mr. Mengâs alleged wrongdoings also stressed the need for âabsolute loyaltyâ and for âresolute supportâ for the countryâs leader.
What Mr. Meng did to join the lengthening list of officials purged by Mr. Xi may never be fully known outside the Communist hierarchy. What is known, and deeply troubling, is how brazenly China is prepared to wage its internal power struggles without any regard for procedures, appearances or international norms.

Uighur Americans Speak Against Chinaâ s Internment Camps. Their Relatives Disappear.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2122803753?accountid=14586,"ROSSLYN, Va. â Speaking last month at a Washington think tank, Rushan Abbas relayed tales of suffering she had heard about Chinaâs repression of ethnic Uighur Muslims â including the detention of members of her husbandâs family in a widespread system of mass internment camps.
Within six days, Ms. Abbasâs ailing sister and 64-year-old aunt disappeared from their homes in northwest China. No family members or neighbors have heard from them in more than a month.
Ms. Abbas is an American citizen and Virginia resident; her sister has two daughters, and both live in the United States. They all assume the women are being detained in the camps, which Western analysts estimate hold up to one million people.
Ms. Abbas said they had fallen victim to the persecution against which she had been campaigning â and because of her.
âIâm exercising my rights under the U.S. Constitution as an American citizen,â Ms. Abbas, a business consultant, said from her 12th-floor office in Rosslyn, Va., overlooking the Key Bridge and Potomac River. âThey shouldnât punish my family members for this.â
âI hope the Chinese ambassador here reads this,â she added, wiping away tears. âI will not stop. I will be everywhere and speak on this at every event from now on.â
Ms. Abbas, 50, is among a growing number of Uighur Americans who have had family members detained by the Chinese police and placed in the anti-Islam camp system that is spread across the northwest region of Xinjiang. Chinese officials describe the internment as âtransformation through educationâ and âvocational education.â
The Washington area has the largest population of Uighurs in the United States, so stories like that of Ms. Abbas are now common here. Chinese officers aim to silence Uighurs abroad by detaining their family members.
But that tactic is backfiring. Although some Uighurs abroad are afraid to speak out for fear that relatives in Xinjiang will be detained, Ms. Abbas said, there are ones like her who are more willing to voice their outrage.
Those in Washington could sway United States policy toward China, at a time when officials are debating a much tougher stand on defending Uighurs. Some like Ms. Abbas have acquaintances at think tanks, including at the conservative Hudson Institute, where she spoke on Sept. 5, and in Congress and the White House. Ms. Abbas has also spoken to staff members at the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which is led by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey.
âHarassing the relatives of U.S. citizens is what Chairman Mao used to call dropping a rock on your own feet,â said Michael Pillsbury, director for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute, noting that repression of Uighurs would also erode relations between China and Muslim nations.
This month, a daughter of Ms. Abbasâs detained sister wrote to Mr. Rubio about her motherâs plight. The daughter, an American citizen, lives in Florida, Mr. Rubioâs home state. The other daughter, a legal permanent resident, lives in Maryland. Their mother, Gulshan Abbas, 56, has severe health problems.
Asked for comment about issues facing Uighur Americans, Mr. Rubio said, âThe long arm of the Chinese governmentâs domestic repression directly impacts the broader Uighur diaspora community, including in the United States.â
âThis is unacceptable, and it takes tremendous courage for these individuals to even come forward given the growing number of reports of Chinese government harassment, intimidation and threats aimed at the Chinese, Uighur and Tibetan diaspora communities living in the United States,â Mr. Rubio added.
Mr. Rubio is pushing legislation to compel the United States to take action on behalf of Uighurs. It says the F.B.I. and other government agencies âshould track and take steps to hold accountableâ Chinese officials who harass or threaten people from China who are American citizens or living or studying here, including Uighurs.
Separately, officials at the White House and the State and Treasury Departments are discussing imposing economic sanctions on Chinese officials, under the Global Magnitsky Act, who are involved in repression of Uighurs.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spoken about the plight of the Uighurs and the harassment of Uighur Americans. In April, the State Departmentâs chief spokeswoman met with Gulchehra Hoja, a Uighur American journalist for Radio Free Asia who said two dozen of her family members had been detained in Xinjiang. Ms. Hoja testified in July at the congressional commission.
In a China policy speech this month, Vice President Mike Pence denounced Chinaâs attempts to shape public opinion in the United States through coercion and other means.
Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said, âBeijingâs harassment now factors into whether citizens of countries like Australia and the United States feel safe enough to attend public discussions about Xinjiang at events ranging from congressional hearings in Washington or think tank talks in Sydney.â
âEnding abuses in Xinjiang now depends in part on ensuring that these communities are safe to exercise their rights around the world, and on governments following Germanyâs and Swedenâs lead and committing to not sending Uighur asylum seekers back to China,â she said.
Ferkat Jawdat, a Uighur and American citizen who lives in Chantilly, Va., last spoke to his mother in February. She was forced to stay in Xinjiang when he and his siblings came to the United States in 2011 because the Chinese authorities would not give her a passport. She told him in February that she feared she was going to be put in a camp; Mr. Jawdat has not been able to reach her since.
Representative Barbara Comstock, Republican of Virginia, pressed Mr. Jawdatâs case in an Oct. 3 letter to Chinaâs ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai. It asked why Mr. Jawdatâs missing mother, Minaiwaier Tuersun, âhas been imprisoned, why the Chinese government refused to issue her a passport in 2011, and when she will be released.â
There has been no response from the Chinese embassy, Mr. Jawdat said.
The youngest of four children of a prominent biologist and a doctor, Ms. Abbas grew up in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, and attended a university there. She has lived in the United States since May 1989, when she came as a visiting scholar to Washington State University. She got a masterâs degree in plant pathology there and became an American citizen in 1995.
Ms. Abbas has been active in Uighur issues for decades. She joined Radio Free Asia in Washington in 1998 as its first Uighur reporter before moving to California. She worked as an interpreter for the Defense Department when it detained 22 Uighurs in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, then helped with their relocations to other countries. She moved back to Washington in 2009 to be an advocate for Uighurs.
She said she waited one month before speaking to a journalist about the simultaneous disappearances of her sister and her aunt, Mayinur Abliz, in the hopes that officials would release them. Now she sees a dark future for them unless she speaks out.
She plans to mention them at a talk she is scheduled to give on Friday at Indiana University.
âChina needs to respect international laws,â Ms. Abbas said. âThis is so childish, what theyâre doing â taking hostage the family members of someone who left when she was 21.â

Being China Means Never Having to Say Youâre Sorry,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2124270059?accountid=14586,"Last month, the international law enforcement agency Interpol lost its chief, Meng Hongwei, and set out looking for him. It turns out that Mr. Meng, also a vice minister of public security in China, was arrested by Chinese security personnel upon returning to China (Interpol is headquartered in France). It took nearly two weeks to find out why: Partly in response to Interpolâs demands for information, the internal oversight organ of the Chinese Communist Party announced that Mr. Meng was under investigation for being âpossibly involved in illegal activities.â Interpol then received Mr. Mengâs resignation.
Mr. Mengâs trial may not take place for months, but the C.C.P. has essentially already announced its verdict. A lengthy but largely abstract diatribe by the C.C.P. committee of the Ministry of Public Safety explicitly accused Mr. Meng only of taking bribes. Far more incriminating was the implication that he was connected to Zhou Yongkang, a disgraced former member of the Politburoâs Standing Committee, âwhose pernicious influence must be resolutely and totally eradicated.â
Mr. Zhou is a known protÃ©gÃ© of the former party chief Jiang Zemin, who is thought to be the archenemy of President Xi Jinping, and it was when Mr. Zhou was minister of public security that Mr. Meng was promoted to his last position.
Promptly after Mr. Mengâs arrest, he was replaced by a former subordinate of Mr. Xiâs from when the president was the party chief in Fuzhou, a city in southeastern China.
And so the incident can simply be regarded as one more chapter in the ongoing power struggle at the senior-most levels of the C.C.P., between Mr. Xi and Mr. Jiang â or, as I put it recently, between the head of the Red Aristocrats and the leader of the Plebeians.
Still, people in the non-Chinese media ask, perplexed: Wasnât the disappearance of Mr. Meng a very clumsy and all-too-public way to dispense with an enemy? He was, after all, one of Chinaâs own leading law enforcement officials, who rose to that rank while Mr. Xi already was Chinaâs president and who was then sent to represent the country as the head of the worldâs top law enforcement organization. Is the Chinese government now saying it made a mistake in backing him? Isnât that a huge loss of face?
The answer is no.
In the pre-Confucian system, shame, or chi (æ¥), was said to be possessed only by the most courageous. Chi was so important that the statesman Guan Zhong (720-645 B.C.), later much acclaimed by Confucius, said it was one of the four moral foundations of a nation. But Confucianism has been co-opted by Chinaâs ruling class over time, and turned into dogma and tool of thought control. C hi , that inner sense of shame, has been debased to mean merely not having face. Who has face now? The rich and powerful.
China today is rich and powerful; therefore, it has face and simply cannot be embarrassed. The investigation of Mr. Meng, the public security ministry has said, âis very timely, totally right and very wise.â The foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said it showed that the government is determined to combat corruption and that there can be âno privilege or exception before the lawâ â and that âthe overwhelming majority of members of the international community will have correct views and conclusions about this.â Embarrassment is in the eyes of the beholder.
But then comes the more pragmatic question: Wonât the Meng incident jeopardize Chinaâs chances of placing more of its people at the head of international bodies in the future? The C.C.P. could have lured him back to China and packed him off under some pretext like poor health while silencing the rest of his family.
Mr. Xi may have assessed â and if so, quite correctly, I think â that given the souring of relations between China and the United States, in the future Beijing wonât have as many opportunities as before to see Chinese people lead major world organizations. That being so, riding roughshod over Mr. Meng wasnât costly internationally â on the other hand, it could cause shock and awe among Mr. Xiâs domestic opponents.
After seven decades of living under the Communists, the people of China know that during times of heightened international tensions, the leadership will demand unity at home and punish dissent. Many may even fall into line and wax nationalistic â creating a feedback loop that will only push Chinaâs leaders toward more extreme positions, internally and internationally.
The Nixon-Kissinger-Clinton thesis â that helping China develop its economy would bring about a middle class that would then push the country to democratize and become a responsible stakeholder internationally â is now widely recognized as wishful thinking. The reverse is proving true: For China today, having face means being shameless. And the rest of the world may just have to get used to that.

Campaign Contribution Raises Concerns About Chinaâs Meddling in New Zealand,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2126620604?accountid=14586,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand â The two politicians started their conversation casually, but there was serious business at hand: a donation recently deposited into a party account from a wealthy businessman, which one of the lawmakers said totaled 100,000 New Zealand dollars.
The reported size of the donation, about $66,000, was large by New Zealand standards. But the cash, the lawmaker says, came with strings attached â a promise to add the names of two businessmen to a list of candidates for Parliament â and a plan to disguise the identity of the donor, a man with deep pockets and well-documented connections to the Chinese Communist Party.
The conversation, a recording of which was leaked last week, is the latest in a series of scandals that suggest New Zealand is vulnerable to political interference at a time when China is seeking greater influence throughout the Pacific.
New Zealand is often portrayed as a progressive paradise far removed from the rest of the world, but it plays an important role in the Five Eyes network, an alliance of Western intelligence agencies assigned to listen in on communications worldwide. Similar concerns were raised last year when it was revealed that Jian Yang, a Chinese-born lawmaker and member of the National Party, had taught at a Chinese spy academy. Mr. Yang denied being a spy himself and remains in Parliament.
Analysts and allies fear that China can buy influence on the cheap and without raising alarms in New Zealandâs political system, which they say has weak rules about lobbying, by channeling money through small, anonymous donations.
Political donations, said Miguel Martin, a commentator who writes about China under the pseudonym Jichang Lulu, are an expedient way for the Communist Party to acquire âan avenue of influence on that countryâs policy.â
Others said politicians at the local and national levels and from every party are desperate for funding, and therefore potentially easy prey.
âThereâs kind of a âlet the good times rollâ aspect with politicians in New Zealand, where historically money has been hard to come by and parties â by global standards â donât have much of a budget at all,â said Rodney Jones, a New Zealand economist based in Beijing.
While contributions made directly from foreigners could raise red flags, Mr. Jones said, donations from some wealthy, Chinese-born New Zealanders with connections to the Chinese Communist Party are delivered to politicians âon a platter.â It is in the politiciansâ self-interest, he added, not to ask any too many questions about where the money originated.
The conversation leaked last week between the leader of New Zealandâs largest opposition party and a once-trusted lawmaker has prompted a national discussion about whether New Zealand should tighten its campaign finance rules, or introduce a registry of lobbyists like those in the United States and Australia.
Jami Lee Ross, a member of the center-right National Party, accused the partyâs leader, Simon Bridges, of fraud by trying to disguise a 100,000 New Zealand dollar donation as smaller, anonymous donations.
By law, the identities of contributors who donate less than 15,000 New Zealand dollars are allowed to remain anonymous.
Mr. Ross turned over to the police, and made public online, a phone call he had secretly taped with Mr. Bridges in June, in which the pair discussed a donation from the businessman, Yikun Zhang. The recording did not contain clear evidence that Mr. Bridges had asked for the donation to be broken up, and Mr. Bridges has denied doing so. The police are investigating whether the National Party failed to declare a donation from Mr. Zhang.
The National Party has said it did nothing illegal, but has yet to explain how the donation discussed in the call was handled.
The mention of Mr. Zhang piqued the interest of China analysts, who said the businessman had known ties to the Chinese Communist Party.
Mr. Zhang served in the Peopleâs Liberation Army and headed a provincial consultative group for the Communist Party before emigrating to New Zealand in 2000. His âentire life is in the shadow of the Communist Party,â said Chen Weijian, a member of the pro-democracy group New Zealand Values Alliance.
Mr. Zhang is chairman of the influential Chao Shan General Association of New Zealand, an organization started in 2014 for New Zealanders born in the Chinese town of Chaosan, but which has become an important intermediary between China and New Zealand. He plans to host 1,000 Chinese visitors at a business conference next year in Auckland, the countryâs largest city.
Mr. Zhangâs âpositions and relationshipsâ gave the Chinese Communist Party âleverage enabling it to âguideâ or simply expect individuals like Zhang to be aligned with the CCPâs policy goals,â said Mr. Martin.
Mr. Zhang has appeared in news photographs with both opposition lawmakers and those in the government, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
Ms. Ardern this week defended the electoral donation system, and said the countryâs politics were transparent and free from foreign interference.
Mr. Zhang has also attended a fund-raising auction for Phil Goff, the mayor of Auckland, and is currently traveling in China with another New Zealand mayor.
It is Mr. Zhangâs second trip to China with that mayor, Gary Tong of Southland.
Representatives for both the Labour and National parties did not respond to questions about whether they intended to investigate the foreign political connections of their donors, and the law does not require them to do so.
While politicians cannot accept large donations from foreigners, some analysts said lawmakers should be more savvy about where their money comes from.
Anne-Marie Brady, a Canterbury University professor who published a paper about what she called Chinaâs global blueprint for influencing Western democracies, told Radio New Zealand that the government should consider reforming rules around electoral finance, conflicts of interests, and âwhether itâs O.K. to be a member of a New Zealand political party and a foreign political party.â
(The New Zealand police and Interpol are investigating a burglary of Ms. Bradyâs home in February, which she believes was carried out by agents linked to Beijing.)
In the leaked recording between the two lawmakers, Mr. Ross reminds Mr. Bridges that he had also discussed with Mr. Zhang a potential political âcandidacyâ for two of his New Zealand-Chinese business associates. In New Zealand, some lawmakers campaign for seats representing a local constituency, while others are selected for Parliament by their political parties, and do not have to run for office.
âTwo MPs, yeah,â Mr. Bridges can be heard responding, in a reference to members of Parliament. Mr. Bridges said last week that he had not been promising candidates for cash.
China is New Zealandâs biggest trading partner and New Zealand is hoping to expand a free-trade agreement signed in 2008.
New Zealand is not the only country wrestling with issues of Chinaâs reach. Australia in June approved a sweeping national security law that, among other things, requires foreign lobbyists to register on a public list. New Zealand, on the other hand, does not require domestic or foreign lobbyists to register.
Australiaâs law was prompted by revelations that two businessmen of Chinese descent had donated millions across the political spectrum.
Mr. Ross, the lawmaker who released the recorded call, both resigned and was expelled from the National party last Tuesday, but maintained on Friday that he would remain in Parliament as New Zealandâs only independent lawmaker.
Soon after Mr. Ross levied his accusations, the website Newsroom published claims from six women who were former partners, employees or colleagues of Mr. Ross and said he had subjected them to bullying and intimidation over several years. Mr. Ross disputed those accounts, but admitted to having had affairs.
On Sunday, the local news media reported he had been admitted to a hospital for mental health treatment. He was discharged on Tuesday.

Lawmakers Push Trump to Act Against China on Uighur Detention,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2135212776?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â Lawmakers in Washington are trying to compel the Trump administration to take strong measures against Chinese officials for their mass repression of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in China.
Legislators introduced companion bills on Wednesday in the House and Senate following months of discussions on how to punish China for its treatment of the Uighurs, including sanctioning specific officials and limiting sales of products from American companies to certain Chinese state agencies. The push comes as Chinaâs treatment of the Uighurs has come under increasing scrutiny by Western news organizations and international agencies.
The bills would put more pressure on the Trump administration to take action on what international officials and scholars say is Chinaâs worst collective human rights abuse in decades. In Washington, administration officials are already starting to take a much harder line on China, including on trade, human rights and its military buildup in the Pacific.
Senior American officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, say Chinese officials are holding hundreds of thousands â and perhaps more than one million â Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims in internment camps across the northwest Central Asian border region of Xinjiang. Reports have emerged of torture, starvation and death in the camps, with officials forcing detainees to renounce standard Islamic practices and swear fealty to the Communist Party.
China has also set up a complex surveillance system using cameras, biometric data and phone apps in towns and cities across Xinjiang. And officials have mobilized more than one million Chinese civilians to occupy the homes of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang to indoctrinate and monitor them. Most of the civilians are ethnic Han, the dominant group in China.
Furthermore, Chinese officials are effectively holding hostage relatives of Uighurs who are abroad to force them to return to China to be detained or silence them about the human rights abuses.
But some Uighurs, including those in the United States, have been speaking out about the crisis. Uighurs in the Washington area with detained family members, including Rushan Abbas, a business consultant and former Defense Department interpreter, have met with officials and legislators and are pushing for the United States to take action.
The bills in Congress propose a wide range of measures and enjoy bipartisan support, increasing the likelihood that some form of the legislation could become law.
The legislation introduced Wednesday calls for the secretary of state to consider invoking the Global Magnitsky Act to impose economic sanctions on Chinese officials, including Chen Quanguo, the party chief in Xinjiang, engaged in the abuse. Officials in the White House and departments of State and Treasury have already been discussing this punishment.
The bills also ask the commerce secretary to consider prohibiting the sale or provision of any American-made goods or services to state agencies in Xinjiang. This measure is intended to prevent the sale of technology that might end up being used in the surveillance system or in the camps.
The bills would compel the director of national intelligence to report on the regional security threat resulting from the crackdown and on whether Central Asian and Southeast Asian nations are forcibly returning Turkic Muslim refugees and asylum seekers to China. And it asks the F.B.I. to report on Chinese state harassment of United States citizens, permanent residents and ethnic Uighurs or other Chinese nationals studying or working in the United States.
âThe president needs to have a clear and consistent approach to China, and not turn a blind eye as a million Muslims are unjustly imprisoned and forced into labor camps by an autocratic regime,â said Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
In the Senate, Mr. Menendez introduced the bill with Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who is chair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China. Fifteen senators signed the bill â seven Republicans, seven Democrats and one independent. Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey and a commission chairman, introduced the House version of the bill.
Mr. Rubio has been the most outspoken legislator on the Uighur issue. In July, the commission listened to testimony on the repression and heard from Gulchehra Hoja, a Uighur-American journalist for Radio Free Asia who said two dozen of her family members in Xinjiang have gone missing. Ms. Abbas and other Uighurs have also spoken to aides or members of the commission.
Adding to the pressure, 15 ambassadors in Beijing from Western nations sent a letter to Xinjiangâs Communist Party leader, Chen Quanguo, to have him explain alleged rights abuses against ethnic Uighurs, Reuters reported Thursday. Canadaâs ambassador is leading the effort, which also includes envoys from Britain, Germany and Scandinavian countries, but not from the United States.
Chinese officials say the internment camps are set up for vocational training or for the eradication of Islamic extremism. On Monday, United Nations human rights officials sent a letter to China condemning recent regulations that justified the establishment of the camps, saying those violated international law.
Last Friday, Mr. Pompeo said he had raised the issue of religious repression â including specifically the mass detention of Muslims â with top Chinese officials at a meeting in Washington.

The Dangerous NaÃ¯vetÃ© of Trump and Xi,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login. ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2135212845?accountid=14586,"Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are a bit alike, and that presents a danger to the global order.
The American and Chinese leaders are both impetuous, authoritarian and overconfident nationalists, and each appears to underestimate the other sideâs capacity to inflict pain. This dangerous symmetry leaves the two sides hurtling toward each other.
The 10 percent tariffs already imposed in the trade war are scheduled to rise to 25 percent in January, but thereâs also a broader confrontation emerging.
Trump and Xi may well be able to reach a cease-fire in their trade war when they meet for the Group of 20 in two weeks. Even if a deal is reached, though, it may be only a temporary respite that doesnât alter the dynamic of two great nations increasingly on a collision course.
Each side miscalculates by seeing the other as likely to give in. China perceives a wild man in the White House who talks big but who ultimately climbed down off his high horse on trade with Europe. Beijing doesnât seem to realize that Trumpâs challenge to China arises from core beliefs and reflects a broad disillusionment with China in the United States.
Iâm an example of that. I studied Chinese and lived for five years in China; my wife and I wrote a largely upbeat book about the countryâs prospects called âChina Wakes.â But Xi has damaged Chinaâs brand just as Trump has damaged Americaâs, and today itâs hard to find either Democrats or Republicans eager to speak up for China.
For its part, Washington misjudges as well. It sees Chinaâs economy as vulnerable and doesnât appreciate that China can wage a trade war with weapons other than tariffs. It can play a nationalism card so that it becomes unpatriotic for Chinese citizens to buy McDonaldâs burgers, drink Coke or wear Nike shoes. Safety inspections can close American hotels; tax investigations can tie American firms in knots; and customs delays can hold up parts and idle American-owned factories.
Chinese tourism to the U.S. can slow, students can be directed to Australian universities over American ones and rare earth minerals needed by American companies may develop shortages. China can further ease sanctions on North Korea, buy more oil from Iran or become more aggressive in the South China Sea. It can cancel Chinese trademarks owned by Ivanka Trump â that might get the presidentâs attention â and it can dump U.S. Treasury bonds.
Trump is right (I canât believe I just wrote those three words!) that China has not played fair. The best response would have been to work with allies to pressure China simultaneously from all sides; instead, Trump antagonized allies so that we are fighting this battle alone.
Why have I and so many others soured on China?
This is larger than Trump and Xi. Chinaâs admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 was meant to integrate the country into the global trading system as an increasingly responsible world power. But after moving mostly in the right direction under Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, China stalled under Hu Jintao and has moved backward under Xi.
China has stolen technology and intellectual property even as it has become more aggressive militarily in the South China Sea and curbed freedom at home. Xi offends global values by detaining more than one million Muslims in the Xinjiang region, arresting lawyers and Christians, and steadily squeezing out space for free thought. I used to report from China each year but now find the limits on a journalist visa so onerous that itâs not worthwhile. And Iâm supposed to be the lao pengyou, or old friend, of China.
There are other grounds for American concern about Chinaâs irresponsibility that havenât received much attention: I estimate that around 20,000 Americans die each year from overdoses of drugs originating from traffickers in China. In particular, two-thirds or more of America's fentanyl, a synthetic opioid far more lethal than heroin, appears to come from China.
In fairness, China has made some efforts to crack down on the drug trade, but this hasnât been a priority so long as the traffickers mostly export their fentanyl rather than sell it at home. If the Chinese government pursued drug smugglers the way it crushes dissident Christians, labor activists, lawyers or feminists, those drug exports would end.
Americaâs business executives used to be strong supporters of a pro-China policy, but they, too, have cooled. Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, has long been a vigorous advocate of close ties with China, so I was struck by a sober warning he gave to the Asia Society in New York the other day.
âEconomic tensions are reaching a breaking point,â Paulson cautioned in his speech. He concluded, and I think heâs right, that if the U.S. and China donât resolve their problems, the world will face âa systemic risk of monumental proportions.â

Specter of Meddling by Beijing Looms Over Taiwanâs Elections,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2137008972?accountid=14586,"TAIPEI, Taiwan â As Taiwan prepares to hold local elections on Saturday, concerns are growing that Beijingâs long effort to sway the islandâs politics has been armed with a new weapon: a Russia-style influence campaign.
The islandâs elections for city mayors and county and village leaders will in part serve as a report card on President Tsai Ing-wen, whose administration has come under immense pressure from Beijing. But Taiwan officials are sounding alarms at what they say is a campaign by Beijing to spread disinformation that serves its agenda by exploiting the islandâs freewheeling public discourse.
âThere are those people who mistakenly think that if you simply shout falsehoods loudly, theyâll become real,â Ms. Tsai wrote on Facebook last week. âWe must not let them succeed.â
Taiwan officials say the population of 23 million is regularly fed misleading information in the news media and on social networks that range from unverified footage of large-scale Chinese military drills to false reports of stranded travelers being abandoned by the islandâs government.
The onslaught of misinformation seems aimed at undermining the Tsai administration and her governing Democratic Progressive Party, which that leans toward independence, while helping politicians deemed more sympathetic to Beijing and unification who are typically with the opposition Kuomintang.
Chinaâs ruling Communist Party considers Taiwan part of its territory, and wants to bring the democratic island under its control. Ms. Tsai became president in May 2016 and has refused to meet Chinaâs demand that she endorse Beijingâs so-called One China principle, which holds that the mainland and the island are part of a single country.
In response, Beijing has sought to isolate Taiwan by drawing away its diplomatic allies, pressuring companies to erase references to Taiwan as a separate country and stepping up military drills.
The Taiwan authorities say they suspect that Beijing is also illegally funneling money to political campaigns through Taiwan businesses in mainland China. Late last month, the government said that it was building cases against candidates who were being funded by Beijing and that it had shut down two underground money exchanges through which funds earmarked for influencing the election had been flowing.
Taiwanâs government fears the use of social media misinformation campaigns are a new front for meddling.
Beijing denies engaging in any kind of interference in Taiwan.
A spokesman for Chinaâs Taiwan Affairs Office, Ma Xiaoguang, described Ms. Tsaiâs Facebook comments as âfake newsâ and ânot even worth refuting.â
Mr. Ma said wider allegations about meddling were âcompletely fabricated out of thin air. We hope our Taiwanese compatriots wonât believe it.â
But the propaganda war goes back seven decades, with attacks originating from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Many years after the Kuomintang government fled to the island after its defeat by the Communists in 1949, each side continued sending the other balloons carrying propaganda. They filled the airwaves with propaganda in slogans, news and music.
In 1996, by which time the Kuomintang had effectively given up its claim on the mainland, China fired missiles toward Taiwan in the days before the islandâs first democratic presidential election in an attempt to intimidate voters from casting ballots for the democratic reformer Lee Teng-hui. But the effort backfired, and Mr. Lee won a resounding victory.
Taiwan leaders say the propaganda is now carried over the strait through posts on Facebook, the chat app Line and a popular online bulletin board known as P.T.T.
In September, P.T.T. drew scrutiny for carrying a widely shared post that claimed that Taiwanese travelers stranded in Japan were being rescued by buses sent by Chinaâs consulate â but only on the condition that they declared themselves Chinese. The post, which was carried by Chinese media, led to criticism from the Taiwanese public that their government had failed them.
Su Chii-Cherng, Taiwanâs top diplomat in Osaka, Japan, killed himself, leaving a note saying that the ânewsâ had been troubling him. Witnesses from the Japanese airport later refuted the news, while P.T.T. users traced the original post to an IP address in Beijing.
Concerns about Chinese meddling have grown as the election race heats up. Of particular concern to Ms. Tsai and her party is the mayoral race in the southern city of Kaohsiung, where Han Kuo-yu, a Kuomintang candidate, has enjoyed a surprising surge in popularity. Mr. Hanâs victory would end two decades of D.P.P. control of the city, and be a significant setback for Ms. Tsai.
In October, lawyers for Chen Chi-mai, the D.P.P. candidate originally seen as a shoo-in for Kaohsiung mayor, told reporters they had evidence that misinformation defaming Mr. Chen that had spread widely on Taiwanese social media had originated from overseas accounts, including some with mainland IP addresses.
Mr. Han seemed unfazed by the prospect of outside interference in the political process. He directly addressed the authors of the posts, saying: âI donât know you, but I thank you.â It is unclear what, if any, public position his party has on the question of election meddling.
Itâs difficult to determine exactly how much influence Beijing is having on the Kaohsiung race. Nathan Batto, who has been following Taiwan elections since the 1990s, said that is because discussions often take place in closed, private groups.
âItâs hard for us to look in from the outside and see exactly how much there is and exactly how much influence itâs having,â said Mr. Batto, an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica, Taiwanâs most distinguished scholarly society. âWe have some sort of fuzzy idea that theyâre helping Han Kuo-yu in Kaohsiung quite a bit â but I donât know if thatâs why heâs surged in the polls or not.â
Part of Taiwanâs challenge, experts say, lies with weak media literacy and a hypercompetitive news industry that sometimes compromises editorial standards in the race for traffic.
A recent research report by the University of Oxford and the Reuters Institute noted that posts on social media accounts run by Chinaâs Peopleâs Liberation Army were picked up widely this year by Taiwan news outlets, which ran photographs and video from the militaryâs accounts without checking their veracity.
Danielle Cave, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Instituteâs International Cyber Policy Center, said that Taiwanâs government should work harder to raise public awareness of covert influence operations.
âItâs hard to see the Taiwanese government being able to successfully counter such operations if most citizens donât actually understand whatâs going on,â she said.

Will Taiwan Be the First Domino to Fall to China?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2138667124?accountid=14586,"Democratic countries that worry about the Chinese governmentâs attempts to influence their politics should study its success in this weekendâs elections in Taiwan.
The many races â for some 11,000 positions in villages, towns and counties across the island â were something like midterms and widely seen as a prelude to the next presidential election, scheduled for early 2020. By my count, candidates friendly to Beijing will now occupy 16 of the 24 top posts that were contested, up from the current six.
China has denied any meddling. But in the last several years, it has intensified its efforts to destabilize the Taiwanese government led by the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (D.P.P.). It has curbed tourism from the mainland, conducted military maneuvers around Taiwan and even threatened to invade.
How quickly the tide seems to have turned. In 2016, the D.P.P. had swept into power promising to set stronger safeguards against encroachment by the Chinese government even as it would develop Taiwanâs economic relations with China to improve its performance. The party won both the presidency and a solid majority in the national legislature â advances that seemed likely to radically set back Chinaâs growing ambitions on the island.
That D.P.P. victory followed the astounding Sunflower Movement of 2014, in which students, mostly, occupied the legislature to block the ratification of a trade treaty with China. The deal, negotiated by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, of the Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwanâs main pro-unification party, would have allowed Chinese capital easy entry into Taiwanâs service sector, and the protesters feared that it endangered what little remained of Taiwanâs economic independence. Their sit-in succeeded and the treaty was derailed.
But China wouldnât take no for an answer. And apparently it was correct not to: On Saturday night, even before all the election results were in, President Tsai Ing-wen resigned as the head of the D.P.P.
In part, her partyâs losses were the result of her courageous efforts to tackle much-needed but politically costly reforms â such as a plan to phase out a n exorbitantly expensive pension program for civil servants. She also opposed nuclear power, a proposition that is unpopular with Taiwanâs powerful high-tech manufacturers, whose factories depend on a stable electricity supply.
But the D.P.P.âs defeat also reveals Beijingâs increasing reach into Taiwan and, more specifically, its ability to exploit the weaknesses of an open society: namely, openness itself.
In the summer of 2014, I visited Port Keelung, a naval base in northeast Taiwan. Not far from the piers was National Taiwan Ocean University, which, among other things, trains naval officers. In its huge student center, I saw stacks of free newsletters published by the universityâs association of students from China. The contents were subtly political, with Beijingâs pro-unification line buried in human-interest stories or slick-looking entertainment. I asked a student if he was worried that Beijing was making inroads with such propaganda. He looked puzzled and said, âWell, you know, we are a free country, and these publications are legal.â
By now, according to the research institute of NHK, Japanâs national broadcaster, influential media conglomerates in Taiwan have become pro-Beijing; their major shareholders have been given greater business opportunities in Chinaâs vast market. Major Taiwanese newspapers and TV stations regularly feature content that hardly differs from that in China or routinely heap praise on Chinese leaders.
In March 2013, the Taiwanese newspaper China Times described Liu Yandong, a vice premier who once headed the Chinese Communist Partyâs vast influence machine, as one of âthree golden flowers among new leaders.â In March this year, it ran an opinion piece setting out a convoluted argument for why unlimited terms were a good thing for a good leader such as President Xi Jinping of China. Other examples abound.
James Moriarty, the chairman of the board of trustees of the American Institute in Taiwan, gave an interview to the pro-Beijing local media Television Broadcasts Satellite earlier this month, in which he warned that external forces might spread fake information to manipulate public opinion ahead of the vote. The interview was aired once and promptly deleted from the channelâs website.
The government in Beijing also knows that money talks with Taiwanese workers, including younger workers, who have faced a stagnation in real wages since manufacturing jobs â especially higher-paying ones in high-tech industries â started moving to China when it opened up its economy in the 1980s. Soon after the Sunflower Movement, Beijing began offering subsidies and preferential treatment to young Taiwanese who would go to China to work or to establish start-ups.
But it is among Taiwanâs political parties that China seems to have had most success. In just two decades, the KMT, once the staunchly anticommunist party of Chiang Kai-shek, has evolved into a deeply pro-Beijing party: It has even advocated Taiwanâs reunification with the mainland, essentially on Chinaâs terms. Just this month, Mr. Ma, who long counted as a moderate within the KMT, switched from once standing for âno unification, no independence and no use of forceâ to now saying that he was ânot against unification.â
Many Taiwanese say they regard themselves as only Taiwanese; just a tiny minority call themselves Chinese. And with the KMT now on the ascendancy, China may feel less need to consider a military invasion. But these factors also suggest that there will be even greater Chinese infiltration in Taiwan in the future.
If Taiwan falls and is absorbed into China, Hong Kong â which is already fast losing the autonomy that Beijing promised it during the handover in 1997 â could be next. It could become just another Chinese city well before its privileged status is set to expire in 2047. The Chinese government might then tap or pressure the global Chinese diaspora even more than it has so far. In particular, it could more easily manipulate migrants (or their descendants) who moved to the West from Taiwan or Hong Kong after China became communist in 1949, for example, by applying pressure on any of their relatives still living in Taiwan or Hong Kong.
After World War II, capitalist democracies feared that countries throughout Asia would fall to communism one by one. The domino theory didnât materialize, partly because of those democraciesâ vigilance. They would do well to stay on their guard today or else they may finally see the theory realized â by China, starting with Taiwan.

Mind Control in China Has a Very Long History,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2139173079?accountid=14586,"MELBOURNE, Australia â China has built a vast network of extrajudicial internment camps in the western region of Xinjiang, where Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are made to renounce their culture and religion, and are forcibly subjected to political indoctrination. After long denying the campsâ existence, the government now calls them benign training centers that teach law, Mandarin and vocational skills â a claim that has been exposed as a disingenuous euphemism and an attempt to deflect criticism for gross human rights abuses.
But the camps, especially their ambition to rewire people, reveal a familiar logic that has long defined the Chinese stateâs relationship with its public: a paternalistic approach that pathologizes deviant thought and behavior, and then tries to forcefully transform them. The scale and pace of the governmentâs campaign in Xinjiang today may be extraordinary, but the practice and its methods are not.
As far back as the third century BCE, the philosopher Xunzi argued that humanity was like âcrooked timberâ and that an individualâs character flaws needed to be scraped away or straightened out in the pursuit of social harmony. Mencius, a rival thinker, believed for his part in the innate goodness of human beings, but he too stressed the importance of self-improvement.
In stark contrast to Western liberalism, Confucianism â and Chinese political culture more broadly â hinges not on individual rights, but on the acceptance of social hierarchy and the belief that humans are perfectible. In Chinese thought, humans are not equally endowed; they vary in suzhi (ç´ è´¨), or quality. A poor Uighur farmer in southern Xinjiang, for example, sits at the bottom of the evolutionary ladder; an official from the ethnic Han majority is toward the top.
But individuals are malleable, and if suzhi partly is innate, it is also the product of oneâs physical environment and upbringing. Just as the wrong environment can be corrupting, the right one can be transformative. Hence the importance of following the guidance of people deemed to possess higher suzhi â the people Confucius called âsuperior personsâ (åå­) and the Communists now call âleading cadresâ (é¢å¯¼å¹²é¨).
So even a lowly Uighur farmer can improve her suzhi â through education, training, physical fitness or, perhaps, migration. And it is the moral responsibility of an enlightened and benevolent government to actively help its subjects improve or, as the China scholar Delia Lin puts it, to reshape âoriginally defective persons into fully developed, competent and responsible citizens.â During its seven decades in power, the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) has repeatedly tried to remold recalcitrant students, political opponents, prostitutes and peasants alike.
During the many centuries of imperial China, the family was the incubator of social order, with fathers guiding their sons and husbands guiding their wives according to a rigid set of rituals. If the family was in harmony, the entire community could be, too. On the other hand, any misdeeds could be punished with beatings, servitude, exile or death by strangulation, decapitation or slicing.
Today, the transformative logic of ganhua (æå) â the reformation of vile character traits through examples of moral superiority â underpins Chinaâs education system, incarceration theory and even the work of the United Front, the C.C.P.âs shadowy influence machine, whose agents try to court or co-opt nonparty members and Chinese living overseas.
For example, inmates often are isolated when they first arrive in prison and then are gradually reintegrated into the group. They are slowly coerced into obeying prison personnel, thug-like cell bosses and reformed prisoners. Various tactics are deployed to that end, both inducements (more food, sleep or human contact) and punishments (deprivation, torture, ostracization). The experience of shame, guilt, remorse and confession is supposed to bring about the prisonersâ conversion and renewal. This process is intentionally destructive: It is, the contemporary philosopher Tu Weiming has explained, a necessary journey of âpain and sufferingâ in the pursuit of human improvement.
In theory, the harshness of the process was supposed to be tempered by the voluntary desire to improve oneself and by the expression of empathy toward people who fell short. But C.C.P. apparatchiks, in their pursuit of authoritarianism, have sidelined those mitigating factors. Their forging efforts have largely relied on coercion rather than moral persuasion, and their often ruthless methods have killed tens of millions of Chinese citizens over the years.
Many of the people the C.C.P. has tried to reform were subjected to âadministrative sanctionâ (è¡æ¿å¤ç½) rather than criminal proceedings and placed in camps where they underwent âre-education through laborâ ( laojiao , å³æ). The laojiao system was formally abolished in 2013 after it was criticized for violating individual rights, yet re-education continues today â and not only in Xinjiang â under the guise of compulsory legal and moral training or tutelage. Both the ordinary and the famous can be subjected to it, often against their will and without legal recourse.
In 2014, the actor Huang Haibo underwent six months of âcustody and educationâ after he solicited a prostitute. The star actress Fan Bingbing disappeared for several months this year â then publicly confessed that she had committed tax fraud and praised the C.C.P.
Itâs a grass-roots effort, too. In the name of ârural revitalization,â C.C.P. officials in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang are calling for âthe standardization of peasant thought and behavior.â The program is just one part of a national, three-year action plan by the partyâs Central Committee âto raise the ideological and moral suzhi of Chinese peasants in order to refresh and revise their simple and honest character.â
When applied in Xinjiang, Tibet or other borderlands, ganhua seems to amount to a âcivilizing project,â as the anthropologist Stevan Harrell has said, which aims to create a uniform populace under the banner of a single âChinese nationâ (ä¸­åæ°æ). But it is more than that. In the 1960s, the psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton called Chinese-style thought control â with its dogmatic belief in absolute truth and compulsion to mend the incorrigible â âideological totalism.â
As Lifton noted, ideological totalism in China is not a continuous process, but a cyclical phenomenon. It elicits a mix of emotions. Some subjects comply, others withdraw; a few may even be enthusiastic at first. But over time the suffocating nature of repression also tends to breed resentment and resistance, and those in turn can bring about even more repressive methods of control.
During the Maoist era, various reformation campaigns petered out as both detainees and their overseers suffered from hunger and exhaustion. One wave of repression would abate but then another would appear, with a different target: The so-called rightists who were released in 1959 on Maoâs orders were labeled counter-revolutionaries and hounded just a few years later, during the Cultural Revolution.
Starting in the 1980s, Deng Xiaopingâs agenda of economic reform helped return Chinese society to a more even and pragmatic keel â at least until the Tiananmen crackdown. But now President Xi Jinping seems to be intensifying repression again â against ethnic minorities, intellectuals, lawyers, Christians, labor activists, even Maoist students.
Yet ideological totalism seems to contain the seeds of its own destruction. It is costly. It encourages abuses of power by local party officials, who reap rewards for maintaining stability. Those abuses undermine both the rule of law and social trust.
Over time, ideological totalism risks corroding the stateâs legitimacy. And âonce the public begins to lose trust in the government and ceases to identify with it,â the Chinese scholar Yu Jianrong has written, âpanic sets in and complete social chaos is unleashed.â
It is the regimeâs fundamental insecurity â the fear of rebellion and eventually Chinaâs dismemberment â that drives it deeper and deeper into the private lives of its citizens, only alienating them. The repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang is just the extreme manifestation of the C.C.P.âs virulent â and unsustainable â pursuit of total control.

"After a Hiatus, China Accelerates Cyberspying Efforts to Obtain U.S. Technology","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2139177929?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â Three years ago, President Barack Obama struck a deal with China that few thought was possible: President Xi Jinping agreed to end his nationâs yearslong practice of breaking into the computer systems of American companies, military contractors and government agencies to obtain designs, technology and corporate secrets, usually on behalf of Chinaâs state-owned firms.
The pact was celebrated by the Obama administration as one of the first arms-control agreements for cyberspace â and for 18 months or so, the number of Chinese attacks plummeted. But the victory was fleeting.
Soon after President Trump took office, Chinaâs cyberespionage picked up again and, according to intelligence officials and analysts, accelerated in the last year as trade conflicts and other tensions began to poison relations between the worldâs two largest economies.
The nature of Chinaâs espionage has also changed. The hackers of the Peopleâs Liberation Army â whose famed Unit 61398 tore through American companies until its operations from a base in Shanghai were exposed in 2013 â were forced to stand down, some of them indicted by the United States. But now, the officials and analysts say, they have begun to be replaced by stealthier operatives in the countryâs intelligence agencies.
The new operatives have intensified their focus on Americaâs commercial and industrial prowess, and on technologies that the Chinese believe can give them a military advantage.
That, in turn, has prompted a flurry of criminal cases, including the extraordinary arrest and extradition from Belgium of a Chinese intelligence official in October. Trump administration officials said the arrest reflected a more determined counterattack against a threat that has infuriated some of the countryâs most powerful corporations.
âWe have certainly seen the behavior change over the past year,â said Rob Joyce, Mr. Trumpâs former White House cybercoordinator, speaking at the Aspen Cyber Summit in San Francisco this month.
Mr. Trump and administration officials often suggest that all technology-acquisition efforts by China amount to theft. In doing so, they are blurring the line between stealing technology and negotiated deals in which corporations agree to transfer technology to Chinese manufacturing or marketing partners in return for access to Chinaâs market â a practice American companies often view as a form of corporate blackmail but one distinct from outright theft.
The stealing of industrial designs and intellectual property â from blueprints for power plants or high-efficiency solar panels, or the F-35 fighter jet â is a long-running problem. The United States trade representative published a report this month detailing old and new examples. But the administration has never said whether cracking down on theft and cyberattacks is part of the negotiations or simply a demand that China cease activity that Beijing has already acknowledged, in the Obama years, was illegitimate.
But as Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi prepare to meet at the Group of 20 gathering in Argentina this weekend, Chinaâs corporate espionage has once again emerged as a core American grievance.
Whatever the reason for the renewed hacking, it is a cautionary tale as Mr. Trump tries to use tariffs and threats of more restrictions to strike a new trade deal with Mr. Xi, one that presumably would address, once again, the Chinese practices that Mr. Obama thought he had halted.
American trade and intelligence officials, as well as experts from private cybersecurity firms, all acknowledged that the previous agreement had completely fallen apart.
And that, they agreed, has made it still more difficult to imagine how any new agreement struck between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would become a permanent solution to a problem that reaches back years, and seems rooted in completely different views of what constitutes reasonable competition.
âOur two systems are so dissimilar that I think there was never real hope that crafting an agreement like this would last that long anyway,â said Matthew Brazil, a former government official who now runs Madeira Security Consulting, a firm in San Jose, Calif.
Why the espionage has spiked again is a matter of debate. Some officials and analysts call it a cause of the worsening trade relationships, others a symptom. Still others argued that the tightening of American export controls in critical industries like aerospace and rules on Chinese investment in Silicon Valley â which China sees as part of a âcontainmentâ strategy to blunt its industrial and geopolitical rise â has led the Chinese once again to try to steal what they cannot buy.
The impetus for the 2015 accord was one of the most blatant espionage operations ever conducted by the Chinese government: the removal, over a period of more than a year, of 22 million security-clearance files on American officials, military personnel, contractors and American intelligence officers.
The Obama administration, partly out of embarrassment, said little about the breach, never naming the Chinese publicly â except by mistake when the director of national intelligence blurted out the truth.
Privately, American intelligence officials concluded that the Chinese were assembling a giant database of who worked with whom, and on what, in the American national security sphere, and were applying âbig dataâ techniques to analyze the information. The C.I.A. could not move some officers to China, for fear their cover had been blown. Publicly, Obama administration officials offered millions of Americans credit protection for a few years in the wake of the data breach â as if Mr. Xiâs agents were looking for credit card numbers.
But Mr. Obama used the episode, and the threat of sanctions, to force Mr. Xi into what he called a âcommon understandingâ that neither the United States nor China should engage in state-sponsored cyberintrusions to poach intellectual property, and that they would together seek âinternational rules of the road for appropriate conduct in cyberspace.â
All that was forgotten after Mr. Obama left office. Mr. Trump has never referred publicly to the 2015 agreement.
Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who is now a China analyst for the International Crisis Group, said that China had a fundamentally different understanding of what was acceptable in espionage. While the Central Intelligence Agency, say, would not act to help a private company gain a competitive advantage over a foreign competitor, he said, Chinaâs Communist Party, which has control over practically all aspects of policy there, would make no such distinction.
âIf you view economic growth as an existential pillar of your partyâs political legitimacy and in fact your national security, it follows that you would do anything possible to maintain that competitive edge,â he said.
Indeed, the latest spike in corporate espionage cases â including some not yet made public â has focused on industries critical to Mr. Xiâs Made in China 2025 program.
That is a plan to jump ahead of the United States and others in cutting-edge industries like aerospace, automation, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
âWe are seeing it in high tech, in law firms, in insurance companies,â said Dmitri Alperovitch, one of the founders of CrowdStrike, who early in his career was one of the first to identify the teams of state-run Chinese hackers aiming at the United States, and who tracked their retreat after the 2015 pledge.
With the arrest of the intelligence officer in Belgium in October, the Trump administration claimed it had exposed what the assistant F.B.I. director, Bill Priestap, called âthe Chinese governmentâs direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States.â
That case involves Xu Yanjun, a deputy division director in the Jiangsu branch of the Ministry of State Security, Chinaâs main intelligence agency.
According to a secret criminal complaint filed in Ohio in March but not unsealed until October, Mr. Xu tried to recruit an employee of General Electric Aviation and entice him to provide proprietary information about jet fan blade designs.
Instead the employee alerted the company, which went to the F.B.I. and organized a sting. Mr. Xu flew from China to Belgium in April on the hope he would be able to copy the employeeâs computer hard drive. He was arrested on April 1 when he arrived in Brussels and was extradited to the United States on Oct. 9, the day before the Justice Department made the case public.
Chinaâs Foreign Ministry denounced the criminal case as âpure fabrication,â but it has neither confirmed nor denied that Mr. Xu was an intelligence officer. Chinaâs relatively muted reaction could be an effort to minimize attention on an embarrassing intelligence failure and leave room for quiet negotiations for an exchange.
Mr. Xuâs was the most high profile of several recent cases, including two others that had links to the Ministry of State Securityâs branch in Jiangsu Province, which extends north from Shanghai.
In September, the Justice Department announced the arrest of Ji Chaoqun, a 27-year-old graduate student who had joined the Army Reserves under a special waiver for foreigners.
The F.B.I. affidavit in the case said that Mr. Jiâs handler â presumably Mr. Xu â had been arrested, allowing the bureau to send an undercover officer to meet the student in April. Mr. Ji, the affidavit said, had been recruited to gather background information about eight potential recruits for the Jiangsu branch.
Mr. Xu, who went by at least two aliases, often claimed to represent the Jiangsu Association for International Science and Technology Cooperation and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, both based in the provincial capital, Nanjing.
The reasons Jiangsu has become a hotbed of Chinaâs cyberespionage are not entirely clear, though it is an important manufacturing center, with many foreign investments, and is thus one of Chinaâs richest provinces.
In 2016, the director of the Jiangsu intelligence branch, Liu Yang, declared that âthe national security departments should actively cooperate and promote enterprisesâ in their efforts to expand and compete globally, according to a report from the Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce. In January, Mr. Liu was promoted and is now the vice governor of the province.
Another American criminal case of espionage in the same region of China was announced Oct. 30. The Justice Department accused two other intelligence officers from that branch, as well as five hackers and two employees of a French aerospace company in Suzhou. The target was Safran, which operates a joint venture, CFM International, that builds jet engines with General Electric.
The hackers were accused of using a variety of sophisticated techniques and tools against the Suzhou plant, and against other companies. But as in the cases the Obama administration brought, the suspects are believed to still be in China and thus beyond the reach of American law enforcement.

A Big New Airport Shows Chinaâs Strengths (and Weaknesses),"The New York Times, Inter national edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2139692651?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Rising out of the farmlands of southern Beijing in a web of concrete, rebar and glass, one of the worldâs largest airports is preparing to open after just five years of construction â a striking contrast to the infrastructure travails of far richer places. (See: New York City, subway; Britain, train service; Berlin, airport.)
Just as impressive as its speed are the airportâs broader goals. It is meant to shift the Chinese capitalâs center of gravity away from its high-tech university district in the north toward its poorer southern suburbs â part of an even more ambitious plan to remake Beijing and its hinterland into an 82,000-square-mile economic locomotive for northern China. And it will do so by relocating thousands of residents with few protests, at least so far.
Yet the airport also reflects a less glamorous side of Chinaâs rapid change: a reliance on the heavy hand of big infrastructure as a salve for deeper problems in politics and economics.
These intractable problems include an overbearing military, whose dominance of Chinese airspace hobbles existing airports, as well as a broad retreat from market-driven economic reforms, leading to a dependence on infrastructure investment to increase growth.
â In China everything is related to economic development,â said Guo Yufeng, chief executive of Q&A Consulting, a China-based aviation advisory firm that has studied the new airport.
âThey needed something to drive growth.â
Cue the new airport.
Scheduled to open next September, the Beijing Daxing International Airport will lift Chinaâs capital into the stratosphere of aviation superlatives. The golden, starfish-shaped terminal designed by the Iraqi-British star architect Zaha Hadid, who died in 2016, is billed as the worldâs largest at 7.5 million square feet (700,000 square meters) but promises short walking distances despite its size.
By 2025, the airport will be able to serve 72 million passengers a year. That, along with the existing Beijing Capital International Airportâs annual capacity of 96 million passengers, would make Beijing one of the worldâs busiest city airport systems, rivaling for top spot the 170 million carried by Londonâs six airports, based on 2017 figures. Ultimately, Daxing is expected to handle 100 million passengers a year.
One reason for the new airport is rapidly increasing passenger volumes, which rose in 2017 by nearly 13 percent nationwide. Aviation experts say, however, that at least some of this could be handled with existing infrastructure, were it not for the militaryâs heavy hand.
With roughly 70 percent of airspace controlled by the military (versus 20 percent in the United States), commercial aircraft flying in China are limited to narrow tunnels in the sky. This restricts options for departure and arrival routing, cutting the number of takeoffs and landings that airports can handle.
Beijing Capital, for example, was the worldâs second-busiest airport based on passenger volume in 2017, but it ranked fifth based on takeoffs and landings, nearly a third fewer than the world leader, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
The lack of airspace is also a key reason delays are so common in China. Last year, flight delays increased 50 percent, with only 71 percent of flights taking off on time, according to government statistics. Thatâs helped push Chinese airlines to the bottom of punctuality rankings, with one study ranking three Chinese airlines as the worst among 20 large-scale carriers.
Although aviation authorities blame the weather for half of the delays, Mr. Guo of Q&A Consulting said the underlying cause was the military-induced lack of airspace.
When a corridor is blocked by a thunderstorm, for example, Chinese flight controllers often cannot reroute an airplane, because it would have to enter military airspace. That causes planes to sit on the ground or fly holding patterns when in other countries they could land or take off.
âThe congestion takes place in the sky because the military only allows for a certain number of tunnels,â Mr. Guo said. âIf that doesnât change, the ground infrastructure needs to be expanded.â
The new airport will help by initially opening four, then up to eight, new runways in the suburb of Daxing, 41 miles southwest of Beijing Capital. The number of air corridors available for civilian use stays the same, but the new runways will provide airlines with more ways to gain access to this limited airspace, allowing the Beijing area to facilitate more flights.
The biggest challenge in building new airports is usually land, said Jean-Paul Rodrigue, who studies global infrastructure at Hofstra University.
âSize is just a matter of scaling up â you hire a good architect and a few consulting firms and theyâll give you a nice design,â Professor Rodrigue said. âBut the major challenge is to find the piece of real estate in order to do that. Itâs mind-boggling how much this takes.â
Beijing Daxing occupies 18 square miles of land, more than two-thirds the size of Manhattan, in southern Beijing and the adjacent province of Hebei. Itâs trumpeted as a key part of the âJing-Jin-Jiâ economic development plan, which will unite Beijing, Hebei, and the port city of Tianjin into an economic region to rival the countryâs more prosperous economic hubs, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
Obtaining this land wasnât a problem, because in China all land is owned by the state. Protests do occur in China when communities are razed to make way for megaprojects â especially in years past, when some people killed themselves rather than lose their homes.
But decades of forced evictions seem to have taught both sides some lessons.
For residents, itâs the futility of opposition.
âWho wants to leave?â said Li Zhengu, a resident of Ligezhuang village, one of 11 that are being demolished, along with 24 others where people are being moved to avoid noise. âBut there wasnât any discussion.â
Indeed, local media reported little about the relocation of more than 20,000 people, let alone broader questions about whether the increased traffic could be handled by Beijing Capital if the military loosened its grip on airspace. Instead, the new airport was portrayed as further proof of Chinaâs rise.
Besides clamping down on public discussion, the government is offering what residents say are generous packages. Residents say that on average, they are getting 50 square meters per person in living space, $150,000 per family in one-time compensation and a monthly stipend of $300 to cover basic living costs.
Mr. Li said the money was fair, but added: âThen you donât have land to grow on. And you have to figure out a new life.â
As he spoke, a live broadcast echoed through the village: âDonât complain,â a male voice said through large loudspeakers. âYou could influence the entire villageâs stability.â
Stability, though, can be defined in other ways.
Chen Zhen, a 29-year-old data processor at a local bank, said the older generation in his family was stunned by the destruction of their family home.
âIn my family, Iâm fine, but my octogenarian grandma, she spent her whole life painstakingly building the courtyard home, one brick and one tile at a time,â Mr. Chen said. âAfterward, we didnât dare go back to look.â
Five minutes down the road is the village of Qigezhuang, which would lie in such a noisy area that it would no longer be habitable. Its brick-and-tiled courtyard homes were flattened in August. A muddy teddy bear lay on the road, across from old millstones strewn across the rubble.
Behind a corrugated fence, an elevated highway curled gracefully toward the orange terminal building in the distance.
A late autumn wind crackled through the yellowing leaves, drowning out the enormous dump trucks and backhoes in the distance and making the scene seem unreal â that someone, somewhere, had decided that one way of life would end and another would begin.

Will Trump Speak Up Against Chinaâs Oppression?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2149146 321?accountid=14586,"As President Trump prepares to meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the G-20 gathering in Argentina this weekend, tough American tariffs and a broader bilateral trade relationship are at the top the agenda.
But what about concerns that the Trump administration has expressed in the past over Beijingâs repression and mass internment of Uighurs and other Muslims? Some of Mr. Trumpâs top lieutenants, like Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have called attention to the Uighursâ plight, but given the presidentâs fixation on tariffs, he may well decide to hold his fire about the Uighurs to appease Mr. Xi in pursuit of a trade deal. So itâs no surprise that the White House is refusing to say whether the Uighurs will be on the agenda.
The dilemma Mr. Trump faces has some faint echoes from 1989, when President George H.W. Bush had to figure out how to recalibrate relations with China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Of course, Mr. Trump lacks the experience or subtlety that Mr. Bush â a former director of the C.I.A. and envoy to China â brought to that fraught diplomatic moment.
Mr. Bush âwanted to safeguard the underlying geopolitical relationship,â his secretary of state, James Baker, wrote in October. Still, Mr. Baker added, âThe United States could not be viewed as a cynical paper tiger on human rights.â
At that time, China was just beginning the economic reforms that would eventually make it an international force to be reckoned with, and relations with the United States were at a peak. Responding to pressure from Congress and international outrage over the widely publicized Tiananmen Square killings, the Bush administration imposed limited sanctions on Beijing while maintaining dialogue with Chinese officials.
Today, when another, more hostile strategic realignment between Beijing and Washington seems to be underway, there is again an urgent need to address at the highest levels of the American government what have been described as Chinaâs worst human rights abuses in decades. They are largely happening in secret to a group of people who are little known outside China.
Mr. Xi has imposed Chinaâs most sweeping internment program since Mao Zedongâs Cultural Revolution, when more than a million people were killed and millions of others were imprisoned, tortured and humiliated.
As Mr. Pompeo and other senior officials have acknowledged, Chinese officials are forcibly holding hundreds of thousands â perhaps more than one million â Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims in camps across the northwest Central Asian border region of Xinjiang without any formal legal process.
There have been credible reports of torture, starvation and death in the camps. There are, as well, accusations that officials have forced detainees to renounce traditional Islamic practices and swear allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party. On Thursday, CNN reported that a Chinese photojournalist, Lu Guang, had disappeared in China after being seized by authorities in Xinjiang.
Overlaying all of this is a sophisticated surveillance system that uses cameras, biometric data and phone apps to reinforce state control. Officials reportedly have also deployed more than a million Chinese civilians, mostly members of the countryâs Han majority, to occupy the homes of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang in order to indoctrinate and monitor them. The Uighurs, numbering about 11 million, are the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang.
Beijing argues that the crackdown is needed to combat extremism and terrorism on its western frontier and says that many of those detained are common criminals. But Mr. Pompeo has said that Uighur âreligious beliefs are decimated.â
And Mr. Pence, in a hard-hitting speech in October, lambasted a ânew wave of persecutionâ that is âcrashing down on Chinese Christians, Buddhists and Muslims.â He said the Uighurs âendure round-the-clock brainwashingâ as part of a âdeliberate attempt by Beijing to strangle Uighur culture and stamp out the Muslim faith.â
Such rhetoric helped focus more international attention on the campaign of oppression against the Uighurs, but itâs not nearly enough. While Western countries have begun to speak out, where is the outrage from Muslim countries? Why arenât Chinaâs neighbors demanding an end to the abuses?
The world can ill afford to remain mute, as it did for too long when the generals in Myanmar began unleashing genocide against the Rohingyas, members of a Muslim ethnic group that have been killed by the thousands and forced to flee to Bangladesh.
For several months, administration officials have been discussing whether to impose punitive measures on China over its treatment of Uighurs. In mid-November, lawmakers in Washington introduced legislation that would level sanctions on specific Chinese officials and limit the sales of American technology products to certain Chinese state agencies.
If Mr. Trump refuses to confront Mr. Xi in Argentina and take strong measures against Chinese officials for their mass repression, Congress will be obliged to act.

Steve Bannon and a Fugitive Billionaire Target a Common Enemy: China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2150747611?accountid=14586,"Just months after being pushed out of the White House, Stephen K. Bannon, President Trumpâs former chief strategist, met with a fugitive Chinese billionaire at a suite in the luxurious Hays-Adams Hotel in Washington.
The billionaire, Guo Wengui, who is also known as Miles Kwok, was living in New York City and had landed on Chinaâs most-wanted list, accused of bribery, fraud and money laundering. He was also a dissident and fierce critic of Beijing, seeking political asylum in the United States. And Mr. Bannon â increasingly obsessed with the emerging China threat â was eager to talk about the Communist Party, corruption and American naval operations in the South China Sea.
Since their first discussion in October 2017, they have met dozens of times â in Dallas, on Mr. Guoâs yacht and, more often, at the billionaireâs $67.5 million apartment in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, overlooking New Yorkâs Central Park. The two shared a stage two weeks ago in Manhattan, at a news conference they organized to announce plans to set up a $100 million fund to investigate corruption and aid people they deem victims of Chinese government persecution.
âWe both naturally despise the Chinese Communist Party,â Mr. Guo said in an interview last week, referring to Mr. Bannon. âThatâs why weâve become partners.â
Itâs an unusual partnership between two political gadflies with a common, if overly grand, objective: bringing about the demise of the Chinese Communist Party.
One is an exiled businessman who claims to have evidence of corruption at the highest levels of government in China. The other is a former Goldman Sachs banker who delights in lobbing political grenades at what he calls the âparty of Davos,â a band of global elites that he says has undermined Americaâs interests at home and abroad.
As tensions between the United States and China grow, the two men are hoping to stoke them even further, by effectively calling for the overthrow of Beijingâs leadership. Mr. Guo is dipping into his fortune, while Mr. Bannon has agreed to provide a strategy.
Mr. Bannon is, in effect, reprising the role of political provocateur he played before joining the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016. Back then, he was running the conservative news site Breitbart, and helping promote conspiracy theories through the publication of books like âClinton Cash,â which aimed to destroy Hillary Clintonâs White House bid.
In an interview in his hotel room two weeks ago, Mr. Bannon, 65, said the new China-related fund he will head, without pay, will gather evidence, share it with authorities â in the United States and elsewhere â and publish it in the media. The fund also targets Wall Street banks and law firms, which he says are complicit in Chinaâs misdeeds.
The project, he says, is consistent with his populist and nationalist agenda. Chinaâs reckless behavior, he contended, is endangering the global economy, and sapping Americaâs strength.
âAs a populist, this is outrageous,â Mr. Bannon said, noting that American financial institutions have helped back the worrisome global buying sprees of Chinese companies, with cash raised from ordinary people, including government pension funds. âThe elites in this country have to be held accountable. We have to get the facts on the table.â
Mr. Guo, 50, insists that the fund offers a way to strike back at Beijing. China has pressed the Trump administration to extradite him so that he can face a raft of charges in China â allegations he strongly denies. Billions of dollars in assets he controlled have been frozen by Beijing. And Interpol, the global police organization, has issued a warrant seeking his arrest. He now travels with a phalanx of security guards, saying he fears for his life.
The Chinese Embassy could not be reached for comment. But the Guo-Bannon alliance has alarmed some analysts, who view the two men as purveyors of conspiracy theories fueling anti-China sentiment.
âThe problem with these types of reckless, loose-cannon accusations is that they undermine the ability of responsible analysts and policymakers to identify the genuine cases of Chinese wrongdoing and fashion realistic and effective policy responses,â said Michael D. Swaine, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
For Mr. Bannon, the new effort plays to a longstanding and complicated interest in China. As a young naval officer in the 1970s, he patrolled the South China Sea. He also lived for a time in Shanghai, where he ran a small online gaming company. In recent years, he has come to view China as a military threat to the United States, and a fierce economic rival that refuses to play by the rules.
In helping elect Donald J. Trump, Mr. Bannon counseled him to take a tough line on China and step up trade pressure on Beijing. Mr. Trump obliged by tapping the Harvard-trained economist Peter Navarro, a longtime China critic known for his book âDeath by China,â and Michael Pillsbury, a China hawk at the Hudson Institute, as top trade advisers.
It was during his time at the White House, Mr. Bannon says, that he first heard about Mr. Guo. The Chinese billionaire was living in New York, broadcasting allegations of high-level government corruption in China on Twitter and YouTube â some credible, some outlandish and still unproved. By then, he had also applied for political asylum.
Alarmed by his social media campaign and his public denunciations of the Communist Party, Beijing began pressing the Trump administration to extradite Mr. Guo. Chinese investigators said he has ties to Ma Jian, a former spy chief now imprisoned in China on charges of bribery and abuse of power.
Inside the White House, there were disagreements over how to deal with Mr. Guo. Several Western businessmen, apparently eager to cozy up to Beijing, lobbied President Trump to accede to Chinaâs demands, according to people familiar with the talks.
Mr. Bannon said he sided with those in the administration who opposed any handover, viewing Mr. Guo as a potentially valuable âintelligence asset.â
They met only after Mr. Bannon was forced out of the White House. Mr. Bannon says he received a call from Bill Gertz, a Washington journalist who has long been critical of China. Mr. Gertz told him that Mr. Guo was scheduled to give a talk in Washington at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. The talk was canceled at the last minute.
Over lunch, Mr. Guo and Mr. Bannon discussed Chinaâs military capabilities, as well as the financial implications of Beijingâs rule, including what impact the countryâs mounting corporate debt might have on its economy. A friendship emerged.
âIt was fantastic. He really impressed me,â Mr. Bannon said of his first meeting with Mr. Guo. âWe talked about President Trumpâs approach to China, and he went into corruption in the Chinese Communist Party.â
Mr. Bannon later introduced Mr. Guo to people in the hedge fund community, including J. Kyle Bass, who has soured on China and sought to profit by short-selling the Chinese currency.
As Mr. Bannon sharpened his critique of Chinaâs rise, he also began meeting privately with some of Americaâs leading experts on China, to seek their counsel and outline his agenda. Few welcomed his strident remarks, according to people who attended some of the sessions. But more recently, analysts say, his positions have gotten a warmer reception.
âThe tectonic plates are shifting,â says Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. âMany analysts would have totally rejected him two years ago. But people are more sympathetic now that engagement with China has been defrocked.â
Mr. Schell adds, âOn the China question, heâs no longer the skunk at the party.â
But Mr. Bannon is getting blowback from some of Beijingâs friends. On a trip abroad this year to drum up support for nationalist and populist leaders in Eastern and Central Europe, Mr. Bannon says, he was scolded for his positions on China by Milos Zeman, president of the Czech Republic and one of Beijingâs closest allies in the region.
âHe threw down on me hard,â Mr. Bannon says. âHe said: âTell Trump you didnât learn from Hitler. You canât fight on two fronts. You canât take on radical Islam and China. You will end up in the bunker, like Hitler.â
A spokesman for President Zeman said that he had challenged Mr. Bannon on American tariffs against China, and that the two men had parted ways in a very âcold atmosphere.â
Mr. Bannon is unbowed. He has agreed to serve as chairman of the so-called Rule of Law Fund, the $100 million effort that Mr. Guo is financing. The fund plans to publicize its findings and offer financial support to businessmen, government officials and others who run afoul of the Chinese authorities â including those who flee overseas, like Mr. Guo himself.
Mr. Bannon has also joined Mr. Guo in targeting the HNA Group, the huge Chinese conglomerate that borrowed heavily and spent billions around the world, before debt and regulatory pressures forced the company to curb its global ambitions.
Until Twitter suspended his account late last year, Mr. Guo was waging an online war against HNA and its top executives. He claimed, without proof, that the company was engaged in bribing top officials and their relatives, and has even spun conspiracy theories about the death of the companyâs co-chairman Wang Jian in an accident in France last summer. HNA declined to comment.
At their joint news conference last week, Mr. Bannon took the stage at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to say, âLiterally hundreds, if not thousands, of the best and brightestâ in China have disappeared, been imprisoned or committed suicide under unusual circumstances and without due process.
âToday is about recklessness and accountability,â he added, noting that American financial institutions have close ties to political elites in Beijing. âWho profited off this? Who looked the other way?â

"In Chinaâs Land of Buddhas and Fortresses, Kindness Prevails","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2154770061?accountid=14586,"Our columnist, Jada Yuan, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2018 list . This dispatch brings her to Gansu, China, which took the No. 17 spot. It is the 47th stop on Jadaâs itinerary.
She spoke first, a series of words in Chinese that I couldnât understand and then one that I did: âLanzhou?â
âDui! Dui! I am going to Lanzhou, too,â I said, nodding vigorously to the kind-faced woman in her 40s, as we established that we were both alone and flying to the capital of Chinaâs Gansu Province â a spot in the countryâs interior along a northwestern part of the ancient Silk Road trade route â and that neither of us spoke the otherâs language.
I had taken notice of Wei Zhaohan in the Beijing airport when she started listening to Chinese pop music videos next to me without headphones. This was my sixth or so visit to China, but my first without my relatives, who mainly hail from Shanghai and Beijing, and Iâd been missing that familiar element of noise and chaos: everyone talking over each other, picnic spreads of steamed buns and fruit laid out across airport waiting room chairs.
Ms. Wei, who runs an architectural business, and I bonded quickly. As we boarded the plane she got the man sitting next to me to switch seats with her. âLetâs be friends,â she said through her Baidu translation app (Chinaâs version of Google, which is blocked), and followed that with a declaration that she would give me a ride from the airport to my hotel.
âYou can trust that I am a good person!â she wrote into Baidu, and laughed as her friend drove us down a dark highway toward Lanzhou after midnight, which might be the midpoint of a Stephen King novel under other circumstances. But she was just one in a series of people who jumped in to help me â ordering for me at restaurants, getting me safely to my hotel, as Ms. Wei did. Most of them didn't realize I was Chinese-American at first; they just seemed to see a woman on her own in a strange land looking rather lost.
A magnificent stretch of desert sandwiched between mountains, Gansu was once Chinaâs Wild West, containing the westernmost structures of The Great Wall, built to ward off attacking nomadic hordes, and legendary shrines dug into cliffs for the westward spread of Buddhism.
It had made the 52 Places list for 2018, because the opening of high-speed rail lines had made its treasures, including the rainbow-striped mountains in the Zhangye Danxia National Geological Park, easier to get to.
But easier is relative and Gansu in November was not easy. Temperatures were below freezing in a landscape so beautifully barren it's hard to believe it can sustain life. There were few foreigners; almost no one spoke English; and I couldnât read menus or street signs. (I speak only basic, familial Chinese, like âI already ate,â and âno, really, I canât eat any more.â)
It made KuÃ©lap, the previous hardest-to-reach destination of this 52 Places trip, deep in the cloud forests of PerÃº, seem like a logistical breeze. At least there I knew some Spanish â and could read an address.
The new bullet trains follow the Northern Silk Road that once connected China and Eurasia, running from Xi'an in the east to Urumqi in the west. My plan was to spend two days writing, sleeping and getting my laundry done in Lanzhou, the province's biggest city, then speed northwest to the Great Wall sites of Jiayuguan, and visit Zhangye's geopark, located in between those two spots, on my eastward return. But train scheduling snafus and my new friends turned a lot of that upside down.
On the plane, Ms. Wei and I had scanned each otherâs QR codes on WeChat, which is a superior Chinese version of WhatsApp. The next day, I got a message from her that sheâd be coming to my hotel, the Wanda Vista, for dinner. It was the best hotel in town, she told me, and she eats there often. She met me in the lobby and walked me down a chandelier-lit hallway to a private room containing her sister, the friend whoâd picked us up, and his brother, whom Ms. Wei called âlingdao,â or âleader,â because he was the president of an important Chinese bank.
Theyâd already eaten, but insisted on ordering five more dishes just for me, all of them vegetarian, because Ms. Wei had noticed Iâd ordered a vegetarian meal on the plane. They drank hot water, which is a thing people do in the chilly North. And in between specialties like shredded potatoes stir-fried with chili peppers, Leader poured me shot glass after shot glass of baiju liquor. I know from many a banquet with my family that thereâs only one thing to do in that situation: lift your glass and shout, âGanbei!â
To the western frontier
My lungs were burning from the cold, dry air (and a decent amount of pollution) after climbing a mountainside near the city of Jiayuguan. I was standing on the Overhanging Great Wall, so named because it appears to cling to a ridge of the Black Mountains by some feat of wizardry. Ming dynasty tacticians built it in 1539, and from the peak there were views of the Gobi Desert in every direction, marked with bare mountains, oases, and in the distance, a steaming industrial plant.
It was hard not to marvel at sheer human will up there, including the amount Iâd had to employ just to get to the view.
The afternoon after my dinner with Ms. Wei, I had boarded a 6.5 hour train to Jiayuguan, which was the shortest I could find from the downtown Lanzhou train station â after I learned all the high-speed trains were sold out and left from a new train station, Lanzhou West, on the outskirts of the city, anyway.
Onboard, a police officer introduced me to Jo, an English teacher from Jiayuguan. She not only woke me up when we had to get off the train at 2:30 a.m., but had her husband drive me to my hotel, where she negotiated my rate down to $29 for two nights (as opposed to the $90 Iâd booked online). I showered and huddled under my covers with all my winter clothes on because I couldnât figure out the heater. But I sure was glad I wasnât paying $60 more for that.
The next morning, at Joâs suggestion, I walked on Jiayuguanâs wide, relatively empty boulevards to a local restaurant, Wu Mai Er, to try a regional specialty: Lanzhou hand-pulled beef noodles. When I couldnât communicate my order, a man in line bought my bowl for me and showed me how to pick it up, put chili sauce, or lajiao, in it, and then sit at a counter to slurp the noodles from the steaming broth.
Jo had also suggested that I charter a taxi for 150 renminbi ($22) to see Jiayuguanâs three Great Wall scenic sites. We drove through the Gobi Desert outside the city to the mound of mud that was once The First Beacon Tower of the Great Wall, or the westernmost end of the western defense. It was part of a system of 54 beacons that sent smoke signals down the wall to warn of enemy movements.
On the shuttle bus around the site, I met another woman traveler, Wei Gong, who had come by herself from Sichuan, and an English-speaking businessman from Nanjing, Yu Lihong, who helped me talk to my driver. The three of us didn't always keep the same pace, but we kept in touch over WeChat as we circuited the Overhanging Great Wall and the final site, Jiayu Pass, or fortress, which was so huge I had to go back the next day to see it all.
The fortress underwent an impressive renovation in 2014. The evening I went, as the desert temperatures dropped precipitously with the sunset, I had the entire place to myself, walking up stone ramps used for bringing horses to lookout points and rolling down logs to crush enemies. At the exit, I caught up with Wei Gong, who was waiting for her taxi. A man who ran a shop selling tea sets made out of a local stone invited us to sit inside next to his wood-burning stove to warm our freezing hands.
A monumental detour
The Unesco-recognized Caves of a Thousand Buddhas, known as the Mogao Grottoes, hadnât been on my radar, until Wei Gong invited me to come with her there. She was taking an overnight train hours after weâd left Jiayu Pass and I just couldnât do it. But I also couldnât get the idea out of my head. The 492 devotional caves, hand-carved into sandy cliffs, house the worldâs largest and longest-used treasure of Buddhist art in the world, to paraphrase Unesco. They were also a tempting 4.5 hours west of Jiayuguan, in the desert oasis of Dunhuang, and I never knew when Iâd be this close to them again.
With the help of Yu Lihong, I booked a 2 a.m. train from Jiayuguan. Iâd sprung for a luxurious âsoft sleeperâ car, with a comfortable bed and a door that closed. After four glorious hours of sleep, and a couple more waiting around in a taxi for the site to open, I walked into my first Mogao Cave to see 1,400 year-old Buddhas from the Tang dynasty.
You canât get into the caves without a guide. After a bit of asking around I found an English-speaking tour, which had three people on it, including me.
The caves, whose ceilings are covered in hundreds of little Buddha portraits to convey Buddhaâs infinite nature, date back to the year 366, when a monk named Le Zun went for a walk in the desert, had a vision of a thousand Buddhas bathed in a golden light, and was inspired to dig a shrine out of sandstone.
For centuries, devotees would dig caves and decorate them with enormous Buddhas, until the Silk Road declined, and people stopped coming. The caves remained intact and untouched (save for the work of a few shrine robbers) only to be revived over the last century with the discovery of a huge trove of Buddhist documents from the 11th century.
The centerpiece of the site is a five-story pagoda-like structure. As I walked in, a crowd of people were leaving and the light was so dim it was difficult to see. There was something big ahead. Was that a foot? I looked up to see a 98-foot-tall Buddha.
There are bigger Buddhas in China and the world, but likely none feel as intimate as standing inside a building thatâs basically the same size as the Buddha, forcing you to crane your neck up to look at him and stay always in a supplicant position. The feat of human determination and faith that brought this massive statue into existence is overwhelming to contemplate. I think about that Buddha a lot and how close I had to stand to him to see him, and how tiny I felt in that moment.
The planning committee takes charge
A planning committee had gathered outside my compartment on an overnight slow train. I had, it turned out, a certain love for the more social, populist âhard sleeperâ cars â with no doors and six bunks to a room â where the inability to sit up straight on any bed but the bottom meant lots of congregating in corridors. I also had a pile of logistical dilemmas, which piqued the interest of some English-speakers whoâd overheard me discussing them with the conductor.
For my last day in the country, with a flight to Japan at 9 p.m., I had concocted a harebrained plan to spend the morning at Zhangye Danxia Landform National Geopark, or the Rainbow Mountains, then hop on a three-hour bullet train to the Lanzhou West station, and take another 40-minute train from there to the Lanzhou airport. But the trip was going to require precision engineering.
First, Lien Shaoyong, a fellow eastward-bound traveler I had met at the grottoes, struck a deal for me with the conductor. I had a ticket for only part of the journey because the final leg to Zhangye had been sold out. The solution: pay cash for the difference and the staff would wake me in the middle of the night to move me to an empty slot since my bed was already spoken for.
Next on the scene was Song Xu, my bunkmate and a businessman with excellent English. He began plotting my day backward from my last possible arrival time at the airport. A college student, Liu Haocheng, joined us, as did another businessman sitting nearby. The family of three whose bottom bunks weâd commandeered listened in with bemusement as Mr. Liu translated the action into Chinese. âYouâre doing this by yourself?â the mother said, nodding with approval. âVery brave.â
With the four of us checking websites and making phone calls in both Chinese and English, we nailed down a plan in a mere two hours. A driver named Tao Hongbing would pick me up when the train got in at 2 a.m., help me buy tickets for the legs back to the Lanzhou airport, find me a cheap by-the-hour hotel for a quick rest, pick me up again at 7 a.m. in order to get me to the geopark before sunrise, and then return me to the Zhangye train station to make the bullet train to Lanzhou that was holding this whole Jenga schedule in place.
Mr. Tao picked me up while it was still dark and we drove to the park, past trucks making early morning deliveries, and droves of children riding their bicycles to school. Private cars canât go inside, so I boarded the first hop-on-hop-off bus of the day, which was carrying all the security guards and park workers, in their fur hats and winter coats, to their posts. The temperature gauge read minus-seven-degrees Celsius (19 degrees Fahrenheit).
After a short drive down red brick roads, a guard shouted something that I assumed meant âGet off!â as we pulled up to the second of four scenic overlook platforms on the route. Along with two other tourists, I raced up flights of steps and along wooden boardwalks just in time to watch the sun peek over a sea of red hills and valleys and pillars and anthropomorphic sandstone formations that rivaled anything Iâve seen in the American Southwest. Then stripes in yellows and greens and whites and maroons began to emerge as sunlight bathed the landscape. Theyâre the result of mineral deposits organizing themselves during tectonic movements over tens of million of years.
WeChat messages began flooding in from the planning committee, who wanted to know how it was all going, and from Mr. Yu and both Ms. Weis, as well as from my aunt, uncle and cousin from Queens who happened to be visiting Shanghai for Thanksgiving but whom I wouldnât be able to see. The other tourists had gone and I was alone on a freezing cold mountaintop across the world from a life Iâd left behind almost a year ago, overlooking what could have been Mars, and I felt at home.
Practical Tips
Just Getting In Most foreigners must get a visa in advance directly from a Chinese consulate to enter the country â which also involves surrendering your passport for a period of hours or weeks. Citizens of five countries including the U.S. and Canada can and should get a 10-year multi-entry visa.
You must show evidence of entering and exiting flights as well as accommodation, which can feel uncomfortable if your travel dates hinge around getting a visa. Air China has reasonable change and cancellation fees â and there are some ways to get around the requirement.
Money Matters Get plenty of cash at an A.T.M.; I was able to use my credit card only twice, in nicer hotels in Gansu. But be careful not to take out too much. Itâs easy to exchange renminbi for Asian currencies if youâre traveling onward, but foreigners have a limit on how many dollars they can buy back and few U.S. banks will exchange your overflow on your return.
Connection Websites like Google, Gmail, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are banned. Get around that by using a VPN that makes it appear as if your IP address is outside China; I have a yearlong subscription to one, which has proved invaluable in the 52 Places. Set it up on both your computer and your phone. It also ensures that websites come up in your language instead of Chinese.
Mobile signals proved significantly more reliable (and less restrictive) than Wi-Fi in Gansu. Pick up a local SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hot spot, which runs off cell signals, at the airport.
Apps Downloading WeChat was an incredible lifeline. It can connect you to everyone you meet, including taxi drivers, whoâd write to me in English using translation apps. If words arenât working, send pictures.
All translation apps are flawed, but I like Google Translate for its free archive of conversations. iTranslate Voice is easiest for other people to read and SayHi seems to be the most accurate.
Sundries Carry multiple tissue packets. Napkins and toilet paper are rarely provided. Shampoo in hotels is also a rarity.
Lodging The Wanda Vista Hotel where I stayed in Lanzhou for $148 a night has one of the most opulent lobbies Iâve ever seen, complete with a room-size chandelier in the shape of a rose and a floor-to-ceiling depiction of the Silk Road rendered in carpet. Just watch out for that laundry bill. (Mine was $100.) Most hotels in smaller cities will negotiate an hourly rate if you are looking to rest before a late-night train.
Eat Hand-pulled beef noodles for breakfast is an inspired choice, and the best I had was at a place called Master Hongâs in Dunhuang. Asking around got me to incredible spinach jiaozi at a tiny counter shop called Good Again Dumplings in Jiayuguan. Vegetarians can look forward to exceptional si ji dou, or flash-fried green beans with chili peppers. When in doubt, make like a traveling businessman and ask for the âfood street.â Every city has one or two.
Sights You canât take pictures inside the caves of the Mogoa Grottoes, so if you want to document your trip to Dunhuang, try riding a camel around the sand dunes surrounding the Crescent Lake oasis. Any taxi you hire will combine the two sites, or there is a cheap bus.
Transport, roads Charter taxis are a cheap (by U.S. standards) and a stress-free way to get around to multiple tourist sites in one city in a day, not to mention free luggage storage. I kept my valuables with me and trusted that my drivers wouldnât take off with my dirty clothes before getting paid. Rates should be between 150 and 180 renminbi ($22 to $26), negotiated in advance, and it is common for your driver to pick up other passengers. My Jiayuguan hotel found me a driver who later connected me with Mr. Tao in Zhangye. The only time I felt gouged was in Dunhuang, the most touristic of my stops, where Iâd found a cab on arrival and my rate mysteriously went up by 100 renminbi over the course of the day.
Transport, trains Most train station ticket agents donât speak English and kiosks for ticket purchases donât have English options. To buy with a foreign credit card, use a site like trip.com, but youâll still need to go to the ticket window to pick it up. I found it easiest to have a Chinese speaker accompany me to the ticket window and purchase advance tickets in cash.
To take a high-speed train, look for the station with a direction in the name, like Zhangye West or Jiayuguan South.
Save time and hotel charges by taking overnight trains. Book a âsoft sleeperâ if you need sensory deprivation to rest. âHard sleeperâ cars are way more fun. Keep your valuables away from the doorway. Whole meals, including corn on the cob are sold onboard, but most people bring their own food.

A Photographerâs Quest to Reverse Chinaâs Historical Amnesia,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2162552205?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â The photographer Li Zhensheng is on a mission to make his fellow Chinese remember one of the most turbulent chapters in modern Chinese history that the ruling Communist Party is increasingly determined to whitewash.
âThe whole world knows what happened during the Cultural Revolution,â Mr. Li said. âOnly China doesnât know. So many people have no idea.â
Clad in a dark blue photographerâs vest, Mr. Li, 78, spoke in a recent interview in Hong Kong, where the first Chinese-language edition of his book âRed-Color News Soldierâ was published in October by the Chinese University Press of Hong Kong.
Blending history and memoir, the photo book compiles images taken by Mr. Li in the 1960s when he was working at a local newspaper in northeastern China. Since 2003, the photos have been exhibited in more than 60 countries, bearing witness around the world to the Cultural Revolution â the decade-long turmoil that unfolded from 1966 and turned students against teachers, sons against fathers, and friends against friends.
With the new edition of his book, Mr. Li joins the small ranks of Chinese who survived the excesses of Mao Zedongâs rule and are determined to challenge the official historical narrative at a time when President Xi Jinping has pushed to suppress criticism of his partyâs traumatic past. Under Mr. Xiâs rule, the authorities have waged a broad ideological crackdown on dissenting voices, making efforts to objectively chronicle history fraught with risk.
In China, the Cultural Revolution has become an increasingly taboo topic and officials there have repeatedly blocked Mr. Liâs attempts to publish the photos. The new edition of his book can be distributed only within the semiautonomous city of Hong Kong, but that has not dampened his hopes of getting copies of it into the Chinese mainland.
âWeâll bring the books into the mainland one by one,â Mr. Li said. âItâll be like ants moving house.â
After Mao unleashed the Cultural Revolution, what began as a political campaign aimed at reasserting control at the top soon became a sweeping nationwide movement that shook all levels of society. Rival groups of militant youth known as Red Guards fought against one another and against perceived âclass enemies,â including intellectuals, officials and others.
Tens of millions of people were persecuted. Up to 1.5 million died as a result of the campaign, according to some estimates. Many were driven to suicide.
âNo other political movement in Chinaâs recent history lasted as long, was as widespread in its impact, and as deep in its trauma as the Cultural Revolution,â Mr. Li said.
He added that he was concerned that without a deep historical reckoning, something similar could happen in China again. Already, Mr. Xiâs efforts to elevate himself to the status of Mao and extend his rule indefinitely have for many evoked the days of one-man rule, when Mao was worshiped like a god, culminating in the disaster that was the Cultural Revolution.
Mr. Liâs collection of photos from that time is a nuanced portrayal of both the pain and the passion that the movement generated. At a time when cameras were scarce, he was given rare access to official events, taking more than 30,000 photos, many of which he carefully stashed under the floorboards of his home in the city of Harbin.
Among those are scenes of Red Guards forcing monks at a temple to denounce Buddhist scriptures and tearing out an officialâs hair because he was deemed as too closely resembling Mao. There are people shouting praises to Mao as they swim in the Songhua River. There are many images of officials and ordinary folk, some standing on chairs, some splattered with black ink, many bowing their heads, and all at the mercy of massive crowds denouncing them for supposed crimes, sentencing them to hard labor or taking them away for execution.
Mr. Liâs photos first gained widespread attention abroad in 2003, when he worked with Robert Pledge, the director of Contact Press Images in New York City, to publish âRed-Color News Soldier.â
Almost immediately, publishers in China began reaching out to Mr. Li, who had moved to New York to be closer to his children. Knowing that the photos had only a slim chance of receiving approval from Chinaâs official censors, Mr. Li and his editors in China made plans for a Chinese-language version of the book that would bury the contentious photos in a sea of text.
But censors rejected the nearly finished book with no explanation.
Livid, Mr. Li sent letters of protest to Chinaâs top leaders. One of his main points of contention: In 2000, Deng Xiaopingâs daughter had published a book about her father titled âDeng Xiaoping and the Cultural Revolution: A Daughter Recalls the Critical Years.â
âI was so angry,â Mr. Li recalled. âWhy can Deng Xiaoping share his Cultural Revolution experience and not Li Zhensheng?â
Now, more than a half-century after the Cultural Revolution began, there is little public discussion of that period in China. What some have called the nationâs collective amnesia has only gotten worse in recent years as leaders have walked back efforts to reckon with the countryâs modern history.
Last year, the South China Morning Post reported that a state-run publisher had evidently revised a middle-school history textbook to omit references to Maoâs âmistakesâ in stirring up the Cultural Revolution. And a recent exhibition at the Capital Museum in Beijing featuring historical images taken by photographers for the official news agency Xinhua made no mention of the Cultural Revolution.
The Cultural Revolution was not always off limits. In 1988, the organizers of a nationwide photography competition approached Mr. Li with a request that would be almost unimaginable in Chinaâs current political climate.
âWe canât have an entire decade of history missing in a competition as big as this,â Mr. Li recalled one of the organizers saying. So would he consider submitting his photos to the competition?
Mr. Li won the competition. The local news media and observers were stunned by the images, which depicted the Cultural Revolution more completely than had been seen before.
Seeing how the atmosphere has changed since that time, Mr. Li has only become more hardened in his resolve to see his photos published in China.
âSome people have criticized me, saying I am washing the countryâs dirty laundry in public,â he said, using a Chinese idiom that refers to the belief that a familyâs problems should not be aired in public. âBut Germany has reckoned with its Nazi past, America still talks about its history of slavery, why canât we Chinese talk about our own history?â
Though his photos cannot be published in the mainland, Mr. Li has given lectures on the Cultural Revolution at several Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University.
In 2017, a new museum dedicated to Mr. Liâs life and photography was opened in a small town in Sichuan Province. It was part of a cluster of private history museums opened by Fan Jianchuan, a property developer and history buff who, like Mr. Li, has become well-versed in the push and pull of Chinaâs censorship system.
But walking the line has meant making compromises. Sitting in his hotel room in Hong Kong, Mr. Li mentioned a new book he had been preparing using photos he had taken in Beijing during the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Asked if he had plans to publish the book, the normally opinionated photographer went quiet. He was hesitating, he said, because he was concerned the museum in Sichuan could get shut down by the authorities in retaliation.
âLetâs not talk about the Tiananmen book,â he said. âOne story at a time.â

Chinaâs Gulag for Muslims,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2162827887?accountid=14586,"One of the darkest episodes of the 20th century was the gulag â the Soviet system of forced labor camps where dissidents were imprisoned in terrible conditions, often to perish. The camps were established by Lenin, expanded by Stalin and finally exposed to the world by the great Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, with his 1973 masterpiece, âThe Gulag Archipelago.â
âThin strands of human lives stretch from island to island of Archipelago,â he wrote, and âit is enough if you donât freeze in the cold, and if thirst and hunger donât claw at your insides.â
Today, Russiaâs gulags are long gone, as is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that operated them. But now another dictatorship, ruled by another Communist Party, is operating a new chain of prisons that evoke memory of the gulags â more modern, more high-tech, but no less enslaving.
These are Chinaâs âre-education camps,â established in the far-western Xinjiang region, where up to a million Chinese are reportedly imprisoned in order to be indoctrinated. People are forced to listen to ideological lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write âself-criticismâ essays. Survivors also tell about military-style discipline, sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, beatings and torture.
The target of this mass persecution is Chinaâs Muslim minorities â especially the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking people based in Xinjiang. They follow a mainstream, moderate interpretation of Sunni Islam. But that is enough of a âmental illnessâ for Chinese Communists, whose ideology considers all religions, including Christianity, to be backward superstitions that must be diluted and nationalized. That is why they go as far as forbidding people from having beards or fasting during Ramadan, and forcing them to consume pork and alcohol, both of which are forbidden in Islam.
Chinese authorities say they are alarmed about extremists among the Uighurs â and, in fact, a handful of terrorists have carried out attacks against government targets over the years. But those extremists arose partly in response to a decades-old policy of subjugation, along with ethnic colonialization, that Beijing has pursued against the Uighurs. That history suggests that Beijingâs current âcounterterrorismâ campaign will be only counterproductive â deepening a vicious cycle that authoritarian minds are often unable to understand, let alone break.
And here is the strangest aspect of this story: Chinaâs âre-educationâ policy is a major attack on Muslim people and their faith, Islam, yet the Muslim world has remained largely silent. While the policy has been condemned by human rights groups and the liberal news media in the West, along with Uighur organizations themselves, only a few Muslim leaders, like the Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim and Pakistanâs minister of religion, Noorul Haq Qadri, have raised some public concerns. Not until last month did the Organization of Islamic Cooperation finally express concern about âthe disturbing reports on the treatment of Muslimsâ by China.
That is all very meek given how grim the situation is â and how it compares to what we would have seen if the same persecution had been carried out by some other country, such as, say, Israel.
Why is that? Why are Muslim leaders, especially those who love to be the champions of oppressed Muslims, so lenient toward China?
There are three answers. One is that coziness with China, the worldâs second-largest economic power, pays. China is the top trading partner of 20 of the 57 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a huge path of commercial and transportation infrastructure intended to pass through much of the Middle East, holds a lucrative promise for many Muslim nations.
Moreover, China does not shy away from offering its economic assistance as hush money. In July 2018, The Global Times, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, ran an interesting editorial suggesting that Chinaâs government would help Turkey secure its âeconomic stabilityâ â but only if Turkish officials stopped making âirresponsible remarks on the ethnic policy in Xinjiang,â which means stop criticizing Chinaâs human rights violations. (At about the same time, Germanyâs chancellor, Angela Merkel, was also promising to help the Turkish economy, but only if Turkey corrected its own human rights violations. In other words, Turkey was being pulled in opposite directions, and, sadly, the dark side has proved stronger so far.)
A second reason for Muslim silence is that the Chinese government crackdown on Uighurs is based on a premise that law and order can be restored by eradicating enemies of the government and traitors within a society. This is authoritarian language that most Muslim leaders understand well. It is their own language.
The third reason is that most Muslims who are likely to feel solidarity with their oppressed coreligionists think of the oppressors as âthe West,â defined as the capitalist, hedonist, Zionist civilization led by the Great Satan. These Muslims, particularly the Islamists, believe that all of their coreligionists should unite with other anti-Western forces â a stance that evokes Samuel Huntingtonâs prediction of a âConfucian-Islamicâ alliance against the West in his 1993 article in âForeign Affairsâ titled âThe Clash of Civilizations?â
For Muslim autocrats and Islamists, a Confucian-Islamic alliance may still be alluring. China can look like a great model, in which the economy grows without Western nuisances like human rights, free speech or limited government. For Muslim societies, however, the Uighur crisis must be a wake-up call. It shows what can happen to Muslims when authoritarian governments embrace Islamophobia as state policy.
Islamophobia exists in the liberal democracies of the West, too â but there it can be criticized by the news media, checked by the courts and constrained by liberal institutions and traditions. Muslims can still practice their religion freely, and can even become lawmakers by being elected to bodies like the United States Congress.
For Muslim societies, in other words, a choice between freedom and dictatorship should not be too difficult. In freedom, you can live as a Muslim in safety and dignity. Under dictatorship, as China shows us, you can end up in a re-education camp.

"In the Heart of B eijing, a Taiwanese Pop Idol Makes Fans Swoon","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2246225887?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â A beer in one hand, a microphone in the other, Meng Xiaoli stood in a crowded restaurant and began to sing.
During the workweek, Mr. Meng, 53, a strait-laced budget analyst who wears a red Chinese Communist Party pin on his lapel, spends his days shuttling between meetings and poring over reports as a budget analyst for a state-owned firm.
But on weekends, he retreats to what he calls his âspiritual home,â a two-story restaurant and museum in Beijing that is a shrine to the woman he considers a goddess: the Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Teng, one of Asiaâs most celebrated artists.
âShe knows what itâs like to be human â to find love and to make mistakes,â Mr. Meng said.
Ms. Teng, who died suddenly in 1995 at age 42, was renowned for turning traditional Taiwanese and Chinese folk songs into maudlin Western-style hits. She was once banned in the mainland, her music denounced by the authorities as âdecadentâ and âpornographic.â
But she never lost her base of rabid fans here, even as tensions have escalated between China and Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing considers part of its territory.
Her most ardent followers now gather at the Teresa Teng Music-Themed Restaurant in a sprawling residential neighborhood in western Beijing, near liquor stores, barbecue joints and hot pot restaurants. An enormous portrait of Ms. Teng, smiling as she holds a white rose, graces its front door.
Inside, singers dressed in elegant gowns perform renditions of her signature ballads like âThe Moon Represents My Heartâ and âSweet as Honey.â Customers sample dishes inspired by Ms. Tengâs music, including âmoon pancakesâ and fried pumpkin with honey sauce.
More than two decades after her death, Ms. Tengâs mainland fans say her sugary voice and gentle personality are still one of a kind.
âSheâs a storyteller,â said Zheng Rongbin, the media executive who opened the restaurant in 2011. âShe looks like the girl next door.â
At a recent lunchtime performance, Wu Yingwei, 30, watched as her daughter, Muyao, 2, danced to a performance of âAsk Yourself,â a song that is a staple of karaoke bars in Asia.
Ms. Wu said her daughter liked listening only to Ms. Tengâs songs and could sing several of her hits, including âSweet as Honey.â
âTeresa Tengâs style never gets old,â she said. âHer songs are very gentle and make me feel really warm.â
Ms. Teng is claimed by many mainlanders as one of their own, even though she was born in Taiwan.
Her father, who grew up in the mainland in the northern province of Hebei, was part of the Nationalist forces that fought Mao Zedongâs Communists in the Chinese Civil War. He retreated to Taiwan in 1949, four years before Ms. Tengâs birth.
Ms. Teng was one of the first foreign singers whose music flowed into China after it began opening its economy to the world in the late 1970s.
But her music was quickly banned as part of a campaign by the Communist government to block âspiritual pollutionâ from the West. The Taiwanese government used her music as a psychological weapon, blasting it from loudspeakers positioned near the mainland.
Tapes of Ms. Tengâs music circulated on a black market in the mainland, and her popularity was clear. Because of her surname, which in Chinese uses the same character as the Communist leader Deng Xiaopingâs, she was sometimes referred to as Little Deng, reflecting her hold on the public imagination.
Ms. Teng occasionally veered into politics, holding concerts to show solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters who gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. She never performed in the mainland.
In recent years, however, the government has warmed to her music, and the state-run media has celebrated her mainland roots.
In 2011, officials opened a memorial hall in honor of Ms. Teng in her fatherâs hometown, Daming, where fans now converge on the anniversary of her death.
The mainland has at least two restaurants devoted to Ms. Teng, including the one in Beijing, which is at the center of a struggling cultural development known as Taiwan Street.
Mr. Zheng, the owner, said Ms. Tengâs music was still popular in the mainland because it reminded people of hearing her songs for the first time in the years after the chaos of Maoâs Cultural Revolution.
âFor many people, it was a very new experience and very different from what they had heard in the Cultural Revolution,â he said. âNow when people hear it, they remember what it was like to be young.â
Ms. Teng has been hailed as a symbol of commonality between China and Taiwan at a time when relations have deteriorated, with President Xi Jinping of China recently warning that efforts by Taiwan to assert independence could be met by armed force.
But Mr. Zheng said he did not have politics in mind when he opened the restaurant. âMusic has no sense of borders,â he said.
The Beijing restaurant, which is officially recognized by Ms. Tengâs family in Taiwan, also includes a museum, on the first floor, displaying some of Ms. Tengâs dresses, pianos and clocks. On the second floor is the performance hall, with a chandelier and a disco ball.
On busy nights, hundreds of people pack into the hall, gathering around tables covered with red-checkered tablecloths. Some guests opt for private rooms, where they sing karaoke versions of Ms. Tengâs songs.
On a recent night, Wang Liang, 36, paid $15 to request a live performance of âI Only Care About Youâ for his wife and daughter.
âEver since I was a child, Iâve always liked Teresa Tengâs songs,â Mr. Wang said. âHer songs arenât as flippant as pop songs now, and they really stick in your memory.â
One of the singers at the restaurant, Wang Xin, 25, who was trained as a classical pianist, said Ms. Tengâs supple singing style, rich with vibrato, is difficult to imitate.
âThe emotions are hard to capture,â she said. âItâs very hard to find the right tone.â
She practices by listening to Ms. Tengâs songs on repeat on her phone.
At a recent show, Ms. Wang, wearing fake eyelashes and red lipstick to evoke Ms. Teng, approached the microphone to sing one of the pop starâs tougher standards, âWhat Do You Have to Say?â:

"Roderick MacFarquhar, Eminent China Scholar, Dies at 88","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245628804?accountid=14586,"Roderick MacFarquhar, a consummate scholar of Communist China whose writing on Maoâs power politics influenced how people around the world understood China, died on Sunday in Cambridge, Mass., where he had long taught at Harvard University. He was 88.
His son, Rory, said the cause was heart failure.
Professor MacFarquhar specialized in the origins of the Cultural Revolution, the decade of turmoil that terrorized China beginning in 1966. His three-volume work, âThe Origins of the Cultural Revolution,â came to be considered a classic.
The research for those books, which were based on dense official texts, public speeches and Maoâs own words, opened a world hidden to the West and illuminated an era of Chinaâs past that still seems almost unfathomable.
At Harvard, Professor MacFarquhar taught history and political science and was known for his wit and informality. In one class he asked his teaching assistants to pose as Red Guards, Maoâs paramilitary youth, and act out boisterous self-criticism sessions. He then coaxed the class to shout over and over, âMao Zedong, Wan Sui!â â â10,000 years for Mao!â â so that everyone felt the fervor of the movement that shook China. The âCultRevâ class packed the biggest lecture hall on campus.
âRod was a thinker â he studied big questions, and big ideas,â said Minxin Pei, a historian on China and one of his early students. âHe was very interested in political purges, and the Cultural Revolution was one of the biggest political purges ever.â
Unlike many historians who dwelled on the violence of the Red Guards after the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution, Professor MacFarquhar concentrated on the elite factional fighting that started in the 1950s.
He had worked as a journalist and served as a member of Parliament in Britain for five years in the 1970s, jobs that instructed him in the workings of politics.
By concentrating on Maoâs brutal political chess-playing, Mr. Pei said, Professor MacFarquhar helped illustrate the leaderâs state of mind and laid bare the calamity of the Cultural Revolution, which nearly ruined the country.
Though his work put China under hard scrutiny, and though he made clear that he thought some kind of democracy was best for the country, Professor MacFarquhar was not viewed as aiming to undermine the Communist Party.
He was able to keep contact with his peers in China, including academics and editors of the official government newspaper, Peopleâs Daily, when they visited the United States and streamed into his Harvard office, said Michael A. Szonyi, director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard, with which Professor MacFarquhar was long affiliated.
One Chinese professor, Tang Shaojie of Tsinghua University, who attended Professor MacFarquharâs lectures at Harvard in 2003, called him a âgiantâ in the study of Chinese history and noted that the study of the Cultural Revolution for many years had occurred outside China.
âAnd where was it studied? In the United States,â he said in a statement on Tuesday. âSpecifically at Harvard University. And more specifically by Professor MacFarquhar.â
Professor MacFarquhar was never barred from visiting China, though on one occasion he surprised his hosts at the Central Party School of the Communist Party by devoting his talk to sensitive topics.
âToday I am going to talk about two dates, May 4 and June 4,â he told the audience, who froze in silence, according to Mr. Pei. On May 4, 1919, students took to the streets of Beijing to denounce the government as unpatriotic. On June 4, 1989, troops who had shot their way into downtown Beijing broke up student protests at Tiananmen Square, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. After the lecture, his hosts calmly took Professor MacFarquhar to dinner, though they did not discuss the lecture, Mr. Pei said.
Professor MacFarquhar was director of the Fairbank Center from 1986 to 1992, and again from 2005 to 2006. Under his watch, the center attracted a diverse set of people curious about China â businessmen, diplomats, journalists â who sought debate as well as scholarship as an avenue to understanding a country that was increasingly important to the United States.
After the 1989 crackdown, he accepted Wang Dan, the student who had led the protests on Tiananmen Square, to study at the Fairbank Center.
He was âmy doctoral tutor, my closest teacher, the Westâs authoritative voice on the study of Chinaâs Cultural Revolution,â Professor Wang said on Monday.
The Chinese government allowed the first two volumes of Professor MacFarquharâs Cultural Revolution trilogy, covering 1956-1957 and 1958-60, to be translated into Chinese for publication in China in the 1980s.
By the time the last volume, covering 1961-66, came out in English in the late 1990s, the political atmosphere had soured in the aftermath of the Tiananmen protests, and the book never went to press in China.
Roderick Lemonde MacFarquhar was born on Dec. 2, 1930, in Lahore, then a major city in British-ruled India, the son of Sir Alexander and Berenice (Whitburn) MacFarquhar. His father was a member of the British Indian Civil Service.
Roderick made a first, fleeting trip to China at age 7 â visiting a snow-clad Great Wall â when he accompanied his parents on a round-the-world ship voyage. He went to a Scottish boarding school and graduated with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics from Keble College, Oxford University, in 1953.
Wanting to be a journalist, he briefly worked at The Telegraph of London. But to do well in journalism he believed he needed a specialty.
From his childhood, he knew a lot about India, and that seemed an obvious choice. However, âI felt too many people knew about it,â he said in an interview in 2017 posted by the University of Cambridge in England on its website.
The Communist revolution had recently occurred in China. âPeople would need to know about that,â he said, âso I would learn about China.â
He never, he said, âhad a misty feeling about Ming vases or anything like that.â
Professor MacFarquhar became affiliated with the Fairbank Center after its founder, Prof. John K. Fairbank, started taking a handful of students to study Chinese language, history and politics in 1955.
After receiving his masterâs degree in East Asian studies that year, Professor MacFarquhar went on to write his first book, on Maoâs Hundred Flowers Campaign of the mid-1950s, which had given intellectuals a brief period of greater freedom.
In 1960 he founded The China Quarterly, an academic journal on Chinese politics and economics published by the University of Cambridge. He briefly merged his two passions, politics and China, with a trip to China in 1972 as part of the entourage of the British foreign secretary, Alec Douglas-Home.
He was elected to Parliament as a Labour candidate in 1974 but was defeated in Margaret Thatcherâs conservative tide of 1979. He joined the Harvard faculty about five years later.
He died in a Cambridge hospital. In addition to his son, Rory, who is director of global economic policy at Google, Professor MacFarquhar is survived by his wife, Dalena Wright; a daughter, Larissa MacFarquhar, a writer for The New Yorker; and two granddaughters. His first wife, Emily Jane (Cohen) MacFarquhar, a journalist, died in 2001.
Professor MacFarquhar had in the last several years turned to writing a book on India. But he was always asked about China and its future. One thing seemed certain, he said: The Communist Party will not last forever.
âI do foresee the Communist Party fading,â he said in the 2017 interview. âHow it will happen Iâve not got the slightest idea. The idea that the party knows best, and only the party can rule, I think it will disappear. Whether it will disappear by some kind of new revolution or just gradually fade away, I donât know.â

Chinese and Iranian Hackers Renew Their Attacks on U.S. Companies,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245626762?accountid=14586,"SAN FRANCISCO â Businesses and government agencies in the United States have been targeted in aggressive attacks by Iranian and Chinese hackers who security experts believe have been energized by President Trumpâs withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal last year and his trade conflicts with China.
Recent Iranian attacks on American banks, businesses and government agencies have been more extensive than previously reported. Dozens of corporations and multiple United States agencies have been hit, according to seven people briefed on the episodes who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
The attacks, attributed to Iran by analysts at the National Security Agency and the private security firm FireEye, prompted an emergency order by the Department of Homeland Security during the government shutdown last month.
The Iranian attacks coincide with a renewed Chinese offensive geared toward stealing trade and military secrets from American military contractors and technology companies, according to nine intelligence officials, private security researchers and lawyers familiar with the attacks who discussed them on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.
A summary of an intelligence briefing read to The New York Times said that Boeing, General Electric Aviation and T-Mobile were among the recent targets of Chinese industrial-espionage efforts. The companies all declined to discuss the threats, and it is not clear if any of the hacks were successful.
Chinese cyberespionage cooled four years ago after President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China reached a landmark deal to stop hacks meant to steal trade secrets.
But the 2015 agreement appears to have been unofficially canceled amid the continuing trade tension between the United States and China, the intelligence officials and private security researchers said. Chinese hacks have returned to earlier levels, although they are now stealthier and more sophisticated.
âCyber is one of the ways adversaries can attack us and retaliate in effective and nasty ways that are well below the threshold of an armed attack or laws of war,â said Joel Brenner, a former leader of United States counterintelligence under the director of national intelligence.
Federal agencies and private companies are back to where they were five years ago: battling increasingly sophisticated, government-affiliated hackers from China and Iran â in addition to fighting constant efforts out of Russia â who hope to steal trade and military secrets and sow mayhem. And it appears the hackers substantially improved their skills during the lull.
Russia is still considered Americaâs foremost hacking adversary. In addition to meddling widely and spreading disinformation during United States elections, Russian hackers are believed to have launched attacks on nuclear plants, the electrical grid and other targets.
Threats from China and Iran never stopped entirely, but Iranian hackers became much less active after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015. And for about 18 months, intelligence officials concluded, Beijing backed off its 10-year online effort to steal trade secrets.
But Chinese hackers have resumed carrying out commercially motivated attacks, security researchers and data-protection lawyers said. A priority for the hackers, researchers said, is supporting Beijingâs five-year economic plan, which is meant to make China a leader in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies.
âSome of the recent intelligence collection has been for military purposes or preparing for some future cyber conflict, but a lot of the recent theft is driven by the demands of the five-year plan and other technology strategies,â said Adam Segal, the director of the cyberspace program at the Council on Foreign Relations. âThey always intended on coming back.â
Officials at the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Segal and other Chinese security experts said attacks that once would have been conducted by hackers in Chinaâs Peopleâs Liberation Army are now being run by Chinaâs Ministry of State Security.
These hackers are better at covering their tracks. Rather than going at targets directly, they have used a side door of sorts by breaking into the networks of the targetsâ suppliers. They have also avoided using malware commonly attributed to China, relying instead on encrypting traffic, erasing server logs and other obfuscation tactics.
âThe fingerprint of Chinese operations today is much different,â said Priscilla Moriuchi, who once ran the National Security Agencyâs East Asia and Pacific cyber threats division. Her duties there included determining whether Beijing was abiding by the 2015 agreementâs terms. âThese groups care about attribution. They donât want to get caught.â
It is difficult to quantify the number of industrial-espionage attacks, in part because they have been designed mostly to steal strategic trade secrets, not the kind of personal information about customers and employees that companies must disclose. Only Airbus has acknowledged in recent weeks that Chinese hackers had penetrated its databases.
Many of the attacks by the Chinese Ministry of State Security have been against strategic targets like internet service providers with access to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of corporate and government networks.
Last week, Ms. Moriuchi, who is now a threat director at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, released a report on a yearlong, stealth campaign by the ministry to hack internet service providers in Western Europe and the United States and their customers.
The lone hacking target to publicly confront the ministry was Visma, a Norwegian internet service provider with 850,000 customers. The goal of the attack on Visma was to gain broad access to its customersâ intellectual property, strategic plans and emails, including those of an American law firm that handles intellectual property matters for clients in the automotive, biomedical, pharmaceutical and tech sectors, according to Recorded Future.
The Visma attack was harder to trace than earlier incidents, which typically started with so-called spearphishing emails meant to steal personal credentials. This assault began with stolen credentials for a third-party software service, Citrix. And instead of using malware easily traced to China, the attackers used malware available on the so-called Dark Web that could have come from anywhere. They also used the online storage service Dropbox to move stolen emails and files.
Federal agencies are also trying to fend off new Iranian espionage campaigns.
After the Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, testified before Congress that her agency was âanticipating itâs a possibilityâ that Iran would resort to hacking attacks.
The Iranian attacks, which hit more than a half-dozen federal agencies last month, still caught the department off guard. Security researchers said the hacks, which exploited underlying weaknesses in the internetâs backbone, were continuing and were more damaging and widespread than agency officials had acknowledged.
Iranian hackers began their latest wave of attacks in Persian Gulf states last year. Since then, they have expanded to 80 targets â including internet service providers, telecommunications companies and government agencies â in 12 European countries and the United States, according to researchers at FireEye, which first reported the attacks last month.
The current hacks are harder to catch than previous Iranian attacks. Instead of hitting victims directly, FireEye researchers said, Iranian hackers have been going after the internetâs core routing system, intercepting traffic between so-called domain name registrars. Once they intercepted their targetâs customer web traffic, they used stolen login credentials to gain access to their victimsâ emails. (Domain name registrars hold the keys to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of companiesâ websites.)
âTheyâre taking whole mailboxes of data,â said Benjamin Read, a senior manager of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye. Mr. Read said Iranian hackers had targeted police forces, intelligence agencies and foreign ministries, indicating a classic, state-backed espionage campaign rather than a criminal, profit-seeking motive.
There is a long history of Iranian attacks against the United States, and episodes from five years back or longer are just now being made public.
On Wednesday, the Justice Department announced an indictment against a former Air Force intelligence specialist, Monica Witt, on charges of helping Iran with an online espionage campaign. Four members of Iranâs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were also charged with âcomputer intrusions and aggravated identity theftâ directed at members of the United States intelligence community.
Also last week, the Treasury said it was putting sanctions on two Iranian companies, New Horizon Organization and Net Peygard Samavat Company, and several people linked to them. Treasury officials said New Horizon set up annual conferences where Iran could recruit and collect intelligence from foreign attendees.
Ms. Witt attended one of the conferences, the indictment says. Net Peygard used information she provided to begin a campaign in 2014 to track the online activities of United States government and military personnel, Treasury officials said.
Representatives for Iranâs Mission to the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment.
The recent Iranian attacks have unnerved American officials. But after issuing the emergency order about the ones last month, the Department of Homeland Securityâs Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has largely played them down.
An official with the cybersecurity agency said there was a belief that no information had been stolen and that the attacks had not âmaterially impactedâ operations. But Mr. Read of FireEye and others said there had been a noticeable escalation in Iranâs digital espionage.
âIf you tell the Iranians youâre going to walk out on the agreement and do everything you can to undermine their government,â said Mr. Brenner, the former counterintelligence official, âyou canât be surprised if they attack our government networks.â

"Live From Americaâs Capital, a TV Station Run by Chinaâs Communist Party","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245532243?accountid=14586,"It broadcasts forced confessions to American audiences. It avoids subjects that displease Beijing. It cuts away when wind musses the hair of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
China Global Television Network America, which reaches 30 million households in the United States, is an arm of Chinaâs propaganda machine. It is controlled by the Communist Party and serves as part of what Mr. Xi has called Beijingâs âpublicity front.â
But when the American authorities asked about those ties, CGTN America argued that the Chinese government doesnât tell it what to broadcast.
That contention, made last month in a filing with the United States Department of Justice, may not get a warm reception in Washington. In the wake of Russian influence in the 2016 election, American officials are trying to get a clearer picture of efforts by China and other countries to build influence in the United States. The claim by CGTN America, an overtly state-owned organization, represents a direct challenge to that effort.
âThey have put the Department of Justice into a position of looking utterly ridiculous and toothless if it simply walks away from this type of false claim,â said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.
âThis is right up there with Pravda claiming to be a health magazine,â he added, referring to the onetime official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. âOn its face, it doesnât hold.â
CGTN America, based in Washington, is part of the international arm of China Central Television, Beijingâs main domestic propaganda organ. It runs a typical newsroom except when it comes to stories about China, said four current and former employees, who asked for anonymity to protect their careers. Some stories, like the 2012 escape from China of the activist lawyer Chen Guangcheng or 2014 protests in Hong Kong calling for freer elections, were covered only briefly days after the news broke, three of them said.
Employees were rebuked when a report mentioned Falun Gong, the religious group that Beijing considers a cult, they said. Images of the flag of Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims, are banned from broadcasts.
CGTN made the filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, at the urging of the Justice Department. FARA requires those doing publicity work for foreign-controlled groups to submit government disclosures.
American officials have stepped up their requests that foreign-controlled groups make FARA filings in response to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Two years ago RT America, a Russian-backed broadcaster, made a similar filing at the urging of the Justice Department.
Chinese companies and organizations in general have come under greater scrutiny as the trade war has intensified, including the deals they strike to buy up American firms and technology. Some American officials contend the companies can pose a security risk.
As part of its demands that CGTN America make a filing under FARA, the Justice Department in a December letter to the broadcaster said it put Mr. Xi in a positive light and had attempted to influence the American public during the recent trade dispute.
âReporting Chinaâs policy positions and presenting them in a positive light are primary reasons for CGTNâs existence,â the letter said.
CGTN America did not respond to emailed requests for comment. American officials sometimes challenge filings, requiring registrants to disclose more data about their relationships with foreign governments.
Unlike the Russian influence campaign, which is designed to split Americans, the Chinese propaganda effort tends toward the sunny side. Recent broadcasts on CGTN America extolled traditional Chinese medicine and Chinaâs economic rise, while its website offers a link to its panda coverage.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Chinaâs influence push may be ham-handed compared with Russiaâs, but it is well funded. Official Chinese media spend heavily to advertise on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter that are banned within China. China Daily, an English-language, state-controlled newspaper, buys advertising inserts in American newspapers, including The New York Times.
Based in a glassy office building four blocks from the White House, CGTN America employs about 180 journalists â many of them Americans â devoted to covering the United States. It broadcasts seven hours of programming a day through cable and satellite providers like AT&T and Comcast. Its employees cover a wide variety of topics, from news to features to business, and occasionally win awards for their coverage.
Ma Jing, CGTN Americaâs director general, said the broadcaster âenjoys editorial independence from any state direction or control.â
âCGTN America is not engaged in âpolitical activities,â as that term is defined for purposes of FARA, and has elected to file this registration statement out of an abundance of caution and in the spirit of cooperation with U.S. authorities,â Ms. Ma wrote in the filing with the Justice Departmentâs National Security Division.
Current and former CGTN employees say CCTV editors in Beijing often dictated plans for covering China. American employees sometimes pushed back, they said, and Ms. Ma allowed some flexibility when Beijingâs orders didnât specifically forbid or dictate content. But three people interviewed said they had little choice but to air propaganda clips when Beijing said so.
For instance, in November CGTN America was told to broadcast a piece that played down Chinaâs imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of members of the Uighur ethnic minority group. The Times and others have reported that the mostly Muslim Uighurs are held against their will, often in dismal conditions, and subject to an indoctrination program designed to discourage Islam.
The piece that aired portrayed the camps as successful vocational training and antiterrorism centers and Uighurs as grateful. CGTN America employees packaged the clips with context citing international criticism, but the video nonetheless ran, at times without their framing.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Other times there was less recourse. CGTN has broadcast the televised confessions of people accused of a wide variety of crimes in China, with those confessions sometimes touted internally as âexclusivesâ by editors, one former employee said. Human rights groups say China forces people to make false, televised confessions to serve its own propaganda needs.
CGTN broadcast the confession of Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator who was imprisoned in China in 2013 and accused of illegally obtaining and selling Chinese citizensâ data.
Mr. Humphrey, who has since been released, said he had been drugged, chained to a chair, locked in a cage and then made to read out a statement written by the police in front of the cameras. The anchor who presented the footage, James Chau, is now a goodwill ambassador with the World Health Organization. He declined to comment.
The news organization âcollaborates with the security and police organs to extract forced confessions from prisoners under extreme conditions of duress,â Mr. Humphrey said, adding that the confession was packaged to âdistort reality, intrude on privacy and fairness, and humiliate me.â
Chinese leaders get different treatment, said three current or former employees. During a 2014 visit by Mr. Xi to Greece, a clip that showed him getting off the plane with unruly hair was eradicated from broadcasts, one current employee said.
One CGTN America show, âThe Heat,â is occasionally edited if it is too critical of China, two of the people said.
âCGTN wouldnât exist or have any significant funding if it werenât for the Chinese government,â said Sarah Cook, a senior analyst for East Asia at Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group in the United States. âAnd of course that comes with editorial strings attached.â
The Chinese governmentâs power over CGTN was underscored by a 2016 event at state media facilities in Beijing in which Mr. Xi said official media and publicity broadly were âcrucial for the partyâs path.â
A group of CGTN employees in Washington attended via video conference. They had been kept after midnight several days in advance to prepare, without being told why, according to two of the people. When Mr. Xi greeted them, the group waved and, in a rehearsed moment, called out in unison, âGood morning, President Xi.â The moment became a source of tension internally, these people said.
âMedia analysts say this is very much about cultivating a more robust image for the Chinese leader,â the CGTN America anchor Roee Ruttenberg said in the channelâs coverage of Mr. Xiâs appearance, âthrough all of the different outlets that in theory fall under his control.â

"Chinese Entrepreneur Takes On the System, and Drops Out of Sight","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245493347?accountid=14586,"YULIN, China â For months, Zhao Faqi was a folk hero for entrepreneurs in China â an investor who fought the government in court and online, and against the odds, seemed poised to win. He accused officials of stealing his rights to coal-rich land, and ignited a furor by accusing Chinaâs most powerful judge of corruption.
Now, Mr. Zhao has dropped out of sight â and the authorities want to erase his story.
For much of the winter, Mr. Zhaoâs case was the subject of avid discussion on Chinese social media, and his supporters saw it as a test of whether the president and Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, would support the troubled private sector against grasping officials.
Now, as the Communist Party-controlled legislature gathers for its annual meeting in Beijing, it seems the authorities have decided that investors like Mr. Zhao spell trouble.
The state news media has painted him as a cunning schemer. A judge who supported his case was paraded on television. A crusading former talk show host who helped bring the case to light has fallen silent.
Mr. Zhaoâs arc from self-declared victim to officially designated villain has been dramatic even for China, where the party controls the courts and businesspeople can abruptly fall from grace. Mr. Zhaoâs descent â and possible disappearance â is a demonstration of the hazards that entrepreneurs face in taking on powerful Chinese officials.
âIâve faced a lot of risks and pressure because of this lawsuit,â Mr. Zhao said in an interview in Beijing a few weeks before he disappeared. Chinese entrepreneurs, he said, yearned for the rule of law to replace arbitrary power. âYou canât say someone is protected one day, and take away protection the next day.â
Mr. Zhao drew support from liberal economists and lawyers who have been unsettled by Mr. Xiâs reverence for communist tradition and support for state-owned companies, which he has urged to grow âstronger, better and bigger.â
The gloom prompted Mr. Xi to publicly reassure the private sector at least three times in a month that the leadership remained committed to its success. In early November, he also took the rare step of admitting that the government had gone too far.
âIt should be acknowledged that the private sector is experiencing difficulties that are real, and even quite severe,â Mr. Xi said at a meeting with more than 50 selected businesspeople. âPrivate businesses and businesspeople are one of us.â
Such reassurances may now mean little to Mr. Zhao.
A former soldier, Mr. Zhao went into business after quitting his job for a supplies company in 1991. He made his fortune as a construction contractor and later plowed his earnings into the mining investment.
Mr. Zhao, 52, was among the entrepreneurs who plunged into business after Deng Xiaoping, then Chinaâs paramount leader, unleashed market overhauls. At the time, Mr. Zhao said, entrepreneurs were like famished goats set free from a pen and allowed to flourish.
âBut weâre seeing this vitality steadily shrink,â he said.
Since 2005, he has been fighting for the right to explore more than 100 square miles of sandy, scrub-covered land on the fringe of Yulin, a coal-rich city in Shaanxi Province. After initial surveys indicated that the land was abundant in coal, the mining institute that had sold an 80 percent share of exploration rights to Mr. Zhaoâs company canceled the contract, citing government orders.
Mr. Zhao waged a legal fight that took him all the way to Chinaâs top court, the Supreme Peopleâs Court.
His chances of victory seemed slim. In China, judges answer to the party. While courts have greater autonomy than before in business disputes, they often rule in favor of officials and their allies.
Still, in late 2017, the Supreme Peopleâs Court ruled that Mr. Zhaoâs contract was valid.
But officials made no effort to enforce the ruling.
Then, late last year, something unusual happened.
Cui Yongyuan, a former Chinese television talk show host with a massive internet following, took up Mr. Zhaoâs cause, fueling an uproar in the Chinese news media, which was largely sympathetic.
Mr. Cui said that files from the case had vanished from the Supreme Peopleâs Court. He also revealed that a disgruntled judge on the court, Wang Linqing, claimed that Chinaâs top judge, Zhou Qiang, tried to ensure that judges did not rule in Mr. Zhaoâs favor.
Mr. Cui shared excerpts from interviews with Judge Wang on Sina Weibo, a social media service where he has nearly 20 million followers. The judge anxiously described how files from Mr. Zhaoâs case had vanished from his office.
âThis is something that I never imagined would happen,â Judge Wang said in one of the excerpts.
When the Supreme Peopleâs Court acknowledged a problem and party investigators opened a high-level inquiry, Mr. Zhao was cautiously hopeful.
âItâs progress toward the rule of law,â Mr. Zhao said in an interview at the time. âBut the outcome is unclear.â
Mr. Zhao was right to be cautious. Earlier this month, the government released the findings from the investigation, and they were damning for him and his supporters.
The investigators said that Judge Wang himself had spirited away the missing case files. A report aired on official Chinese television showed him confessing that he had nursed grudges against more senior judges and tried to take revenge by stealing the files to create an embarrassing scandal.
âI offer my heartfelt apologies to the many internet usersâ who followed the case, Judge Wang said. âMy behavior amounted to swindling their well-meaning hearts.â
Supporters said that they were worried that Mr. Zhao and Judge Wangâs real offense was rocking the political boat. They were especially shocked that Judge Wang was shown on television avowing himself guilty of breaking the law even before a formal investigation by the police, joining the ranks of dissidents and rights lawyers who have been forced to record scripted confessions while in detention.
âThe official reports are full of problems, and the biggest one is how Judge Wang Linqing was made to confess on television,â said Sheng Hong, executive director of the Unirule Institute of Economics, a think tank in Beijing that backs market liberalization and previously held a forum about Mr. Zhaoâs case.
Since the findings were released, Mr. Zhaoâs phone has been turned off, and he appears to have gone into hiding or official custody. Judge Wang faces a criminal investigation and a likely prison sentence.
The supreme court, Ministry of Public Security and other government offices did not answer questions about whether Mr. Zhao was detained, and his family could not be reached. Zhou Qiang, the top judge whom Mr. Zhao accused of corruption, has attended the legislative meeting in Beijing, apparently unshaken by the accusations.
Still, Chinese lawyers have said online that the findings in the official report defied logic. Was it believable, they asked, that Judge Wang turned on his superiors because he did not want to do overtime one night, as the report had claimed? It also failed to address in detail Judge Wangâs claims of being repeatedly intimidated by senior judges, critics said online.
âFrom the viewpoint of common sense, many things about this are just hard to swallow,â said Liu Xiaoyuan, a human rights lawyer. âBut itâs also shocking to think that a high-level investigation like this would just make all this up.â

"Muslim Detention Camps Are Like âBoarding Schools,â Chinese Official Says","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245490505?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â A senior official from Chinaâs far west said on Tuesday that the internment camps for Muslim minorities there were like boarding schools and that their numbers of inmates would shrink, as the government pushed back against international criticism of the mass detentions.
Chinaâs sweeping confinement of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region has drawn condemnation from foreign governments and international bodies, including in recent weeks. A United States envoy called it part of a âwar with faith.â Turkey, once quiet about the detentions, has become critical. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights recently demanded answers.
Yet at the annual meeting of Chinaâs national legislature, which began last month, Communist Party officials from Xinjiang appeared serenely unbowed about the policies.
Foreign experts, citing satellite images and government documents, have estimated that the camps have held without trial as many as a million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in a program that tries to turn them into loyal, Chinese-speaking supporters of the party.
In a meeting room jammed with foreign and Chinese journalists, the chairman of the Xinjiang government, Shohrat Zakir, dismissed that estimate, but did not say how many inmates they held.
âSome voices internationally have said Xinjiang has concentration camps or re-education camps. These claims are pure lies,â Mr. Zakir said at the gathering of Xinjiang delegates of the Communist Party-controlled legislature, the National Peopleâs Congress, which was opened to journalists.
âIn fact, our centers are like boarding schools where the students eat and live for free,â Mr. Zakir said, using their official name, âeducational training centers.â
He indicated that the camps could eventually be phased out, but did not say how long that might take.
âOver all, the education training centers will have fewer and fewer people, and if one day society doesnât need them, these centers can gradually disappear,â Mr. Zakir said.
Since last year, Mr. Zakir, a Uighur, has served as one of the governmentâs most prominent defenders of Beijingâs offensive against Islamic religious activities and ethnic dissent in Xinjiang. In October, he was the first Chinese official to defend in detail the mass detentions.
Adrian Zenz, a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany whose research concluded that the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang could hold a million or more inmates, said that the facilities worked under at least eight names, and not just the training centers that Mr. Zakir mentioned.
âIn my view, it might well be as high as 1.5 million,â he said of the population held for indoctrination. âThere is virtually no Uighur family without one or more members in such detention, and a rising number of Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities are likewise affected.â
Mr. Zakirâs latest remarks underscored how the Chinese government has been unmoved by the global criticism of its policies, and confident that its propaganda drive of closely supervised visits to Xinjiang by selected diplomats and journalists could blunt the condemnation.
The press event on Tuesday was part of that propaganda effort. Held in the Xinjiang room at the imposing Great Hall of the People, the gathering featured around 60 officials, including some from the Uighur, Hui, Tatar and Mongolian ethnic minorities, sitting before a floor-to-ceiling painting of a snowy mountain scene from the region.
Over the nearly two-hour session, the officials took turns to praise Chinaâs leader, Xi Jinping, and the partyâs drive to eradicate poverty, invigorate the local economy and attract tourists to the region. They often invoked the pomegranate, the multi-seeded fruit that the government treats as a symbol of ethnic harmony.
One official described how policies to improve waste sorting and install modern toilets had helped transform a village.
âOur lives are getting better day by day,â said Chen Liang, the local official. âFor all of these good things, we really have to thank Xi Jinping and the party.â
Such arguments resonate with many Chinese people but were unlikely to stem the global criticism, which has drawn on accounts from former camp inmates and extensive research documenting how hundreds of detention camps have expanded across Xinjiang since 2017.
The Uighurs are a Turkic people who share traditions and language traits with Islamic populations across Central Asia and Turkey. Last month, the Turkish Foreign Ministry accused China of the âreintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st centuryâ and called policies in Xinjiang a violation of the âfundamental human rightsâ of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.
The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, kept up the criticism later in February.
âWhile recognizing Chinaâs right to combat terrorism, we think that a distinction should be made between terrorists and innocent people,â Mr. Cavusoglu said at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said she wanted independent access to investigate reports of âenforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions,â especially in Xinjiang.
Sam Brownback, the United Statesâ ambassador at large for international religious freedom, has been much blunter. âWe need to call these camps what they are; theyâre internment camps created to wipe out the cultural and religious identity of minority communities,â Mr. Brownback told journalists in Hong Kong last week.
But in a possible sign of Chinaâs influence, some activists abroad who have denounced the internments in Xinjiang have come under growing pressure.
Serikzhan Bilash, the founder of an organization in Kazakhstan that helps ethnic Kazakhs who have fled neighboring Xinjiang, was detained on Sunday in Almaty.
He was placed under house arrest for two months in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, and was being investigated on suspicion of âinciting ethnic hatred,â his lawyer, Aiman Umarova, said by telephone.
In Beijing, Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, remained mostly silent in the presence of reporters. Mr. Chen is the chief enforcer of tough policies in the region, but he let Mr. Zakir do most of the talking. The Xinjiang police often follow and restrict foreign journalists who visit the region, but Mr. Chen struck a different note in his brief opening comments.
âI express my sincere thanks to Chinese and foreign reporters for their longstanding interest in Xinjiang,â Mr. Chen said.

China Asserts Its Air Safety Bona Fides After Boeing Crash,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245505197?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Once known for its deadly skies, China doubled down on aviation safety as it grew in wealth and power.
This week, as it took the lead among world governments in grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8, China showed its willingness to assert itself in airline safety.
Chinese regulators acted swiftly on Monday, grounding 96 of the 737 Max 8 jetliners operated by Chinese carriers less than 20 hours after one operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed on Sunday. It was less than five months after a similar deadly accident involving that model.
Although dozens of other governments, from Indonesia to France, also banned the flights after Chinaâs decision, it was not until Wednesday that the United States said it would also do so.
That is a big shift from a generation ago, when Chinese regulators largely followed the Federal Aviation Administrationâs lead. Today, Chinese airlines are among the safest in the world, according to industry statistics.
âIn the past, we mainly acted according to F.A.A.âs decision,â said Lin Zhijie, an aviation consultant in the southeastern city of Xiamen. âIf F.A.A. said âground,â weâd ground, and vice versa.â
Beijing regulatorsâ willingness to act on their own now, Mr. Lin said, âis a landmark event, and worth watching.â
Investigators are beginning to explore what caused the Ethiopian Airlines crash, which killed 157 people. It is not clear whether the Max 8 has a fatal safety flaw. But the Chinese airline industry said the precautionary move was a sign of its commitment to safety.
âChina Eastern Airlines has 14 Max 8 planes, and we have already suspended all of them,â Liu Shaoyong, the airlineâs president, said this week as governments and other carriers were still deciding how to react.
âOur primary concern is for the safety of lives and to maintain a strong sense of responsibility,â he said.
The challenge for China will be whether it can sustain its improved safety record as its airline sector continues to grow. In its annual market forecast, Boeing predicted that China would make up nearly one-fifth of global air traffic by 2037, compared with about 14 percent now â an expansion that will require purchasing thousands of planes and training legions of new pilots.
Concerns over training linger. This week, Li Jian, the deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, cited uncertainties over whether pilots could fly planes manually if they were to encounter problems with automated systems.
The cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is not yet clear. But the groundings were driven in part by regulatorsâ concerns about similarities to a deadly accident in October, when a Max 8 flown by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia, killing 189 people. Preliminary inquiries into that crash suggested that a combination of poorly maintained flight instruments and a balky automated flight system might have played a role.
Chinese airlines have done extra training with the automated flight control system since the Lion Air crash.
âOur pilots have the ability to deal with it â we could simply shut down the computer intervention,â said Noa Sun, a pilot in China of Boeing 737s, although he has not yet flown the Max 8 version of the plane. He also cautioned that, if there was a problem, no pilot would have much time to react.
China has broad ambitions to compete with the United States and Europe in the business of flying airliners. The country is building its own jets, with long-term ambitions to compete with Boeing and with Airbus, the European aerospace giant. China makes airliner electronics equipment and is developing its own jet engines. And its executives now play major roles in international air transport organizations.
That increased global participation includes airline safety. The International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations specialized agency that coordinates global aviation regulations, chose a Chinese regulator as its secretary general for the first time in 2015. The regulator, Fang Liu, an aviation law expert who long worked for Chinaâs main flight regulatory agency, was reappointed last year to a second three-year term.
Some of these ambitions have raised concerns within the Trump administration because the line between civil and military technology can blur quickly in the aviation business.
For example, the China Aviation Industry Corporation, a state-owned enterprise better known as AVIC, has become a big producer of commercial aircraft components for Boeing. It also makes some of the worldâs most advanced stealth fighter jets for the Chinese Air Force. The Trump administration put some kinds of aircraft equipment, like jet engines, in the initial 25 percent tariffs that it imposed last summer on $50 billion a year of goods imported from China.
China has not always been so self-confident in international aviation. A spate of deadly crashes in the 1990s, including seven from 1992 to 1994 that killed a total of 492 people, prompted China to turn to the F.A.A. for help. The F.A.A. sent advisers and provided voluminous information on how it regulated practically every detail of aircraft operations in the United States.
Chinese regulators successfully adopted the same procedures. While other fast-growing economies in middle-income countries have had periodic crashes, China has not had a major crash since 2010. That was when an Embraer ERJ-190LR, imported from Brazil and operated by Henan Airlines, crashed and burned while trying to land on a foggy runway in northeastern China. The crash killed 44 of the 96 people aboard.
Some of the ways China keeps its skies safe are familiar â sometimes, annoyingly so â to frequent fliers. Even in good weather, Chinese airports do not let planes take off or land as quickly in succession as many airports in the West. When thunderstorms threaten, they space out the takeoffs and landings even more. Sometimes air traffic controllers tell pilots to land somewhere else. Long delays lead to frequent stories in the Chinese media of frustrated passengers who start fights or open an emergency door for fresh air. But the measures help keep fliers safe.
China passed the United States in 2005 as the worldâs biggest market for the delivery of new commercial jets and has never looked back. But while China initially imported almost everything for its commercial aviation sector, it is working hard to learn how to make planes and equipment itself.
Airbus now assembles dozens of A320 jets, a competitor to the Boeing 737 although not the most advanced version, at an assembly plant in the Chinese port city of Tianjin. AVIC entered a joint venture with General Electric eight years ago to manufacture some of the worldâs most sophisticated aircraft electronics.
A lavishly financed state-owned enterprise, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac, has developed a single-aisle passenger jet, the C919. Near Shanghaiâs main international airport, Comac has a sprawling, brand-new campus of more than 110 buildings, some of which are designed for the simultaneous assembly of numerous aircraft.
The C919 had its first test flight two years ago. Comac had more than 500 orders for the plane before that flight even took off, although almost all of them were from Chinese state-controlled airlines. Comac is scheduled to start delivering the aircraft to the state-controlled carrier China Eastern, its first customer, in 2021.
The 158-seat aircraft is designed to compete with Airbusâs A320neo and with Boeingâs 737 Max series.
Chinese officials say their cooperation with airline regulators elsewhere shows their willingness to be part of the international aviation community. They also cite their emphasis on safety, the same factor that led Chinese regulators to ground the Max 8.
âThatâs our attitude, to ensure safety and be responsible for the people,â said Wang Yu, the president of Spring Airlines, a budget carrier.

This Chinese Christian Was Charged With Trying to Subvert the State,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245481205?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â In 2006, three Chinese Christians traveled to Washington to ask President George W. Bush for his support in their fight for religious freedom. One of them had converted to the faith only a few months earlier: Wang Yi, a 33-year-old lawyer from the southwestern city of Chengdu.
But Mr. Wang had already become such a prominent Christian that organizers made sure he went to the White House. A nationally known essayist and civil rights lawyer, he would soon found a 500-member church that was independent of government control, along with a seminary, an elementary school and even a group to aid the families of political prisoners â all illegal but which he accomplished by sheer force of will.
Today, Mr. Wang, now 45, is back in the spotlight, this time at the center of an intense crackdown on Christianity. His Early Rain Covenant Church and others like it are popular among Chinaâs growing middle class and have resisted government control, testing the ruling Communist Partyâs resolve to bring Chinaâs churches to heel.
âHe saw an inevitable fight with the government because of it trying to control the churches,â said Enoch Wang, a pastor based in the United States who has met Wang Yi many times. âHe knows that sooner or later theyâll come for you and so thereâs no point in trying to hide.â
That was one reason Wang Yi has in recent years become a vocal critic of President Xi Jinpingâs moves toward authoritarianism.
Last December, he and 100 church members were detained. Although most have been released, Mr. Wang, his wife and 11 others are still being held incommunicado without access to a lawyer.
The charges against Mr. Wang and his wife â inciting to subvert state power â typically result in lengthy prison sentences. The same charge was used to sentence Liu Xiaobo, a dissident, to 11 years in prison in 2009. He was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and died in custody in 2017.
According to church members who were detained and subsequently released, the police are also investigating Mr. Wang and two junior pastors for economic crimes such as whether they broke Chinese law by publishing books and DVDs without government approval.
Many congregants who have been released have lost their jobs and housing over their church membership. Others have been sent back to their hometowns or had their bank accounts frozen. Mr. Wangâs 11-year-old son now lives with his 74-year-old grandmother.
The crackdown is part of a broader effort to subdue Chinaâs fast-growing religious groups. This includes detaining a million minority Muslims in internment camps in Chinaâs far west, a drive that has drawn international condemnation.
But while Islam is practiced by about 20 million non-Chinese minorities in largely far-off provinces, Protestant Christianity is followed by about 60 million ethnic Chinese in Chinaâs economic heartland. About half worship in churches that raise their own money and run their own affairs.
In the past, many of these were called underground churches, but over the past decade, some have become public megachurches. Run by well-educated white-collar professionals in Chinaâs biggest cities, the churches own property and have nationwide alliances â something anathema to the party, which tightly restricts nongovernmental organizations.
Also targeted in the crackdown were the 1,500-member Zion Church in Beijing, which was closed in September, and the Rongguili Church in Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshipers each week.
Unlike the old underground churches, these independent churches wanted to be public.
âThey want to be the city on the hill,â said Fredrik Fallman, a professor at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who studies contemporary Chinese Christianity. âBut this is the basic fear of the Communist Party â people organized independent of the party in a structured way.â
Since Mr. Xi took power in 2012, the party has ramped up efforts to promote ideas such as the glory of traditional China and respect for authority.
Christians like Mr. Wang have challenged this top-down ideology. Many are interested in socially engaged models of Christianity, especially the Protestant denomination of Calvinism.
âTraditionally, Christians in China were mainly concerned with saving peopleâs souls,â said Yu Jie, an exiled essayist who helped convert Mr. Wang in 2005. âBut Wang Yi and others like us, we donât think the world is hopelessly corrupt. We want to improve it, and so thereâs an emphasis on issues like public service and justice.â
Born in 1973, Mr. Wang grew up in the rural Chinese county of Santai. He met his wife in elementary school â and wrote in an essay that he was immediately infatuated with her.
He was 16 when the government crushed pro-democracy protesters near Tiananmen Square in Beijing. That event shaped his life, pushing him to a career in law and an interest in justice.
All of this meant his church was unusually active in sensitive areas.
It set up a group that helped the families of political prisoners by regularly visiting them and paying their childrenâs college tuition. The church also helped fund a homeless shelter and protested the ubiquitous use of abortion in Chinese family planning.
Mr. Wang, a pastor, also held prayer services for the victims of the June 4, 1989, massacre of the Tiananmen protesters. In one widely circulated photo, he is wearing his pastorâs collar and holding a sign that says, âJune 4. Pray for the Country.â
He also became a sharp critic of Mr. Xi, especially after presidential term limits were lifted last year, allowing him to serve a third term and to potentially rule for life.
In response, Mr. Wang circulated a message calling Mr. Xi a âusurperâ who was ânot amending the Constitution but destroying it.â
Some in his congregation objected to his overtly political message. Two years ago, another pastor left Early Rain to start his own church, criticizing some of Mr. Wangâs statements as stunts. But others in the church thought they were necessary.
Mr. Wangâs bluntness made him one of the most polarizing figures in Chinese Christianity. When the government began reducing the public face of Christianity in one province by tearing crosses off the steeples of even government-run churches, Mr. Wang expressed no sympathy for the churches affected. Instead, he said their pastors were wrong for serving in churches controlled by the government.
Mr. Yu, the writer, said he wondered if his old friend was wise in confronting the government so openly.
âAs a pastor, you do have a responsibility to protect your members,â Mr. Yu said. âGiven the conditions in China, itâs something one can consider.â
But Mr. Wang had long anticipated his detention over the question of state control.
In a 2017 sermon, he asked his congregation what he should do if the government demanded even limited control over their church: Should he agree and avoid persecution, or resist?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
He joked that some people might ask him if he couldnât make a few compromises.
âWeâve got an 80-year-old grandma at home and we just had a child!â he said, anticipating the argument.
But then Mr. Wang argued against this sort of accommodation.
âIn this world, in this crooked, depraved and perverse world, how do we demonstrate that we are a group of people who trust in Jesus?â he said. âIt is through bodily submission, through bodily suffering, that we demonstrate the freedom of our souls.â

A Chinese Law Professor Criticized Xi. Now Heâs Been Suspended.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245445546?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â One of Chinaâs most prestigious universities has suspended a law professor and placed him under investigation after he published a series of essays that warned of deepening repression under President Xi Jinping, he said on Tuesday.
Professor Xu Zhangrun, of Tsinghua University in Beijing, shot to prominence last year when he published a passionate essay in July that was a rare rebuke of Mr. Xiâs rule. The essay denounced Mr. Xiâs authoritarian tendencies as driving China back to closed, repressive politics that could prove disastrous for the country.
In spite of censorship, the essay spread in China, capturing a current of disquiet about the direction of the country. Professor Xu received warnings, but he kept publishing pieces that criticized the authoritiesâ intolerance of dissent.
Now, as if to prove Professor Xuâs point, the ruling Communist Party seems to want to silence him.
His fate will be closely watched as a measure of how far the party under Mr. Xi will go in tightening restrictions over Chinese academic life, which is already heavily controlled. Since Mr. Xi came to power as party leader in 2012, he has taken particular aim at legal ideas, like constitutional limits on power, that he warned could be used to weaken party control.
In a series of mobile phone messages, Professor Xu said that several Tsinghua University officials ordered him on Monday to stop all teaching and research and told him his pay would be cut drastically. He said a university âwork teamâ would investigate him, focusing on the essays he had written since July.
He said he was questioned for one and a half hours by the officials.
âI donât know what theyâll do next,â he said. âIâve been mentally preparing for this for a long time. At the worst, I could end up in prison.â
Professor Xuâs suspension could ripple beyond the leafy Tsinghua campus in northwest Beijing. The university is one of Chinaâs most internationally reputable; it hosts many foreign academics, as well as Schwarzman College, founded by Stephen A. Schwarzman, a Wall Street financier. Mr. Xi himself studied at Tsinghua, as have many other senior officials.
âA spirit independent, a mind unfettered,â says an old Tsinghua motto.
The investigation into Professor Xu, 56, could be used as a warning against any potential dissent, said Geremie R. BarmÃ©, an Australian Sinologist who has translated Professor Xuâs essays.
âXu has repeatedly spoken out with eloquence, humor and devastating candor,â Mr. BarmÃ© said by email. âTsinghua University has now determined that such poisonous thinking must not infect the student body.â
Last year, the Communist Party launched a âpatriotic educationâ drive seeking to ensure that academics and universities conform to party values, but that effort fizzled while the leadership focused on external worries. Professor Xu could now be used as an example to revive that campaign, Mr. BarmÃ© said.
Offices reached at the Tsinghua University law school said they had not heard about Professor Xuâs suspension. A professor there, Zhang Jianwei, said by phone that Professor Xu had not been suspended and could still teach. But Professor Xu insisted that was incorrect and that word of his suspension may not have reached other colleagues.
Even so, the word had spread among his friends and supporters in Beijing and abroad, prompting denunciations. Zhang Yihe, a writer in Beijing, said she and other liberal intellectuals wanted to speak out in the hope that Professor Xu could be protected from worse punishment.
âXu Zhangrunâs hardships arenât unique to him,â Ms. Zhang said by telephone. âCaring about what happens to Xu Zhangrun is caring about ourselves.â
Professor Xuâs fate has followed the arc of many liberal Chinese intellectuals over the past decade. Once, they enjoyed a measure of official tolerance. But the Communist Party has made it increasingly difficult for many to teach, publish or go abroad.
In earlier years, Professor Xu was allowed to lecture at Chinese universities and publish essays and interviews in party-run newspapers and journals. But tightening restrictions have closed off such venues, and liberal academics like Professor Xu have become increasingly disheartened about the prospects for political relaxation and a measure of democratization under party rule.
âHe cares greatly about scholarship,â said Sarah Biddulph, a professor of law at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who has known Professor Xu since 1995, when he studied at the university. âHe is certainly not someone who would just grandstand or chase some form of notoriety.â
In other recent steps to dismantle intellectual dissent, party officials in 2016 engineered the takeover of a Chinese history magazine that had served as a forum for liberal former officials and scholars. Last year, the authorities in Beijing shut the Unirule Institute of Economics, a private think tank that favored economic and political liberalization.
Nevertheless, Professor Xu continued publishing critical essays â written in rapier-sharp classical Chinese style, rich in ridicule and historical references â mostly on the Chinese-language website of The Financial Times. From there, they spread among Chinese readers, although censorship stymied their widespread circulation.
âIn a season of discontent and buffeted by winds from all directions, silence now reigns in our realm,â Professor Xu wrote in an essay about his censors that Mr. BarmÃ© translated.
The university has moved against Professor Xu weeks before China enters a succession of potentially contentious dates, magnifying the nervousness of leaders who are already grappling with a slowing economy and a trade dispute with the United States.
May 4 will mark 100 years since patriotic student protesters took to the streets in Beijing, and June 4 is the 30th anniversary of the bloody repression of the Tiananmen Square protests. In October, the Communist Party will celebrate 70 years since Mao Zedong founded the Peopleâs Republic of China.
Professor Xu said the investigation by a team of officials from the university carried echoes of Maoâs destructive Cultural Revolution, when intellectuals and officials were investigated by âspecial case teams.â
âYesterday the investigation team told me that I was suspended from research. But thinking is in our blood,â he said. âUnless you liquidate me, how could you ever stop me doing my research?â

Chinese Dissidents Feel Heat of Beijingâs Wrath. Even in Canada.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245410719?accountid=14586,"MISSISSAUGA, Ontario â Search for Sheng Xue on Google in English and you will find the story of an award-winning writer who left China for Canada after the Tiananmen Square uprising and became one of the worldâs leading advocates for Chinese democracy.
But that same search in Chinese comes up with a very different portrait: Sheng Xue is a fraud, a thief, a traitor and a serial philanderer. Want proof? It offers up salacious photos, like one seeming to show her kissing a man who is not her husband.
As China extends its influence around the globe, it has mastered the art of soft power, establishing Confucius Institutes on Western college campuses and funding ports and power plants in developing countries.
But building up is only one prong of the Chinese strategy. The other is knocking down. And few know this better than Sheng Xue.
For more than six years, the Chinese-Canadian activist has been the victim of a relentless campaign to discredit her by blog, Listserv, e-book and social media, which experts say bears the markings of a coordinated attack by the Chinese Communist Party.
âThis is a textbook destabilization of the exile movement,â said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty Internationalâs regional director for East Asia.
âSince the early 1990s,â Mr. Bequelin said, âChina has understood the best way to neutralize this group and prevent them from essentially getting organized is to ensure they have no undisputed figurehead.â
Sheng Xue is the pen name for 57-year-old Zang Xihong. The attacks have left her name â and health â in tatters.
âI escaped Tiananmen Square in China,â she said one winter day sitting in the living room of her suburban bungalow outside Toronto. âI thought Iâd have a safe, happy life in Canada.â
But the Communist Party, she said, âwas already here.â
The smears cannot be definitively linked to the Chinese government, experts say.
However in Canada, security experts have warned for years about the growing influence of Beijing not only on Chinese expatriates but on the government itself. In 2010, the head of Canadaâs intelligence service shocked the country by declaring that the Chinese Communist Party had âagents of influenceâ in local governments.
And in 2017, a confidential report prepared by the Canadian branch of Amnesty International alerted the authorities to the harassment of Chinese-Canadian activists, the scale of which appeared âconsistent with a coordinated, Chinese state-sponsored campaign.â
The dissident who seemed to be getting the worst of it: Sheng Xue.
âI think sheâs a victim,â said Andy Ellis, the former assistant director of operations for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. âI strongly do. I think the Chinese government is trying to sully her reputation to advance their own interests.â
The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa declined to comment.
Rise to prominence. Flood of hate.
Sheng Xue, whose pen name is Mandarin for âabundant snow,â arrived in Canada in August 1989 on a visa to study journalism.
But while she had left China, she could not leave China behind.
Haunted by the sight of soldiers shooting into a crowd close to her familyâs apartment during the Tiananmen Square massacre in June of that year, Sheng Xue abandoned her study plans and threw herself into the burgeoning Chinese democracy movement in Toronto. She helped form a local branch of the Federation for a Democratic China, which at its height had 3,000 members in 25 countries.
Despite having forgone a degree, Sheng Xue broke into journalism and fashioned a successful career as a writer. But she was best known for her activism â leading protests, lobbying governments and helping fellow activists with their asylum cases.
In 2012, Canadaâs immigration minister gave her a medal for âextraordinary contributions to the country.â A month later, she was elected president of the federation.
The first conference she hosted as the groupâs president should have been a moment of glory. Hundreds came from across the globe.
The moment she remembers best, however, is stepping off the stage and finding herself surrounded by colleagues holding cellphones. They were showing her emails they had just received, with various photos of her half-naked.
Except they were obvious fakes.
In one photo, Sheng Xueâs face was pasted onto another womanâs body. Another email included a supposed love letter from her to an activist in Australia, so crass, it seemed a parody. The sender appeared to be yet another activist, Chin Jin, but he said the email was a fake.
It was a portent of the harassment to come.
There were sex-wanted ads posted in Sheng Xueâs name. Lurid stories about her sex life. Nude photos were published on a new Twitter account, of higher quality than the first ones, and harder to dismiss out of hand.
Some seemed to capture her kissing the Australian activist, Xiaogang Zhang, although both say they are fakes.
The timing seemed beyond coincidence.
âThere has been a pattern,â said Jie Chen, an associate professor of international relations at the University of Western Australia who studies the Chinese democracy movement. Pointing a finger at the Chinese Communist Party, he said, âWhoever is doing well, whoever seems to be effective in damaging the reputation of the C.C.P., all of a sudden they will get attacked very systematically.â
âI am the real Liu Shaofuâ
The attacks appear to exploit tensions within the dissident movement, where Sheng Xue is a polarizing figure.
âPeople who love her, really love her,â said Michael Stainton, the retired president of the Taiwanese Human Rights Association of Canada. âPeople who despise her, really despise her.â
Many of her attackers are former friends and colleagues. But in some cases they say their identities were stolen.
Zhu Rui, a Chinese-Canadian author, began questioning Sheng Xue back in 2010, after the two traveled together to Dharamsala, India.
Since then, Ms. Zhu has penned many critical blog posts and assembled two e-books about Sheng Xue, accusing her of lying, personally profiting off refugee applicants and events, and being a fake witness to the Tiananmen Square massacre, among other things.
But in 2011, Ms. Zhu said, someone hacked into her computer, stole an unpublished essay about Sheng Xue and sent it to a dissident group posing as her.
Similarly, Liu Shaofu, an elder of the democracy movement, said an impostor opened a Twitter account with his name and photo to post criticism of Sheng Xue, including one fake nude photo.
Mr. Liu had collaborated with Sheng Xue for years, even living in her basement, but they had a public falling out in 2013.
âI am the real Liu Shaofu,â he wrote in his first tweet after setting up a different account in June 2014. âDonât you feel ashamed you sent out so many tweets in my name?â
[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for the Canada Letter newsletter .]
Perhaps Sheng Xueâs most vocal critic is Fei Liangyong, a former federation president living in Germany who has accused her of a raft of moral failings, including âsexual impropriety and general wickedness.â
âTo not criticize her would run counter to my democratic ideas and bring shame on my lifelong struggle for democracy and constitutional government in China,â he said in an email.
Mr. Feiâs essays have been widely republished on anonymous anti-Sheng Xue blogs. But he said he did not know who was behind them. A Twitter account with his name and photo, which Mr. Fei said he did not create, posted links to one of the blogs.
Many fellow activists, even those who have themselves been targeted by the Chinese government, believe some of the accusations against Sheng Xue.
âThe Chinese government tries all means to marginalize, to silence and detain Chinese activists, in China and outside,â said Teng Biao, a civil rights lawyer who escaped China in 2012 and now lives in New Jersey.
But, he added, âwhat happened to Sheng Xue might be a little complicated, because as far as I know, some claims are true.â
Taken together, a pattern emerges: Doubt is turned into distrust, and dislike into loathing.
âItâs called blowing on the hot coals,â said Mr. Bequelin of Amnesty International.
A movement splintered
Sheng Xue learned the Chinese government had her on its black list in 1996, when she tried to return to Beijing. She was stopped at the airport, interrogated and sent back to Canada the next day.
Since then, it has become clear she remains a target, and at least three comrades in Canada report pressure from Chinese security services over their ties to her.
One, Yi Jun, said every time he returned to China, he was taken to tea by members of the Communist security bureau. âThey say Sheng Xue is very counterrevolutionary and a very bad person,â said Mr. Yi, the president of the federationâs Toronto branch.
Another dissident, Leon Liang, said his wife back in Shenzhen was visited regularly by the authorities and given a warning: âIf I didnât inform on Sheng Xue, they would take her job.â
The attacks on Sheng Xue have taken a toll not just on her but on the dissident movement itself. The federation, which had already dwindled to about 100 members, split in two in 2017, with Mr. Fei forming a second group. Sheng Xue has stepped down as president.
The fight was so public and ugly, it tarnished everyone.
One member in Germany distributed an âinvestigationâ a year after the death of Sheng Xueâs mother, claiming that she had pimped out her young daughters, and that it was the source of Sheng Xueâs moral bankruptcy.
âI really lament the fact the organization founded by Tiananmen Square leaders and intellectuals has degenerated to such a miserable state,â said Mr. Chen, the University of Western Australia professor.
Few dissidents will fail to get the message, said Michel Juneau-Katsuya, a former Canadian intelligence officer specializing in China: âIf you participate and support these people, look what I can do to you. Your local government wonât be able to protect you.â
Sheng Xue continues her activism, but her health has been declining. She has met with doctors about heart palpitations and headaches. She never found an effective defense against the campaign, which she dismisses in totality as lies.
Some of her supporters formed a âFriends of Sheng Xueâ organization, declaring the attacks a âthreat to Canadaâs sovereignty and security.â
They got nowhere.
In its report, Amnesty International urged the Canadian government to fashion a âcomprehensive approach to addressing this problem,â and suggested a complaint hotline.
That has not happened.
In 2016, a Chinese-Canadian human rights lawyer, Guo Guoting, volunteered himself as an arbiter between Sheng Xue and Mr. Fei. He considers both friends.
Mr. Guo moved into Sheng Xueâs home for a month and began researching the attacks. But his computer was hacked, he said, and âall the documents disappeared.â
He never published his report.
Research was contributed by Emile Dirks in Toronto and Karoline Kan in Beijing.

"With Pressure and Persuasion, China Deflects Criticism of Its Camps for Muslims","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245411597?accountid=14586,"In the opulent halls of the Emirates Palace hotel, a seat of power in Abu Dhabi where 114 domes decorate the vast rooftop, a delegation of about a dozen Chinese diplomats lobbied foreign ministers of the Muslim world last month.
China has been fighting criticism that it has detained as many as one million members of Muslim ethnic minorities in indoctrination camps in its western Xinjiang region. But at the two-day conclave in early March, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation â a group of 57 nations that has been a vocal defender of the Rohingyas and Palestinians â handed Beijing a significant victory.
In a resolution on protecting the rights of Muslim minorities around the world, the group praised China for âproviding care to its Muslim citizens.â
Its vast system of detention without trial has drawn condemnation from the State Department and Congress, but no sanctions, and only scattered criticism in Europe and at the United Nations. That is still more of a response than in the Muslim world, where nations â including Pakistan, Indonesia and other recipients of big Chinese loans â have overlooked Chinaâs abuses against ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others.
And as Muslim countries fall in line, the West is under less pressure to take action.
The major deterrent to antagonizing Beijing is its blunt economic power.
In Washington, President Trumpâs trade talks hang in the balance. China is building ports, railways and roads in countries rich and poor across Asia, Europe and Africa in its global trillion-dollar infrastructure push, the Belt and Road Initiative.
Some of the recipients are moderate Muslim countries, like Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia, which human rights advocates had hoped would counter conservative Arab statesâ lack of concern for Muslim minorities.
Even New Zealandâs Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, who forcefully condemned violence against Muslims after mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last month, focused on promoting trade with China during a visit to Beijing last week.
She raised the treatment of the Uighurs with Chinaâs top leaders only in private, and told reporters afterward, âYou canât do much more than that.â
Confident at Home and Abroad
When the West imposed sanctions on China for the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, policymakers gave little thought to retaliation. It was still a weak country then, without the economic leverage it now wields.
China is the European Unionâs biggest trading partner, and several newer members are grateful recipients of Chinaâs new infrastructure.
âNo one wants to do this alone,â said Mikko Huotari, deputy director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. âThereâs a general fear of deterioration of relations with China.â
In defending the detention camps to counterparts, Chinese diplomats have mounted some novel arguments. They have told American officials, for example, that Beijing is applying in Xinjiang best practices it gleaned from studying the United States.
The Chinese argue that the facilities in Xinjiang are no different from the American military prisons in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, where foreign terrorism suspects have been held without trial.
The Americans have replied that the detainees in GuantÃ¡namo eventually had access to lawyers, fair trial and visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross, none of which have been available in Xinjiang, two American officials involved in the conversations said.
The government insists that the camps are vocational training centers that curb extremism. But witnesses and experts describe them as the heart of an immense campaign to transform Xinjiangâs 11 million Uighurs and other minority Muslims into loyal servants of the Communist Party.
The campaign challenges traditional definitions of crimes against humanity, which complicates the worldâs response, said Adrian Zenz, a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany.
âWhat we are witnessing in Xinjiang is different, not quantitatively but qualitatively: a massive, concerted campaign of coerced sociocultural re-engineering,â he said. âIt is not so much a crime against physical bodies as it is against souls.â
There is also little dissent in China. The stateâs censored news outlets run propaganda videos that make the camps seem like quiet oases of work, with Uighur inmates sitting in rows at work tables.
Many Chinese support the governmentâs policies in Xinjiang because of concerns about Uighur separatism, including violent attacks.
âMost Chinese are very supportive of the iron fist policy,â said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations in Nanjing. âThe Chinese fear of deep Islamization and Islamic extremism is increasing.â
Beijing at first denied the campsâ existence. But it has since switched tactics, playing on fears of Islamic extremism.
Last month, Chinese officials even wrote letters to their counterparts urging them to avoid an event held by the United States mission in Geneva to discuss Xinjiang, suggesting that participation could hurt ties with Beijing.
How China Won the Support of Islamic Leaders
Before the Abu Dhabi gathering in March, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation held a December session on human rights.
There, member countries expressed concern about Chinaâs mass internment of Muslims, a campaign that they described as âdisturbingâ and said needed monitoring.
Around the world, rights activists cheered. It was a rare bright spot for Uighur advocates.
Fatimah Abdulghafur, 39, a Uighur doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that for the first time she had felt hopeful that her brother and father, whom she has been unable to contact for two years, would be released from the camps.
âMaybe hope is coming our way, maybe we can raise some global awareness among Muslims,â she recalled thinking after the December event.
But China responded with a diplomatic campaign targeting the Muslim world.
In January, China escorted eight officials from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on a 10-day tour of Xinjiang that included visits to select facilities, said a human rights advocate who was briefed on the visit.
There were differences among the officials about what they saw at the camps. Still, they decided to close ranks because they did not want to upset China at the foreign ministersâ gathering, the advocate said.
In the run-up to the Abu Dhabi meeting, China cemented its ties with two Arab friends â Saudi Arabia and Kuwait â who have a history of remaining silent on the plight of non-Arab Muslims.
It also made an example of a country that dared to criticize the camps.
In February, the spokesman for Turkeyâs foreign ministry, Hami Aksoy, called the âsystematic assimilationâ of the Uighurs a âgreat shame for humanityâ and urged China to close the camps.
Beijing ignored the request and retaliated by closing a Chinese consulate in Turkey. The Chinese ambassador, Deng Li, warned that âcriticizing your friend publicly everywhereâ could hurt economic relations.
Turkey is the current chair of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but when the countryâs delegate was given the floor in Abu Dhabi, he refrained from raising the issue of Xinjiang, the advocate who was briefed on discussions said.
The resolution passed by consensus. Uighurs like Ms. Abdulghafur were devastated.
âWe donât feel that global brotherhood love from them,â she said. âThey sell their soul, they sell their faith, for money. They know that millions of people are suffering.â

"China, a Major Bitcoin Source, Considers Moving Against It","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245406218?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â China is planning new steps that could put a stop to making Bitcoin there, a move that could cut off one of the worldâs largest sources of the popular but unstable cryptocurrency.
The National Development and Reform Commission, Chinaâs top economic planning body, this week added cryptocurrency mining to a list of about 450 industries that it proposes to eliminate. If the move is approved, local governments in China will be prohibited from supporting makers of Bitcoin and other digital currencies through subsidies or other benefits.
The commission said it would seek public comment until May 7 before making a final decision.
China was once the worldâs largest Bitcoin maker, though rising government pressure has forced many of those who make the cryptocurrency, known as miners, to other countries. Still, a number of Bitcoin miners could remain, especially if local governments ignored the instructions and found a way to prop up local producers, people in the business say.
âIt is categorized as an industry that is not encouraged or allowed to expand, but it is not a ban,â said Zhao Qianjie, a former executive at BTCChina, which was Chinaâs first cryptocurrency exchange.
Instead, he said, some producers may learn to live without subsidies and benefits like discounted electricity. âThe change will be the mining cost will rise,â said Mr. Zhao, who still owns a Bitcoin mine in Chinaâs northern region of Inner Mongolia.
Bitcoin miners use computers to crunch the mathematical formulas that create the basis for the currency. The business can be quite profitable, especially when Bitcoin prices are soaring, but the process requires amounts of electricity. Prices of the currency move up and down considerably and are currently above $5,000, according to Blockchain, a cryptocurrency firm.
China initially embraced Bitcoin and saw local miners as the potential basis for a new industry focused on digital currencies. China also has plenty of power, thanks to its extensively built-out electricity system and the closing of a growing number of heavy industry factories as the economy matures. At one point, China accounted for roughly two-thirds of all Bitcoin produced.
But China keeps a tight grip over how much money flows in and out of its borders, and cryptocurrencies â which are traded on decentralized computer networks and allow people to make transactions anonymously â threatened to undermine those capital controls.
Cryptocurrencies can also be used to circumvent laws to buy illegal goods, and Chinese officials were also spooked by the possibility that the wildly fluctuating prices could leave investors with big losses and lead to civil unrest.
The Chinese authorities began to ratchet up pressure on Bitcoin miners. In 2017, China ordered cryptocurrency exchanges to close. It has also banned initial coin offerings, a method by which start-ups or online projects can raise funds by issuing cryptocurrency. Many miners began to hide or flee to places with friendlier laws or abundant electricity, including the United States.
âAll the policies have created fear,â said Chandler Guo, who owned Bitcoin mines in China but moved to Silicon Valley in 2016. âMany have moved abroad.â
Still, China remains a significant force in the Bitcoin world. Based on different estimates, between 40 percent and 70 percent of the worldâs mining power is still in China.
The National Development and Reform Commissionâs proposal is the first time a central government body has announced a restrictive policy on Bitcoin mining, and it could make it difficult for miners to get loans to expand, said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a research organization in Beijing.
âLocal governments wonât act against it, so it will be more difficult for them to be approved or receive loans,â Mr. Wang said.
Miners said that while the crackdown on cryptocurrency had driven some miners abroad, the total cost of mining was still lower in China, where most of the mining machines are produced.
Yu Wei, a former executive with Bitmain, which makes products for mining cryptocurrencies, said the move could benefit the industry in the long run.
âThat means more miners will move abroad,â said Mr. Yu, who owns mines in Xinjiang and Yunnan Province in China, as well as in Central Asia. âThat will be good for decentralization of cryptocurrency.â

F.B. I. Bars Some China Scholars From Visiting U.S. Over Spying Fears,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245406291?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Just as he had on previous trips, Zhu Feng bolted down his lunch at a Los Angeles airport before sprinting to catch his Air China flight back to Beijing.
Suddenly, two F.B.I. agents blocked the Chinese scholar at the boarding gate and ordered him to hand over his passport. They flipped to the well-used 10-year visa to the United States and crossed out the page with a black pen.
ââGo back to China,ââ Mr. Zhu, a professor of international relations, recalled an agent telling him during that visit in January last year. âYou will receive a notification.â
In the four decades since China and the United States normalized relations, Washington has generally welcomed Chinese scholars and researchers to America, even when Beijing has been less open to reciprocal visits. Republican and Democratic administrations have operated on the assumption that the national interest was well served by exposing Chinese academics to American values.
Now, that door appears to be closing, with the two nations ramping up their strategic rivalry and each regarding academic visitors from the other with greater suspicion â of espionage, commercial theft and political meddling.
The F.B.I. has mounted a counterintelligence operation that aims to bar Chinese academics from the United States if they are suspected of having links to Chinese intelligence agencies. As many as 30 Chinese professors in the social sciences, heads of academic institutes, and experts who help explain government policies have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.
It follows the warning of the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, at a Senate hearing last year that China presented âa whole-of-society threat on their endâ that required a âwhole-of-society response.â
In a written response to questions, a State Department official said that American law enforcement believed Chinese intelligence services were increasingly using visiting Chinese scholars to target American citizens for intelligence gathering purposes. The department said it would not discuss the details of specific cases.
The F.B.I. said that it would not confirm or deny any investigations into the scholarsâ visits.
The Trump administration has sought to crack down on what it sees as intellectual property theft by Chinese scientists working at American research institutions. Last year, it began restricting visas for Chinese graduate students studying in sensitive research fields and warned biomedical researchers at American universities to beware of Chinese spies trying to steal information from their laboratories.
At the heart of the United Statesâ concerns is the view that China poses a threat to Americaâs technological dominance. President Xi Jinping has set a goal for China to become a global scientific power by 2049.
Some American scholars who have studied China for many years say that by barring some Chinese social science academics without reason, the United States risks damaging its reputation of being open and collaborative in the pursuit of knowledge.
Some of the Chinese scholars affected by the visa ban include intellectuals who have a well-rounded understanding of the United States, the Americans say.
âThese people are among the most sophisticated in how the U.S. works and are some of the strongest advocates of good relations with the United States,â said Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California San Diego. âWe are alienating some of Americaâs best friends in China.â
Other American researchers take a harder line, arguing that academic exchanges between the countries have become a one-way street benefiting China. They accuse China of denying visas to American scholars seeking to research subjects the Chinese consider too sensitive even as their Chinese compatriots face fewer restrictions in the United States.
China has for several decades denied visas to a number of influential American academics who have been critical of Chinaâs human rights record. And as President Xi wages a campaign against so-called Western values in academia, the authorities have only become even more selective.
Americaâs visa bans are particularly affecting experts at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a sprawling network of state-run institutes.
The director of the academyâs American studies institute, Wu Baiyi, said he was interviewed by F.B.I. agents in Atlanta where he attended an event at the Carter Center in January. His visa was later canceled.
Lu Xiang, a scholar at the same academy who spent six months at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington a few years ago, said his visa was canceled last year.
âThey may feel we know too much about the United States,â he said.
Some scholars have been told that they can apply for single-entry visas instead.
But they would have to provide their addresses, phone numbers and travel history over the last 15 years, said Wang Wen, the head of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies in Beijing, a think tank that promotes Chinaâs infrastructure program, the Belt and Road initiative.
Mr. Wangâs visa was canceled after he attended the conference at the Carter Center. He decided against applying for a single-entry visa because the questions were too intrusive, he said.
âI donât want to go to America in the coming years,â he said. âItâs not my loss, itâs the American governmentâs loss. They have lost an influential friend.â
Zhu Feng, 55, the international relations expert whose visa was canceled at a Los Angeles airport, was among the first generation of America experts in post-Mao China.
He had become enamored with American studies at Peking University in the 1980s and 1990s, studying with one of the giants of the field, Robert A. Scalapino. His first visit to the United States was to the Monterey Institute of International Studies in 1999.
The F.B.I. first questioned him when he landed in Los Angeles to make a connection to a conference in San Diego. They asked if he had worked with the Peopleâs Liberation Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They also asked him, he said, who among his colleagues had close relations with Chinese intelligence.
They told him, he said, that if he did not cooperate, he would be considered unfriendly toward the United States.
Mr. Zhu said he denied working with the military and that he told the agents he had nothing to say in response to the question about the foreign ministry. As for the question about his colleagues, he said: âI donât know.â He declined the offer to cooperate.
In an interview, Mr. Zhu said he worked with a group overseen by the China Association for International Friendly Contact, an arm of the ruling Communist Party that seeks to promote Chinese interests abroad. That group helped him organize a conference in China on Northeast Asian security that was attended by Dennis Blair, a retired admiral, and retired Chinese generals.
Mr. Zhu, who heads a South China Sea institute at Nanjing University, said he also cooperated with the foreign ministryâs policy planning department.
He said he has not acted in a way that would harm relations with the United States. He acknowledged that the unquestionable authority of the security apparatus puts Chinese academics in an awkward position.
âChina is, by its nature, a police state. When a national security official comes to my office, I have no way to kick them out,â he said.
The visa ban meant he could not travel to his sonâs college graduation. He saw his inability to visit as a symbol of how Chinese attitudes toward the United States will shift.
âIn the past four decades, my generation in China benefited a lot from good relations with the United States,â he said.
âBut for my sonâs generation, that will change. They think the U.S. is not helpful, is more unfriendly and is getting hateful.â

"In Australia, Muslims Call for Pressure on China Over Missing Relatives","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245393702?accountid=14586,"ADELAIDE, Australia â Growing up as a member of the Uighur ethnic group in Chinaâs far west, Farhad Habibullah never felt that his people were oppressed by the state. He came from a family of Communist Party loyalists, part of an elite segment of Uighur society celebrated by the party as model minority members.
But now he has joined other Uighurs in doing what was once, to him, unthinkable â and unthinkably dangerous, even in his new home in Australia: calling for an independent Uighur nation.
âMy parents worked for the Chinese Communist Party all their lives, and look at what has happened to them,â Mr. Habibullah said. They and several other relatives, he said, are among as many as one million Uighurs and other Muslims held in indoctrination camps in China.
âYou could say I grew up under the red Chinese flag,â he said. âBut now I think we have to fight for independence.â
About 3,000 Uighurs have found sanctuary in Australia. But as some of them draw attention to Chinaâs camps, they are putting their adopted homeland in an awkward position, pressing it to speak out against its largest trading partner.
More than a dozen Uighurs who are Australian permanent residents are missing in China and presumed to be in detention, activists say. Former detainees say Chinaâs camps are meant to root out devotion to Islam and replace it with loyalty to the state. Uighurs have lobbied Parliament to act, circulating petitions and holding regular protests, chanting: âChina, out! Out, out, out!â
Some Uighurs say that while they feel welcome here, they also fear that Islamophobia is on the rise. They say some people at rallies have said their people were terrorists who deserved to be in camps.
Some Uighurs also say they have been harassed by the Chinese authorities even while living in Australia. And they feel powerless over the fate of relatives back home, some of whom they have not heard from in years.
Mr. Habibullah finds support at gatherings like the one held in an Adelaide dinner hall on a recent Monday, attended by about 300 Uighurs, many in traditional dress. The flag of their hoped-for republic, East Turkestan, was on display, and the aroma of Uighur dishes like lamb pilaf and walnut cake filled the room.
As she held her 6-month-old baby, Zulihumaer Aibibula, 32, showed several pictures of relatives who were missing in Chinaâs far western region of Xinjiang, including her 35-year-old brother. For families abroad, who are not notified when a member disappears into one of Chinaâs secretive camps, prolonged silence is usually the only sign that it has happened.
Ms. Aibibula said the Chinese authorities had been pushing her family to ask her for her Australian passport number, address and other personal details. She refused to hand the information over, and shortly after, her brother disappeared.
âThe Chinese government is putting so much pressure on Uighurs,â she said, wiping her eyes. âThey are forcing people to go up against them.â
Xinjiang has long been troubled by tension between Uighurs, who are Sunni Muslims, and the government. Some Uighurs have carried out acts of violence against the government, which has imposed heavy restrictions in the region. The Chinese government depicts its detention camps as schools that steer Uighurs and other Muslims away from violent extremism by providing skills training.
Uighur activists say the government unfairly depicts Uighurs trying to escape its persecution as extremists.
In Australia, many Uighurs live in the Adelaide suburb of Gilles Plains, where one in 10 residents is Muslim. At the heart of the community is a mosque and a center where a Uighur group runs a language school and a soccer club.
[Sign up for the Australia Letter to get deeply reported stories from the region in your inbox each week.]
Their political cause is never far from their minds, says Anna Hayes, an expert on Xinjiang at James Cook University in Cairns, who spent time studying Uighurs here in 2011. That year, the community held a cultural exhibition that featured images of Uighur rallies and the blue flag of East Turkestan, as they call their homeland. Such displays would be banned in China.
In the past two years, many local Uighurs have been traumatized by the mass detentions back home and told her they were depressed, Dr. Hayes said. âI thought maybe it would be described like survivorâs guilt.â
The Uighurs want the Australian government to step up its criticism of Chinaâs camps. Australia was relatively muted about the issue until November, when it joined other Western nations in urging China to release the detainees.
But Canberraâs ties with Beijing are in a delicate state, as it tries to balance Australiaâs economic needs with national security concerns over expanding Chinese influence in the country.
Officials worked to retrieve three citizens of Uighur descent who were detained in Xinjiang in 2017, who have since returned. But Nurgul Sawut, an activist based in Canberra who helped compile the list of Australian permanent residents missing in China, said recent requests for help have been passed from one agency to another.
âWe have been let down,â said Ms. Sawut. âWeâre just falling through the cracks as they escape their responsibilities, but the families cannot afford to wait.â
Australiaâs slow response to the issue is due in part to its dependence on trade with China, said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinaâs ethnic policies at La Trobe University in Melbourne. âWe're incredibly vulnerable to China over the economic front,â he said.
Australiaâs foreign affairs department said in a statement that the country âcontinues to urge China to cease the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and other Muslim groups.â
The apparent detention of Mr. Habibullahâs parents underscores the expansive nature of the security crackdown in Xinjiang.
His mother was a city police superintendent, while his father had served in the Peopleâs Liberation Army and later held a senior post at a state-run broadcaster. Mr. Habibullah himself attended an elite high school in Beijing, which paved the way for him to leave China for a comfortable life abroad.
His parents were the last people who would ever criticize the Chinese government, he said.
Despite living abroad, Mr. Habibullah chatted with his parents regularly on the Chinese messaging service WeChat. Suddenly, in August, they stopped answering his messages.
He contacted police stations in Xinjiang and his parentsâ old workplaces, and he tried an official in the state security agency, all to no avail. With nine others in his family already missing, he feared the worst.
âI have lost everything,â he said repeatedly during an interview in February.
Late last month, however â days after The New York Times submitted requests to the Chinese authorities for comment on Mr. Habibullahâs family â he was told by a relative in Switzerland that his parents and sister-in-law had just been freed. The Xinjiang government said in a fax to The Times later that the three were living ânormal livesâ in Karamay, the city where they have resided.
For the first time in many months, Mr. Habibullah spoke to his parents by phone, he said, in a call he described as strange for how normal they sought to sound. Much was left unsaid â and unexplained.
âI really wanted to ask my mother where all our other relatives are,â Mr. Habibullah said, âbut I couldnât because our call was definitely being monitored.â
Ms. Sawut, the Uighur activist, said the news gave her hope.
âEnd of the day, weâd like to see or hear that our relatives or parents are safe,â she said. âAre they safe?â

China Cashes In on the Cannabis Boom,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244232379?accountid=14586,"SHANCHONG, China â China has made your iPhone, your Nikes and, chances are, the lights on your Christmas tree. Now, it wants to grow your cannabis.
Two of Chinaâs 34 regions are quietly leading a boom in cultivating cannabis to produce cannabidiol, or CBD, the nonintoxicating compound that has become a consumer health and beauty craze in the United States and beyond.
They are doing so even though cannabidiol has not been authorized for consumption in China, a country with some of the strictest drug-enforcement policies in the world.
âIt has huge potential,â said Tan Xin, the chairman of Hanma Investment Group, which in 2017 became the first company to receive permission to extract cannabidiol here in southern China. The chemical is marketed abroad â in oils, sprays and balms as treatment for insomnia, acne and even diseases like diabetes and multiple sclerosis. (The science, so far, is not conclusive.)
The movement to legalize the mind-altering kind of cannabis has virtually no chance of emerging in China. But the easing of the plantâs stigma in North America has generated global demand for medicinal products â especially for cannabidiol â that companies in China are rushing to fill.
Hanmaâs subsidiary in Shanchong, a village in a remote valley west of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, cultivates more than 1,600 acres of hemp, the variety of cannabis that is also used in rope, paper and fabrics. From the crop, it extracts cannabidiol in oil and crystal form at a gleaming factory it opened two years ago, in a restricted zone next to a weapons manufacturer.
âIt is very good for peopleâs health,â Tian Wei, general manager of the subsidiary, Hempsoul, said during an interview at the factory, which was punctuated by test gunfire from the manufacturer next door.
âChina may have become aware of this aspect a little bit late, but there will definitely be opportunities in the future,â Mr. Tian said.
China has, in fact, cultivated cannabis for thousands of years â for textiles, for hemp seeds and oil and even, according to some, for traditional medicine.
The Divine Farmerâs Classic of Materia Medica, a text from the first or second century, attributed curative powers to cannabis, its seeds and its leaves for a variety of ailments.
âProlonged consumption frees the spirit light and lightens the body,â it said, according to a translation cited in an article in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology.
The Peopleâs Republic of China, after its founding in 1949, took a hard line on illegal drugs, and cultivating and using marijuana are strictly forbidden to this day, with traffickers facing the death penalty in extreme cases.
After signing the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1985, China went even further. It banned all cultivation of hemp â which had long been grown in Yunnan, a mountainous province that borders Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam and is among Chinaâs poorest. Farmers produced hemp to make rope and textiles and China had banned it even though it has only trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the mind-altering compound found in marijuana.
At a news conference in Beijing last month, Liu Yuejin, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission, said the momentum toward legalization in other countries meant the Chinese authorities would âmore strictly strengthen the supervision of industrial cannabis.â
The Hempsoul factory has dozens of closed-circuit cameras that stream videos directly to the provincial public security bureau.
China relented on industrial hemp only in 2010, allowing Yunnan to resume production. Hemp then was used principally for textiles, including the uniforms of the Peopleâs Liberation Army, but soon the products expanded.
The growing industry has brought much-needed investment to Yunnan. The mild, springlike climate is exemplary for growing cannabis, and a farmer can earn the equivalent of $300 an acre for it, more than for flax or rapeseed, Mr. Tian of Hempsoul said.
Hempsoul is one of four companies in Yunnan that have received licenses to process hemp for cannabidiol, putting more than 36,000 acres under cultivation. Now others are joining the rush.
In February, the province granted a license to three subsidiaries of Conba Group, a pharmaceutical company based in Zhejiang Province. A company based in the city of Qingdao, Huaren Pharmaceutical, said recently it was applying for permission to grow hemp in greenhouses, which already line the landscape around Kunming.
Other regions have taken notice, too. In 2017, Heilongjiang, a province along Chinaâs northeastern border with Russia, joined Yunnan in allowing cannabis cultivation. Jilin, the province next door, said this year that it would also move to do so.
The flurry of announcements sent the companiesâ stocks soaring on Chinese exchanges, prompting regulators to step in to restrict trading.
While the health benefits of cannabidiol remain uncertain, the United States Food and Drug Administration last year approved the first use of it as a drug to treat two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. Other potential uses are being studied.
China permits the sale of hemp seeds and hemp oil and the use of CBD in cosmetics, but it has not yet approved cannabidiol for use in food and medicines. So, for now, the bulk of Hempsoulâs product â roughly two tons a year â is bound for markets overseas. Mr. Tian said he believed it was only a matter of time before China, too, approved the compound for ingestion.
Hanmaâs ambitions are global. It has acquired an extraction plant in Las Vegas, which is expected to begin production soon, and it plans one in Canada. Mr. Tan, the chairman, said he hoped that China, with the worldâs largest market, would follow the lead of the United States, which he called âthe best-educatedâ market for the benefits of cannabis.
âItâs a new application, but one that carries forward our tradition,â he said, citing the ancient texts describing its medicinal purposes.
Yang Ming, a scientist with the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Science who is one of Chinaâs leading experts on hemp, said the plantâs seeds were traditionally formed into a ball and used to treat constipation, but the psychotropic qualities of cannabis were not broadly known by farmers or other residents.
As China gradually opened up following the Cultural Revolution, however, foreign visitors to Yunnan in the late 1980s and early 1990s discovered an abundance of cannabis growing wild. That, in part, turned the region into a destination for backpackers and adventurers seeking a certain kind of experience.
âThey would go to the villagersâ cannabis fields, pick the buds and bring them back to the hotel to dry and smoke,â Dr. Yang said. âSome of them became deranged and ran around naked after smoking it.â
Thatâs when the authorities intervened. Dr. Yang, originally from Yunnan, was a recent graduate of the agricultural university in Beijing at the time. He was assigned to study cannabis, and he has been doing so ever since. His avatar on social media is a cannabis leaf.
The academy has been breeding its own varieties of hemp â each of which requires approval from the police â to ensure the plant contains less than 0.3 percent of THC, the international standard for cannabis. There are nine varieties now, and Dr. Yangâs team continues to research more.
One of the varieties, Yunnan Hemp No. 7, allows the extraction of greater amounts of cannabidiol. While the compoundâs use in commercial products remains in its infancy, Dr. Yang has watched the stigma of its association with marijuana begin to evaporate.
âOther countries,â he said, with pride of parenthood, âreally like our CBD.â

Xi Jinping Wanted Global Dominance. He Overshot.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244233311?accountid=14586,"The endgame in the trade war between China and the United States seems near. President Trump, betting with real currency â American strength â apparently has the upper hand, and the concessions President Xi Jinping is likely to make wonât be mere tokens. When â if? â an agreement is finally announced, Mr. Trump will surely fire off bragging tweets, partly to shore up his credentials for a second term, amid personal and policy troubles. For Mr. Xi, almost any deal could mean a very serious loss of face.
Mr. Xi assumed power when China was still riding high on its so-called economic miracle (and the United States remained mired in the aftereffects of the 2008-9 recession). He became general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) in late 2012 and president of the Peopleâs Republic in early 2013. His anticorruption campaign was instantly popular. He championed the âChinese Dream,â a vague vision of prosperity, strength and well-being for the country and its people, that seemed to fire up many citizens. His proposal to President Barack Obama to establish a âNew Model of Major Country Relationsâ could only please Han-majority Chinese with imperial yearnings.
But those were easy stunts, performed in a country with no audible opposition and that bans ârecklessâ talk about the government. The trade war, on the other hand, is the first real occasion to assess Mr. Xiâs leadership capabilities. And his performance might not look so good, even if one discounts the setbacks related to the trade war.
First and foremost, Mr. Xi has utterly failed to manage the United StatesâChinese relationship. In contrast, every Chinese leader since the founding of the communist state in 1949 had recognized the paramount importance of those ties, worked hard to improve them â and reaped huge benefits.
Mao staged Ping-Pong diplomacy to break the ice in 1971, and President Nixon supported him in his standoff against the Soviet Union. Deng Xiaoping went all-out to woo the United States, and President Jimmy Carter switched recognition of China from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. During the 1980s, the C.C.P. leaders Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang invited Milton Friedman and other American economists to visit and provide advice; after that, American capital and technology started flowing into China. In 1997, Jiang Zemin made an eight-day visit to the United States â at one point, while in Williamsburg, Va., putting on a three-cornered colonial hat. Bill Clinton then gave China a strong push to enter the World Trade Organization in 2001.
The Hu Jintao years, 2003â13, saw Chinaâs most tactful exploitation of American openness (and naÃ¯vetÃ©). Cheap Chinese imports created runaway bilateral trade deficits for the United States. The Confucius Institutes, a network of language schools cum influence agencies, began to take root in American universities and high schools. (Today, there are more than 100 throughout the United States.) Chinese venture capitalists flooded Silicon Valley with money raised in American financial markets â then quietly siphoned off cutting-edge American expertise and injected it into Chinaâs own high-tech hub.
But Mr. Xi has been aggressively hard-line. Under him, anti-American rhetoric has spread in official media. The Chinese government has been explicit about wanting to challenge the United Statesâs military presence in Asia. It has made aggressive moves toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It has sent Chinese battleships through American waters off the coast of Alaska. (It claimed to only be exercising the internationally recognized right of âinnocent passage,â but the move clearly was a show of force.)
State authorities in Beijing try to co-opt members of Chinaâs vast diaspora, hoping to develop a network that will facilitate political infiltration into other countries and high-tech transfers out of them. To this end, they resort to both overt schemes, like the Thousand Talents Plan, an official headhunting program, and covert tactics overseen by the C.C.P.âs influence machine, the United Front.
These efforts have set off alarms among some Americans. In 2017 and 2018, two groups of blue-ribbon scholars and ex-officials from previous United States administrations advocated a fundamental change in Americaâs view of China. Their members were moderates and mostly well-disposed toward China. Yet some of their recommendations dovetailed with the views of the Trump administration hawks who consider China to be Americaâs number-one enemy and security threat. Mr. Xi, apparently oblivious to this sea change, was caught unprepared when Mr. Trump hit China with a tariff war.
The dispute is having a knock-on effect elsewhere in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and Europe. After a summit in Brussels last month, China agreed to grant European Union countries âimprovedâ market access, stop the forced transfer of technology and discuss the possibility of curtailing state subsidies to Chinese companies, which, other governments say, gives them an unfair competitive advantage. Although these concessions were presented in the mild, mutual-promise language of a joint statement, they were a clear setback for China and will blunt its global ambitions.
Why is all of this happening under Mr. Xi? History suggests an answer.
In the late 1950s, Mao began to challenge the Soviet Unionâs leadership of the international communist movement, then a potent force that hoped to overturn the United States-led world order. Mao was also seeking global dominance, in line with the traditional concept that the emperor of the Middle Kingdom was the rightful ruler of âtian xiaâ (å¤©ä¸), everything under the heavens. But Mao overreached; China wasnât strong enough for that then. The Soviet Unionâs decision to scrap aid programs to China and pull out its scientific and technological advisers there dealt a severe blow to Chinaâs underperforming socialist economy.
Like Mao with the Soviets, Mr. Xi may have challenged the global leadership of the United States too hard and too soon.
Mr. Xiâs second major shortcoming has been his failure to articulate a coherent set of policies to stop the Chinese economyâs long-term weakening, after many years of stellar performance. Chinaâs gross-domestic-product growth in 2018 was the weakest in 28 years. The figure for the first quarter of this year was 6.4 percent, compared with the record high of 15.4 percent for the same period in 1993. Even that number would be the envy of many Western states, but the decline should concern Chinaâs leadership because it underlines the countryâs structural problems â notably, a rapidly graying population, a shrinking labor force and a total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio that neared 300 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The Japanese bank Nomura has estimated that defaults on bonds denominated in renminbi (also known as yuan) quadrupled between 2017 and 2018.
Weighed down by demographics and debt, China can hardly expand through more private investment and consumption. Worse, since its economy already has some huge excess capacities (think newly built ghost towns), government stimulus isnât very effective. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2008, it took one trillion yuan of credit to generate one trillion yuan of economic output; by 2017, the ratio was 3.5-to-1.
Yet Xi has done little to address these structural issues.
Evidence of severe demographic problems had become apparent by the late 2000s, but in 2016 Mr. Xi merely replaced the one-child policy with a two-child policy. Too little, too late. Chinaâs number of newborns per year has dropped since the changes. The 2018 total was the lowest since 1961, a year struck by a terrible famine. Mr. Xi signed off on an economic stimulus package in 2015 that was 25 percent larger than his predecessorâs emergency plan in 2009, which had been implemented as a response to the global financial crisis. And again, in January and February of this year alone, even while Mr. Xi has been paying lip service to the need to wean the economy off state support, the government offered new loans and financing exceeding the package for all of 2015, according to an article in Forbes.
A third criticism of Mr. Xi is that under him, China has sponsored or condoned actions by Chinese citizens and entities worldwide that have damaged the countryâs international reputation while degrading its own moral fabric.
Take intellectual property, for example. The United States seems to have hard evidence that it was the policy of Huawei, a flagship Chinese high-tech company, to reward employees for I.P. theft. And, as I have written before, such a policy is encouraged, arguably even mandatory, under Chinaâs 2017 National Intelligence Law.
Traditionally, the ideal Chinese state is a Confucian state that adheres to strict moral and behavioral norms. Yet for all his cracking down on corruption at home, Mr. Xi has encouraged moral turpitude abroad; his vision of China is a nation of patriotic thieves. All Chinese arguably have lost face as a result, and now innocent people overseas may be dismissed out of hand as guilty by association.
Mr. Xi is widely seen as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao. After the Constitution was amended last year, he could be president for life â unless his serious failures of leadership give his opponents at home enough reason to cut him short.

"In China, Some Fear the End of âChimericaâ","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244219779?accountid=14586,"Wu Shichun is one of countless Chinese entrepreneurs who over the past four decades have prospered from access to American customers and money.
Today, as the American government threatens to take that away, the serial entrepreneur and venture capital investor is fundamentally rethinking how he does business.
One of his portfolio companies designs and makes fashion products in China, then sells to American consumers on Amazon.com. Another, a vape device maker, sells most of its products in the United States. The third, which makes metal materials for electronic manufacturers, exports 40 percent of its production there. All three would be hit by new American tariffs.
âFrom now on Iâll have to invest in companies that focus on the Chinese market,â said Mr. Wu, 42.
âI hope China and the U.S. can find a better way to coexist,â he said. âIt doesnât have to be mutually destructive.â
The Chinese government has struck a defiant tone since President Trump ratcheted up the trade war on Friday by raising tariffs on Chinese exports worth $200 billion a year. âIf the U.S. wants to talk, our door is open,â said a commentary on state-controlled China Central Television on Monday night that quickly went viral. âIf the U.S. wants to fight, weâll be with them till the end.â
Many entrepreneurs and intellectuals, by contrast, are hoping for a deal. Chinaâs rise out of the stark terror of the Cultural Revolution was fueled in part from connections to the United States, an early diplomatic partner that offered investment, markets and opportunity. Thereâs even a word going around the Chinese internet for the tight economic bonds that have formed between the worldâs two largest economies: âChimerica.â
The trade war is taking direct aim at Chimerica. New tariffs, if they stick, threaten to cut off a big market for many Chinese companies.
[ Trumpâs love for tariffs began in Japanâs â80s boom .]
Beyond tariffs, trade hawks within the Trump administration are pursuing what they call decoupling, or breaking up a relationship that they now feel poses a long-term strategic threat to the United States. The trade hawks hope to get American companies to shift their factories to friendlier countries. They are pushing to restrict Chinese investment in the United States and cut academic and other bonds.
Now many people in China are wondering what will happen if the countries decouple. They question whether the country can continue its miraculous rise as borders and barriers go up.
âFrom the day we were born, my generation has always seen the countryâs economy heading for the better,â Feng Dahui, an early Alibaba employee and an internet entrepreneur in the city of Hangzhou, wrote on his timeline on WeChat, the Chinese social media service, on Monday evening.
âWeâve experienced the internet revolution and enjoyed the benefits of globalization,â he continued. âNow this type of optimism seems to be deserting us. Everything seems to be ending abruptly.â
Their concerns are unlikely to sway the Chinese government. Most political analysts believe that the only effective pressure will have to come from within the Chinese Communist Partyâs leadership, and official voices have been uniformly strident. Negative commentaries have been stricken from Chinaâs heavily censored internet.
Still, some entrepreneurs are expressing their worries.
Xiao Yu said the e-commerce business he founded, OFashion, which sells luxury goods from Europe and the United States to Chinese consumers, saw growth slow in the second half of last year partly because of the trade war. While only about 10 percent of its merchandise comes from American brands like Michael Kors or Coach, the trade war has hit Chinaâs stock market and hurt consumer confidence.
The trade war could jeopardize his dreams of raising money from American investors and perhaps even taking his start-up public on an American stock exchange, he said.
âAs an entrepreneur, our fate is tightly bound to the country,â Mr. Xiao said. He hopes and is confident that the two countries can reach a deal.
âChina and the U.S. donât have to have strained relations,â he said.
Many also appear worried that the trade war and the governmentâs tightening control over the private sector could halt or even reverse its progress. In a country only a couple of generations removed from starvation, the possibility doesnât seem far-fetched to many. One 2017 post online, called âA Guide to Eating Tree Bark,â described how people in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia survived during the starvation of the Great Leap Forward. It has recently gone viral again, with more than 100,000 page views.
The two sides have plenty of reasons to distrust each other. The United States blames China for heavy job losses, theft of corporate secrets and cheating at the rules of global trade. China credits the hard work and sacrifices of its people for its success and sees the trade war as driven by American fears of a prosperous Chinese nation.
But the doves in China say both sides benefit from the relationship more than they admit. Foreign investors were early backers and inspirations for Chinese internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent, for example. And many American companies and investors have profited handsomely from Chinaâs rise.
Those hoping for a deal worry that the Chinese government has fundamentally misjudged the Trump administration. At three top-level economic and monetary meetings in April, an economist at a Chinese investment bank said, government officials sent the signals that the leadership was optimistic about a trade deal.
Some people are resurrecting old articles online about the Chinese-American relationship that are now going viral. One of them was a January speech by Li Ruogu, a former chairman of the Export-Import Bank of China and former deputy governor of Chinaâs central bank. Mr. Li argued that many Chinese, including some senior officials, didnât realize that the relations had shifted fundamentally. The conflict wasnât about the United States being threatened by Chinaâs growth, he said, but by its vision of state-led capitalism.
âThis is the conflict of systems,â he wrote. âIt wonât end easily.â
Another popular, and subsequently censored, article had the headline âThe Reasons Behind the Chimerica Breakup,â recalling the portmanteau coined by Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick. The popularity of the article, whose author is anonymous, reflects a growing realization that the two countriesâ conflicts go beyond trade and may not have an easy solution.
The article argues that Chinaâs system of low human rights-based mercantilistic state capitalism negatively affected the pricing and wage structures in the United States and other developed economies. Now the United States wants China to change its economic growth model, the author argued, while China only wants to buy more American products to solve short-term trade imbalances.
âChimerica parted ways on May 10,â the author wrote. âNow itâs time to decide whether to adopt the U.S. rules or the Chinese rules.â

Bill Shorten Wants Australia to Embrace China. But at What Cost?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244219790?accountid=14586,"SYDNEY, Australia â In a recent online discussion, Bill Shorten, the front-runner in the race to be Australiaâs next prime minister, left little doubt about where he stood on the politically delicate issue of relations with China â and where the worldâs other superpower fit into his calculus.
âIf Iâm P.M., I welcome the rise of China in the world,â he said in a post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat that was aimed at Australiaâs 1.2 million voters of Chinese descent. Mr. Shorten, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, added that he saw China not as a âstrategic threat,â but as a âstrategic opportunity.â
Those words put him directly at odds with the Trump administration, which has sounded alarms about Chinaâs global ambitions and tactics. But Mr. Shorten, while acknowledging that Australia would always be an ally of the United States, declared that it was time for his nation âto stand on its own feet and think for itself.â
If Mr. Shortenâs party prevails in Saturdayâs election, his embrace of China would represent a significant break from the current conservative Australian government, which has taken a harder line toward Beijingâs growing influence in the country and whose leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, is an avowed admirer of President Trump. It could also signify a crack in the united front that the Trump administration is trying to build to check Chinaâs ascent.
For Mr. Shorten, the calculation may be largely about economics. The Labor leader, whose campaign has promised significant spending to bolster public health programs, education and wages, is hoping that improved relations with China, Australiaâs biggest trading partner, will keep the economy growing.
Mr. Morrison, whose conservative coalition has narrowed the gap with Mr. Shortenâs Labor Party in polls but is still trailing, has focused his election message on the notion that Laborâs spending plans would send the economy into a recession. That is a frightening prospect to Australians who have known only economic expansion for a generation.
But critics fear that any softening toward China could have much broader ramifications, putting pressure on Australia, for instance, to roll back its clampdown on foreign interference or to keep silent on Chinese human rights abuses.
Mr. Morrisonâs warier stance on China was crystallized by remarks he made on Monday when asked about the protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing. He said that he would not pick sides, saying, âYou stand by your friends, and you stand by your customers as well.â
The prime ministerâs branding of China as a âcustomerâ drew derision from Mr. Shorten, who promised âa bit more sophisticationâ in handling ties between the countries. For decades, Australiaâs economy has been buoyed by the export of natural resources to China, as well as money from Chinese students, tourists and investors.
Itâs clear which leader Chinese officials prefer: Social media accounts on WeChat affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party have mocked Mr. Morrison and his government. One account disparaged âa country whose head has been kicked hard by kangaroosâ and now wanted to be friends again after a rough patch.
Regardless of who wins the election, Australia will continue to face profound questions over how it balances the economic necessity of cooperating with China with the imperative of protecting its national security interests. Australia is also grappling with its place in the Asia-Pacific region, and the world beyond, as China seeks to expand its economic and military power.
The relationship between the two countries has grown strained in recent years as the Australian government, heeding warnings from national security leaders, has pushed back against Beijingâs attempts to expand its reach within the countryâs corporations, universities and national institutions, including Parliament.
The Australian government passed legislation cracking down on foreign interference and secret lobbying on behalf of foreign interests. It also banned the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from seeking a contract to install fifth-generation cellular networks in Australia, citing potential threats to national security.
Beijing, in turn, has held up Australian coal and wine imports, and is believed to be behind a cyberattack that infiltrated the networks of the federal Parliament and the three main political parties. (China has dismissed the hacking allegations as a smear campaign.)
China has also bypassed the federal government by signing deals with individual Australian states as part of its gargantuan Belt and Road infrastructure initiative â a global push that the United States and other critics say has lacked transparency and trapped partners in debt.
While it is seen as unlikely that Mr. Shorten, who declined requests for an interview, would reverse the governmentâs ban on Huawei, his party has indicated that it is open to signing on to the Belt and Road program.
âThe fact that Australia is this ally that sits geographically parked in the Asia-Pacific does put it very much in the cross hairs of Chinaâs worldview, particularly on the idea of splintering and weakening the U.S. alliance system,â said Euan Graham, the executive director of La Trobe Asia, a department of La Trobe University in Melbourne.
The Labor Party has traditionally promoted itself as more independent of American foreign policy compared with the conservative coalition, which under Prime Minister John Howard sent Australian troops into Afghanistan and Iraq.
In 2016, Mr. Shorten said that Mr. Trumpâs views on some issues were âbarking mad.â When asked by a television audience this year how he would reconcile those comments should he meet with Mr. Trump as prime minister, Mr. Shorten said he would deal with Mr. Trump âprofessionally and politely.â
âBut you ask, China or America? In Australia, weâre smart enough to work with all of them to Australiaâs long-term interest if we behave in a smart and respectful fashion,â Mr. Shorten told the audience.
Two recent cases involving public figures with ties to Australia may offer a glimpse of how Mr. Shorten would carry out that ârespectfulâ approach.
Mr. Shorten has been reluctant to publicly criticize China over its detention of a Chinese-Australian novelist, Yang Hengjun, saying the case should not be handled through âmegaphone diplomacy.â But in the case of Bahraini soccer player Hakeem al-Araibi, who had been granted asylum in Australia, Mr. Shortenâs party directly contacted the authorities in Thailand, where Mr. al-Araibi was being held, to urge his release.
If China senses a friendlier stance from a Labor government, human rights is likely to be one of the areas where it would try to push first, said Giovanni Di Lieto, an international trade law expert at Monash University in Melbourne.
âThat will be the real litmus test,â he said.
Mr. Shorten is hoping to shift the debate on the proper approach toward China, which has largely been driven by a sharp divide between the countryâs business community and its national security establishment.
Connections to China run deep in the Labor Party, and have been a sore point at times. One of Mr. Shortenâs mentors, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, was until recently the chairman of the advisory board for the China Development Bank, which has poured nearly $200 billion into Belt and Road projects.
And Bob Carr, a former Labor foreign minister, has essentially become one of the Chinese governmentâs most effective spokesmen, and now heads a university institute dedicated to Chinese-Australian relations.
While the governing coalition has had its share of China-connected scandals as well, the shadows have been especially hard for Labor to cast off.
During one election campaign debate, a coalition government minister began reeling off the names of past Labor politicians who had taken on Chinese-funded roles after leaving politics.
The Labor senator who participated in the debate, Penny Wong, is a popular and well-respected figure with a nuanced and sometimes critical view of China. But she was so infuriated by her opponentâs comments that she refused to shake his hand at the end of their debate.

How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244175936?accountid=14586,"KASHGAR, China â A Godâs-eye view of Kashgar, an ancient city in western China, flashed onto a wall-size screen, with colorful icons marking police stations, checkpoints and the locations of recent security incidents. At the click of a mouse, a technician explained, the police can pull up live video from any surveillance camera or take a closer look at anyone passing through one of the thousands of checkpoints in the city.
To demonstrate, she showed how the system could retrieve the photo, home address and official identification number of a woman who had been stopped at a checkpoint on a major highway. The system sifted through billions of records, then displayed details of her education, family ties, links to an earlier case and recent visits to a hotel and an internet cafe.
The simulation, presented at an industry fair in China, offered a rare look at a system that now peers into nearly every corner of Xinjiang, the troubled region where Kashgar is located.
This is the vision of high-tech surveillance â precise, all-seeing, infallible â that Chinaâs leaders are investing billions of dollars in every year, making Xinjiang an incubator for increasingly intrusive policing systems that could spread across the country and beyond.
It is also a vision that some of President Trumpâs aides have begun citing in a push for tougher action against Chinese companies in the intensifying trade war. Beyond concerns about market barriers, theft and national security, they argue that China is using technology to strengthen authoritarianism at home and abroad â and that the United States must stop it.
Developed and sold by the China Electronics Technology Corporation, a state-run defense manufacturer, the system in Kashgar is on the cutting edge of what has become a flourishing new market for technology that the government can use to monitor and subdue millions of Uighurs and members of other Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.
Treating a city like a battlefield, the platform was designed to âapply the ideas of military cyber systems to civilian public security,â Wang Pengda, a C.E.T.C. engineer, said in an official blog post. âLooking back, it truly was an idea ahead of its time.â
The system taps into networks of neighborhood informants; tracks individuals and analyzes their behavior; tries to anticipate potential crime, protest or violence; and then recommends which security forces to deploy, the company said.
On the screen during the demonstration was a slogan: âIf someone exists, there will be traces, and if there are connections, there will be information.â
A New York Times investigation drawing on government and company records as well as interviews with industry insiders found that China is in effect hard-wiring Xinjiang for segregated surveillance, using an army of security personnel to compel ethnic minorities to submit to monitoring and data collection while generally ignoring the majority Han Chinese, who make up 36 percent of Xinjiangâs population.
It is a virtual cage that complements the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang where the authorities have detained a million or more Uighurs and other Muslims in a push to transform them into secular citizens who will never challenge the ruling Communist Party. The program helps identify people to be sent to the camps or investigated, and keeps tabs on them when they are released.
The Trump administration is considering whether to blacklist one of the Chinese companies at the center of the Xinjiang effort, Hikvision, and bar it from buying American technology. Hikvision is a major manufacturer of video surveillance equipment, with customers around the world and across Xinjiang, where its cameras have been installed at mosques and detention camps. C.E.T.C. owns about 42 percent of the company through subsidiaries.
âXinjiang is maybe a kind of more extreme, more intrusive example of Chinaâs mass surveillance systems,â said Maya Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch who has studied the technology in the region. âThese systems are designed for a very explicit purpose â to target Muslims.â

In the city of Kashgar, with a population of 720,000 â about 85 percent of them Uighur â the C.E.T.C. platform draws on databases with 68 billion records, including those on peopleâs movements and activities, according to the demonstration viewed by a Times reporter at the industry fair, held in the eastern city of Wuzhen in late 2017.
By comparison, the F.B.I.âs national instant criminal background check system contained about 19 million records at the end of 2018.
The police in Xinjiang use a mobile app, made by C.E.T.C. for smartphones running the Android operating system, to enter information into the databases.
Human Rights Watch, which obtained and analyzed the app, said it helped the authorities spot behavior that they consider suspicious, including extended travel abroad or the use of an âunusualâ amount of electricity.
The app, which the Times examined, also allows police officers to flag people they believe have stopped using a smartphone, have begun avoiding the use of the front door in coming and going from home, or have refueled someone elseâs car.
The police use the app at checkpoints that serve as virtual âfencesâ across Xinjiang. If someone is tagged as a potential threat, the system can be set to trigger an alarm every time he or she tries to leave the neighborhood or enters a public place, Human Rights Watch said.
âThe governmentâs arbitrary power is reflected, or coded, in the app,â Ms. Wang said, adding that the system âis programmed to consider vague, broad categories of behaviors, many of them perfectly legal, as indicators of suspiciousness.â
Intelligence agencies in many countries use sets of behavior to single out individuals for greater scrutiny. But China has taken that approach to an extreme, treating the Muslim population in Xinjiang as suspect from the start and defining suspicious behavior in sweeping terms, including peaceful religious activities such as making a donation to a mosque.
The Chinese government has defended the surveillance program, saying it has improved security in the region, and says the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang are job training centers. Hikvision has denied âany inappropriate actions in Xinjiang,â and C.E.T.C. declined to comment when reached by phone.
C.E.T.C. traces its roots to the military research labs that helped build Chinaâs first nuclear bomb, satellite and guided missile. Established as a state defense manufacturer in 2002, it soon expanded into civilian security matters, working with Microsoft, for instance, to create a version of Windows that meets the governmentâs internal security requirements.
In recent years, it turned to Xinjiang.
The Communist Party, which took control of the region in 1949, has long been wary of the Uighurs, whose Turkic culture and Muslim faith have inspired demands for self-rule, and sometimes attacks on Chinese targets. State investment in surveillance took off a decade ago after anti-Chinese rioting in the regional capital, Urumqi, killed nearly 200 people.
The real bonanza of security contracts came after Xi Jinping took the helm of the party in late 2012. Spending on internal security in Xinjiang totaled nearly $8.4 billion in 2017, six times as much as in 2012, including funds for surveillance, personnel and the indoctrination camps.
Hikvision has received contracts in Xinjiang worth at least $290 million for its cameras and facial recognition systems. Another company tapping into Xinjiangâs security gold rush is Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that the United States has described as a security threat. It signed an agreement last year with the regionâs police department to help officers analyze data.
âThe goal here is instilling fearâ
The multilayered program to harvest information from Uighurs and other Muslims begins on the edges of towns and cities across Xinjiang in buildings that look like toll plazas.
Instead of coins, they collect personal information.
On a recent visit to one checkpoint in Kashgar, a line of passengers and drivers, nearly all Uighur, got out of their vehicles, trudged through automated gates made by C.E.T.C. and swiped their identity cards.
âHead up,â the machines chimed as they photographed the motorists and armed guards looked on.
There are smaller checkpoints at banks, parks, schools, gas stations and mosques, all recording information from identity cards in the mass surveillance database.
Identification cards are also needed to buy knives, gasoline, phones, computers and even sugar. The purchases are entered into a police database used to flag suspicious behavior or individuals, according to a 2017 dissertation by a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences that features screenshots of the system in Kashgar.
Not everyone has to endure the inconvenience. At many checkpoints, privileged groups â Han Chinese, Uighur officials with passes, and foreign visitors â are waved through âgreen channels.â In this way, the authorities have created separate yet overlapping worlds on the same streets â and in the online police databases â one for Muslim minorities, the other for Han Chinese.
âThe goal here is instilling fear â fear that their surveillance technology can see into every corner of your life,â said Wang Lixiong, a Chinese author who has written about Xinjiang as well as Chinaâs surveillance state. âThe amount of people and equipment used for security is part of the deterrent effect.â
A database stored online by SenseNets, a Chinese surveillance company, and examined by the Times suggests the scale of surveillance in Xinjiang: It contained facial recognition records and ID scans for about 2.5 million people, mostly in Urumqi, a city with a population of about 3.5 million.
âThis can be pulled off by anyone, and thatâs the part that worries me,â said Victor Gevers, a Dutch security researcher and co-founder of GDI Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes internet security.
According to Mr. Gevers, who discovered the unsecured database, the online records indicate that a network of about 10,000 checkpoints in Urumqi made more than six million identifications in 24 hours.
The authorities in Xinjiang also sometimes force residents to install an app known as âClean Net Guardâ on their phones to monitor for content that the government deems suspicious.
Kashgar and other areas of Xinjiang have in recent years systematically collected DNA and other biological data from residents too, especially Muslims. Officials now collect blood, fingerprints, voice recordings, head portraits from multiple angles, and scans of irises, which can provide a unique identifier like fingerprints.
These databases are not yet completely integrated, and despite the futuristic gloss of the Xinjiang surveillance state, the authorities rely on hundreds of thousands of police officers, officials and neighborhood monitors to gather and enter data.
âWe risk understating the extent to which this high-tech police state continues to require a lot of manpower,â said Adrian Zenz, an independent researcher who has studied security spending in Xinjiang. âIt is the combination of manpower and technology that makes the 21st-century police state so powerful.â
Expanding beyond the region
Xinjiangâs security and surveillance systems are already attracting admirers from the rest of China. Delegations of police officers from other provinces and cities have visited Kashgar and other cities to admire â and consider adopting â the measures.
They often visit police command centers where rows of officers peer at computers, scanning surveillance video feeds and information on residents on the C.E.T.C. platform.
âThe digitalization of police work has achieved leap-like growth in Xinjiang,â Zhang Ping, a counterterrorism officer from Jiujiang, a city in southeastern China, said during a visit to Xinjiang last year, according to an official report on the website of the cityâs police bureau.
Xinjiangâs high-tech policing, he added, was âsomething we should vigorously study.â
Zhejiang and Guangdong, two wealthy provinces on Chinaâs southeastern coast, have been testing the C.E.T.C. surveillance system used in Xinjiang, âlaying a robust foundation for a nationwide rollout,â the company said last year.
C.E.T.C. has also signed an agreement with the police in the southern city of Shenzhen to provide an advanced âcommand center information systemâ similar to the one in Xinjiang.
The technology has some way to go. Dust and bad lighting can hobble facial recognition on security cameras, which struggle to track large numbers of people simultaneously. Even the best systems can be accurate in less than 20 percent of cases, according to one study published by a journal linked to the Ministry of Public Security.
A technician who until recently installed and maintained computers for the authorities in Xinjiang said police surveillance centers relied on hundreds of workers to monitor cameras, an expensive and inefficient undertaking.
And outside urban centers, police officers often do not have the skills to operate the sophisticated systems, said the technician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing repercussions for speaking to a journalist.
The spending spree on security in Xinjiang has left local governments across the region with staggering bills, raising questions about how the authorities can keep the systems running.
In Kashgar, for example, the county of Yengisar warned this year of a âhuge shortfallâ from spending on security and said that it had accumulated 1 billion renminbi, or about $150 million, in previously undeclared âinvisible debt.â
âThe pressure from ensuring basic spending for additional staff and to maintain stability is extraordinary,â it said.
Still, the regionâs leaders told officials this year that they must not wind back spending.
âPreserving stability is a hard-and-fast task that takes priority over everything else,â the leadership said in the regionâs annual budget report. âUse every possible means to find funds so that the high-pressure offensive does not let up.â

"30 Years After Tiananmen, a Chinese Military Insider Warns: Never Forget","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244179029?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â For three decades, Jiang Lin kept quiet about the carnage she had seen on the night when the Chinese Army rolled through Beijing to crush student protests in Tiananmen Square. But the memories tormented her â of soldiers firing into crowds in the dark, bodies slumped in pools of blood and the thud of clubs when troops bludgeoned her to the ground near the square.
Ms. Jiang was a lieutenant in the Peopleâs Liberation Army back then, with a firsthand view of both the massacre and a failed attempt by senior commanders to dissuade Chinaâs leaders from using military force to crush the pro-democracy protests. Afterward, as the authorities sent protesters to prison and wiped out memories of the killing, she said nothing, but her conscience ate at her.
Now, in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown, Ms. Jiang, 66, has decided for the first time to tell her story. She said she felt compelled to call for a public reckoning because generations of Chinese Communist Party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have expressed no remorse for the violence. Ms. Jiang left China this week.
[ New documents show power games behind Tiananmen crackdown. ]
âThe pain has eaten at me for 30 years,â she said in an interview in Beijing. âEveryone who took part must speak up about what they know happened. Thatâs our duty to the dead, the survivors and the children of the future.â
Ms. Jiangâs account has a wider significance: She sheds new light on how military commanders tried to resist orders to use armed force to clear protesters from the square they had taken over for seven weeks, captivating the world.
The studentsâ impassioned idealism, hunger strikes, rebukes of officials and grandiose gestures like building a âGoddess of Democracyâ on the square drew an outpouring of public sympathy and left leaders divided on how to respond.
She described her role in spreading word of a letter from senior generals opposing martial law, and gave details of other letters from commanders who warned the leadership not to use troops in Beijing. And she saw on the streets how soldiers who carried out the partyâs orders shot indiscriminately as they rushed to retake Tiananmen Square.
Even after 30 years, the massacre remains one of the most delicate topics in Chinese politics, subjected to a sustained and largely successful effort by the authorities to erase it from history. The party has ignored repeated calls to acknowledge that it was wrong to open fire on the students and residents, and resisted demands for a full accounting of how many died.
The authorities regularly detain former protest leaders and the parents of students and residents killed in the crackdown. A court convicted four men in southwestern China this year for selling bottles of liquor that referred to the Tiananmen crackdown.
Over the years, a small group of Chinese historians, writers, photographers and artists have tried to chronicle the chapters in Chinese history that the party wants forgotten.
But Ms. Jiangâs decision to challenge the silence carries an extra political charge because she is not only an army veteran but also the daughter of the military elite. Her father was a general, and she was born and raised in military compounds. She proudly enlisted in the Peopleâs Liberation Army about 50 years ago, and in photos from her time as a military journalist, she stands beaming in her green army uniform, a notebook in hand and camera hanging from her neck.
She never imagined that the army would turn its guns against unarmed people in Beijing, Ms. Jiang said.
âHow could fate suddenly turn so that you could use tanks and machine guns against ordinary people?â she said. âTo me, it was madness.â
Qian Gang, her former supervisor at the Liberation Army Daily, who now lives abroad, corroborated details of Ms. Jiangâs account. Ms. Jiang shared hundreds of yellowing pages of a memoir and diaries that she wrote while trying to make sense of the slaughter.
âMore than once Iâve daydreamed of visiting Tiananmen wearing mourning clothes and leaving a bunch of pure white lilies,â she wrote in 1990.
âThe Peopleâs Militaryâ
Ms. Jiang felt a stab of fear in May 1989 when radio and television news crackled with an announcement that Chinaâs government would impose martial law on much of Beijing in an effort to clear student protesters from Tiananmen Square.
The protests had broken out in April, when students marched to mourn the sudden death of Hu Yaobang, a popular reformist leader, and demand cleaner, more open government.
By declaring martial law across urban Beijing, Deng Xiaoping, the partyâs leader, signaled that armed force was an option.
Researchers have previously shown that several senior commanders resisted using military force against the protesters, but Ms. Jiang gave new details on the extent of the resistance inside the military and how officers tried to push back against the orders.
Gen. Xu Qinxian, the leader of the formidable 38th Group Army, refused to lead his troops into Beijing without clear written orders, and checked himself into a hospital. Seven commanders signed a letter opposing martial law that they submitted to the Central Military Commission that oversaw the military.
âIt was a very simple message,â she said, describing the letter. âThe Peopleâs Liberation Army is the peopleâs military and it should not enter the city or fire on civilians.â
Ms. Jiang, eager to spread the word of the generalsâ letter, read it over the telephone to an editor at Peopleâs Daily, the Communist Partyâs main newspaper, where the staff were disobeying orders to censor news about the protests. But the paper did not print the letter because one of the generals who signed it objected, saying it was not meant to be made public, she said.
Ms. Jiang still hoped that the rumblings inside the military would deter Deng from sending in soldiers to clear the protesters. But on June 3, she heard that the troops were advancing from the west of the city and shooting at people.
The army had orders to clear the square by early on June 4, using any means. Announcements went out warning residents to stay inside.
âAny Lie Is Possibleâ
But Ms. Jiang did not stay inside.
She remembered the people she had seen on the square earlier in the day. âWould they be killed?â she thought.
She headed into the city on bicycle to watch the troops come in, knowing that the confrontation represented a watershed in Chinese history. She knew she risked being mistaken for a protester because she was dressed in civilian clothes. But that night, she said, she did not want to be identified with the military.
âThis was my responsibility,â she said. âMy job was to report major breaking news.â
Ms. Jiang followed soldiers and tanks as they advanced into the heart of Beijing, bursting through makeshift blockades formed with buses and firing wildly at crowds of residents furious that their government was using armed force.
Ms. Jiang stayed close to the ground, her heart pounding as bullets flew overhead. Bursts of gunfire and blasts from exploding gasoline tanks shook the air, and heat from burning buses stung her face.
Near midnight, Ms. Jiang approached Tiananmen Square, where soldiers stood silhouetted against the glow of fires. An elderly gatekeeper begged her not to go on, but Ms. Jiang said she wanted to see what would happen. Suddenly, over a dozen armed police officers bore down on her, and some beat her with electric prods. Blood gushed from her head, and Ms. Jiang fell.
Still, she did not pull out the card that identified her as a military journalist.
âIâm not a member of the Liberation Army today,â she thought to herself. âIâm one of the ordinary civilians.â
A young man propped her on his bicycle to carry her away, and some foreign journalists rushed her to a nearby hospital, Ms. Jiang said. A doctor stitched up her head wound. She watched, dazed, as the dead and wounded arrived by dozens.
The brutality of that night left her shellshocked.
âIt felt like watching my own mother being raped,â she said. âIt was unbearable.â
Ms. Jiang has long hesitated to tell her story. The head injury she suffered in 1989 left her with a scar and recurring headaches.
She was interrogated in the months after the 1989 crackdown, and detained and investigated twice in following years over the private memoir that she wrote. She formally left the military in 1996 and has since lived a quiet life, largely ignored by the authorities.
In recalling the events over several interviews in recent weeks, Ms. Jiangâs voice often slowed and her sunny personality seemed to retreat under the shadow of her memories.
Over the years, she said, she waited for a Chinese leader to come forward to tell the country that the armed crackdown was a calamitous error.
But that day never came.
Ms. Jiang said she believed that Chinaâs stability and prosperity would be fragile as long as the party did not atone for the bloodshed.
âAll this is built on sand. Thereâs no solid foundation,â she said. âIf you can deny that people were killed, any lie is possible.â

Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244179211?accountid=14586,"When President Trump tweeted on May 5 that the China trade deal was off, the historical echoes in Beijing were loud and clear. Almost exactly 100 years earlier, Chinaâs âMay Fourth Movementâ of 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War I. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be returned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-American, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.
Thus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time when he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is now full of accounts of the countryâs economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking the spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare down the vastly superior American military.
And just in case people didnât get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of the Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately emerged victorious.
I can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need to take into consideration events in Chinaâs ancient past?
The answer depends on what Mr. Trumpâs primary objective is. If itâs to sound tough to American voters, he may well have a winning formula. But if itâs to bring about a substantive change in Chinaâs negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes in Chinaâs trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, Iâm not so sure.
Days after the presidentâs tweets, China listed three âred lines,â positions the United States had taken in the trade talks that were unacceptable: First, that it would keep tariffs in place for a period after the proposed trade agreement was signed. Second, that it could impose punitive tariffs if it judged China to be in violation of the agreement, and that China would be forbidden from retaliating with its own tariffs. Third, the ever-inflating expectations of the terms under which Beijing would buy American goods under a proposed bilateral purchasing agreement.
These âred linesâ were new. Before that, Chinaâs negotiating team had a fully flexible remit from the leadership. But not anymore. Now that these three lines are in the public domain, there is no way Chinese leaders can yield on them. The leaks of large parts of the negotiating text to the American news media has added a new level of toxicity, making it virtually impossible to return to the existing text as a basis of negotiations. Together with recent moves against the Chinese telecom company Huawei presumably intended to pressure Beijing further, the possibility of negotiating a revised agreement that is more accommodating to American interests is now very slim.
Instead, what I have seen in Beijing over the last few weeks is a country moving in exactly the opposite direction.
Economic analysts, meanwhile, have been calculating the impact of a full-blown trade war, estimating a loss of about 1.2 percentage points to Chinese G.D.P. growth. This figure is now portrayed in the Chinese media as entirely manageable given Chinaâs capacity to use fiscal and monetary policy stimulus to support domestic demand and keep growth above 6 percent.
Even if a trade deal with the United States is still possible, some in the Chinese leadership are now starting to ask, why bother? They argue that in technology, investment, foreign policy, national security and human rights, the Trump administration has made it clear that it has embarked on a more adversarial position toward China. So why should Beijing expend any more political capital on a trade deal? Perhaps itâs better, in Chinaâs view, to cut its losses now and get ready for the next Cold War.
If thatâs what the Trump administration wants, its strategy has been a great success. If not, and the president really wants a trade deal, with reasonable decreases in the bilateral trade deficit, and some substantive changes in Chinese economic behavior, the American negotiating strategy requires some serious recalibration.
Of course, Chinaâs public position is that negotiations can continue. Even within the framework of the new âred lines,â there may still be room for a deal. China might agree to purchase more American goods, with America yielding on the retention of tariffs, and the unilateral right to impose tariffs later. However, the degree of difficulty in getting to an agreement has now increased substantially.
The bottom line is that nationalism is not just a factor in Trumpâs America. Itâs now a big factor in Xi Jinpingâs China as well, reinforced through the prism of Chinese history. In most of its dealings with America over the last 100 years, China has seen itself as weak. Today, in Beijingâs view, China is weak no longer.

"A âBridgeâ to China, and Her Familyâs Business, in the Trump Cabinet","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244174897?accountid=14586,"The email arrived in Washington before dawn. An official at the American Embassy in Beijing was urgently seeking advice from the State Department about an âethics question.â
âI am writing you because Mission China is in the midst of preparing for a visit from Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao,â the official wrote in October 2017.
Ms. Chaoâs office had made a series of unorthodox requests related to her first scheduled visit to China as a Trump cabinet member, according to people with knowledge of the email. Among them: asking federal officials to help coordinate travel arrangements for at least one family member and include relatives in meetings with government officials.
In China, the Chaos are no ordinary family. They run an American shipping company with deep ties to the economic and political elite in China, where most of the companyâs business is centered. The trip was abruptly canceled by Ms. Chao after the ethics question was referred to officials in the State and Transportation Departments and, separately, after The New York Times and others made inquiries about her itinerary and companions.
âShe had these relatives who were fairly wealthy and connected to the shipping industry,â said a State Department official who was involved in deliberations over the visit. âTheir business interests were potentially affected by meetings.â
The move to notify Washington was unusual and a sign of how concerned members of the State Department were, said the official, who was not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency.
[The Chao family has deep ties to the worldâs two largest economies. Here are five takeaways .]
David H. Rank, another State Department official, learned of the matter after he stepped down as deputy chief of mission in Beijing earlier in 2017. âThis was alarmingly inappropriate,â he said of the requests.
The Transportation Department did not provide a reason for the tripâs cancellation, though a spokesman later cited a cabinet meeting President Trump had called at the time. The spokesman said that there was no link between Ms. Chaoâs actions as secretary and her familyâs business interests in China.
Ms. Chao has no formal affiliation or stake in her familyâs shipping business, Foremost Group. But she and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have received millions of dollars in gifts from her father, James, who ran the company until last year. And Mr. McConnellâs re-election campaigns have received more than $1 million in contributions from Ms. Chaoâs extended family, including from her father and her sister Angela, now Foremostâs chief executive, who were both subjects of the State Departmentâs ethics question.
Over the years, Ms. Chao has repeatedly used her connections and celebrity status in China to boost the profile of the company, which benefits handsomely from the expansive industrial policies in Beijing that are at the heart of diplomatic tensions with the United States, according to interviews, industry filings and government documents from both countries.
Now, Ms. Chao is the top Trump official overseeing the American shipping industry, which is in steep decline and overshadowed by its Chinese competitors.
Her efforts on behalf of the family business â appearing at promotional events, joining her father in interviews with Chinese-language media â have come as Foremost has interacted with the Chinese state to a remarkable degree for an American company.
[Read about how The Times decides what to investigate .]
Foremost has received hundreds of millions of dollars in loan commitments from a bank run by the Chinese government, whose policies have been labeled by the Trump administration as threats to American security. The companyâs primary business â delivering Chinaâs iron ore and coal â is intertwined with industries caught up in a trade war with the United States. That dispute stems in part from the White Houseâs complaints that China is flooding the world with subsidized steel, undermining American producers.
Foremost, though a relatively small company in its sector, is responsible for a large portion of orders at one of Chinaâs biggest state-funded shipyards, and has secured long-term charters with a Chinese state-owned steel maker as well as global commodity companies that guarantee it steady revenues.
In a rarity for foreigners, Angela and James Chao have served on the board of the holding company for China State Shipbuilding, a state-owned enterprise that makes ships for the Chinese military, along with Foremost and other customers. Angela Chao is also on the board at the Bank of China, a top lender to the shipbuilder, and a former vice chairman of the Council of Chinaâs Foreign Trade, a promotional group created by the Chinese government.
Angela Chao, speaking in an interview in New York on Friday, said that her board positions were unremarkable, emphasizing that Foremost did business around the world. She denied that the company had a âChina focusâ beyond what most dry bulk carriers have in a world dominated by Chinese manufacturing. âWe are an international shipping company, and Iâm an American,â she said, adding, âI donât think that, if I didnât have a Chinese face, there would be any of this focus on China.â
James Chao was not made available for an interview; a representative of the company received written questions from The Times two weeks ago, and the company responded with a fact sheet on Friday.
Though Foremost worked in the late 1960s on American government contracts to ship rice to Vietnam, according to James Chaoâs biography, it has almost no footprint left in the United States, save for a modest corporate headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. It registers its ships in Liberia and Hong Kong and owns them through companies in the Marshall Islands.
Since Elaine Chao became transportation secretary, records show, the agency budget has repeatedly called to cut programs intended to stabilize the financially troubled maritime industry in the United States, moving to cut new funding for federal grants to small commercial shipyards and federal loan guarantees to domestic shipbuilders.
Her agencyâs budget has also tried to slash spending for a grant program that helps keep 60 American-flagged ships in service, and has tried to scale back plans to buy new ships that would train Americans as crew members. (In China, Ms. Chaoâs family has paid for scholarships and a ship simulator to train Chinese seamen.)
Congress, in bipartisan votes, has rejected the budget cuts, some of which have been offered up again for next year. One opponent of the cuts has been Representative Alan Lowenthal, a California Democrat whose district includes one of the nationâs largest cargo ports.
âThe Chinese government is massively engaged in maritime expansion as we have walked away from it,â he said in an interview. âThere is going to come a crisis, and we are going to call upon the U.S. maritime industry, and it is not going to be around.â
Elaine Chao declined to be interviewed, but the Transportation agency provided a written statement from her.
âMy parents and I came to America armed only with deep faith in the basic kindness and goodness of this country and the opportunities it offers,â Ms. Chao said. âMy family are patriotic Americans who have led purpose-driven lives and contributed much to this country. They embody the American dream, and my parents inspired all their daughters to give back to this country we love.â
The department spokesman said The Timesâs reporting wove âtogether a web of innuendos and baseless inferencesâ in linking Ms. Chaoâs work at Transportation to her familyâs business operations.
Agency officials said the department under Ms. Chao had been a champion of the American maritime industry, adding that several proposed cuts had been made by previous administrations and that the Trump administration had since moved to bolster funding.
Ms. Chao, 66, was born in Taiwan to parents who had fled mainland China in the late 1940s and later settled in the United States when she was a schoolgirl. She worked at Foremost in the 1970s but has had no formal role there in decades.
As her political stature has grown â she has served in the cabinet twice and has been married to Mr. McConnell for 26 years â Beijing has sought to flatter her family. A government-owned publisher recently printed authorized biographies of her parents, releasing them at ceremonies attended by high-ranking members of the Communist Party. On a visit last year to Beijing, Ms. Chao was presented with hand-drawn portraits of her parents from her counterpart in the transportation ministry.
The Chao familyâs ties to China have drawn some attention over the years. In 2001, The New Republic examined them in the context of the Republican Partyâs softening tone toward the country. When Ms. Chao was nominated as transportation secretary, ProPublica and others highlighted the intersection of her new responsibilities with her familyâs business. And in a book published last year, the conservative author Peter Schweizer suggested the Chaos gave Beijing undue influence.
The Times found that the Chaos had an extraordinary proximity to power in China for an American family, marked not only by board memberships in state companies, but also by multiple meetings with the countryâs former top leader, including one at his villa. That makes the Chaos stand out on both sides of the Pacific, with sterling political connections going to the pinnacle of power in the worldâs two biggest economies.
Ms. Chaoâs father, a founder of Foremost in 1964, has for decades cultivated a close relationship with Jiang Zemin, a schoolmate from Shanghai who rose to become Chinaâs president. As the schoolmates crossed paths again in the 1980s, the Chaos reaped dividends from a radar company linked to Mr. Jiang that targeted sales to the Chinese military, documents filed with the Chinese government show.
Though Ms. Chaoâs financial disclosure statements indicate she receives no income from Foremost, she made at least four trips to China with the company in the eight years between her job as labor secretary during the George W. Bush administration and her confirmation as transportation secretary in January 2017. And her father accompanied her on at least one trip that she took as labor secretary, in 2008, sitting in on meetings, including with Chinaâs premier, one of the countryâs top officials.
Public records show that she has benefited from the companyâs success. A gift to Ms. Chao and Mr. McConnell from her father in 2008 helped make Mr. McConnell, the Republican majority leader, one of the richest members of the Senate. And three decades worth of political donations have made the extended family a top contributor to the Republican Party of Kentucky, a wellspring of Mr. McConnellâs power.
âThis is a family with financial ties to a government that is a strategic rival,â said Kathleen Clark, an anti-corruption expert at Washington University in St. Louis. âIt raises a question about whether those familial and financial ties affect Chao when she exercises judgment or gives advice on foreign and national security policy matters that involve China.â
A Family Business on the Rise
Four enormous gantry cranes rise on the banks of the Yangtze River near the East China Sea. In their shadow thousands of workers assemble cargo ships, each about as long as three football fields.
It is here, at the Shanghai Waigaoqiao shipyard, that Foremost Groupâs newest ship, the Xin May, was built. Six similar ships are set to be built in the next several years, all part of an order by Foremost announced in December 2017 at the Harvard Club in New York.
Foremost first placed an order with the state-owned company in 1988 and over the decades has been its biggest North American customer, according to the shipbuilder. The relationship is so tight that Foremostâs offices in Shanghai are in the shipbuilderâs 25-story tower.
âWe are committed to continuing to build ships in China,â Angela Chao said at the Harvard Club announcement, which was attended by the top official in Chinaâs New York consulate. âMy father was a pioneer in internationalizing the Chinese shipbuilding market, and it has been over 30 years that he has continuously ordered ships in China.â
Foremost has relied on the Export-Import Bank of China, or China EximBank, to finance at least four ships in the past decade. Its loans often come with lower interest rates and more generous repayment schedules than those made through some commercial lenders. As of 2015, the bank had made at least $300 million available to Foremost, it said at the time.
Angela Chao, in the interview with The Times, said that 2015 was the last year the company borrowed from the lender, describing its terms as less attractive than those of non-Chinese banks. She said the company never borrowed â ânot even closeâ â $300 million, a figure she had not previously heard. âThey are not a big part of our financing,â she said.
The Chao familyâs connections run deep with the Chinese leadership, documents in China show.
As civil war raged across the country in the 1940s, Mr. Chao attended Jiao Tong University in Shanghai. A schoolmate was Mr. Jiang, who stayed in China after the Communist victory and ultimately became president. Mr. Chao went with the defeated Nationalists to Taiwan, where he became the youngest person to qualify as a shipâs captain, according to his biography.
Mr. Chao left for the United States in 1958, but a thaw in relations sparked by President Richard M. Nixon drew him back to his homeland in 1972, the first of a flurry of trips that established him as a successful member of the Chinese diaspora.
Mr. Chao got exceptional access. In 1984 he was invited to Beijing to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Peopleâs Republic and meet with the countryâs top leader, Deng Xiaoping, according to materials at a museum in Shanghai dedicated to Mr. Chaoâs wife, Ruth Mulan Chu Chao, who died in 2007.
Also in 1984, as China emerged from decades of political and economic turmoil, Ruth Chao bought a stake in a Chinese company that manufactured marine equipment, including radars, in partnership with Raytheon, the American defense contractor, according to Chinese corporate documents.
The investment, not previously reported, was held by a Panamanian company. The Chinese company, documents show, praised the âsupport for the construction of the nationâ shown by Ruth Chao, identifying her as Jamesâs wife and both of them as American citizens.
The now-defunct company targeted the Chinese military for sales of some of its gear, and a principal partner was a state-owned factory under the Ministry of Electronics Industry, which was led at the time by Mr. Jiang, according to corporate documents and a former employee. The employee, Zheng Chaoman, recalled the involvement of âthe father of Elaine Chao.â
Within months, it generated enough revenue for Mr. Chao to donate profits to a foundation he had established in Shanghai, according to an announcement by the local government. The foundation sponsors training scholarships for merchant seamen, his wifeâs biography said.
In the aftermath of the deadly suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square in June 1989, the Chaos asked to divest their 25 percent stake in the company. Two months earlier, Elaine Chao had been confirmed by the Senate to a senior political appointment, as deputy transportation secretary under President George H. W. Bush.
The Transportation Department spokesman said Ms. Chao did not know anything about the venture. Angela Chao, in the interview, said her father did not âremember any ownership, and we canât find anything on it.â
The familyâs other business ties in China remained, including work that year by China State Shipbuilding on two new cargo ships for Foremost.
That August, Mr. Chao met with Mr. Jiang, who had been named general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the countryâs most powerful position. Their hourlong meeting inside the leadership compound adjacent to the Forbidden City, together with the head of the state shipbuilding company, was described as âfriendlyâ in the official Peopleâs Daily newspaper.
The two former schoolmates would meet at least five more times during Mr. Jiangâs tenure as general secretary, according to a review of publicly available documents.
A Celebrity Face for the Company
As the first Chinese-American to serve as a cabinet secretary â eight years as labor secretary â Elaine Chao became an instant celebrity in China during the George W. Bush administration. Her family was a beneficiary of her newfound fame.
During a trip to China in August 2008 to represent the United States at the closing of the Olympic Games, Ms. Chao took her father to several official meetings with Chinese leaders, including one with the countryâs premier, Wen Jiabao, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. At the time, Mr. Chao was chairman of Foremost and a board member of China State Shipbuilding.
When she left government during the Obama years, she continued to put her celebrity status to use on behalf of the family business.
In 2010, she traveled to Shanghai with her father for the delivery ceremony of a cargo ship, the Bao May. The ship soon became a workhorse for Foremost, hauling raw materials to China from around the world under a seven-year charter with a subsidiary of a state-owned steel maker. Foremost paid for the Bao May and another ship with up to $89.6 million in loans from China EximBank, corporate records in Hong Kong show.
The next year, Ms. Chao was back in Shanghai for the launch of another ship, and in 2013, she traveled to Beijing with her father and her sister Angela for a meeting with the chairman of China State Shipbuilding, according to a company announcement.
Ms. Chao joined her family two years later at the signing of a loan for Foremost at China EximBankâs grand hall in Beijing. The loan, for $75 million, was made jointly with a Taiwanese lender to build two cargo ships.
The Transportation Department spokesman said it was âentirely appropriateâ for Ms. Chao to take her father to meetings in 2008 as her âplus-one,â and said her visits between her government posts were done as a private citizen.
Angela Chao said her sister attended Foremost events âas a family member.â
âForemost was founded in 1964; the company is 55 years old,â she added. âWe were around and we were well respected well before Elaine was in anything. We predate her; she doesnât predate us.â
The flurry of visits coincided with Foremostâs growing contributions to Chinaâs globalized steel and shipping industries.
Today, Foremostâs fleet, like many, primarily serves the Chinese market, hauling bulk cargo such as iron ore, coal and bauxite. Of the 152 voyages made by its ships between Jan. 1, 2018, and April 12, 2019, 91 have been to or from China, accounting for 72 percent of Foremostâs total tonnage during that period, according to figures compiled by VesselsValue, a company that tracks shipping data.
Angela Chao said that its ships were chartered to commodity companies such as Cargill, and that Foremost did not âcontrol where the ships go, so weâre like a taxicab.â
During her eight years out of government, Elaine Chao extended her connections in China, according to a review of Chinese websites and other public materials.
For example, she was appointed in 2009 to an advisory group in Wuhan, where the steel maker with the Foremost charter is based. Such appointments are largely ceremonial, but they can be sought after for the access they sometimes provide to local leaders.
That same year, she was granted an honorary professorship at Fudan University, and in 2010, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Jiao Tong University.
With Mr. Trumpâs election, Ms. Chao was asked to join the administration. During her confirmation hearing she did not discuss her familyâs extensive ties to the Chinese maritime industry, and she did not disclose the various Chinese accolades she had received. The Senateâs written questionnaire requires nominees to list all honorary positions.
âIt was an oversight,â the Transportation Department spokesman said.
A Budget at Odds With Congress
Ms. Chao has spoken repeatedly about her commitment to the American maritime industry, including during her confirmation hearing in 2017.
âIâm of an age where I have seen two wars in pivotal areas of the world,â she told the Senate Commerce Committee, with her father seated behind her. âIf we did not have the merchant marine assets to assist the gray hulls on these campaigns, the military naval campaigns, our country would not have been able to supply our troops, bring the necessary equipment.â
But without Congress putting up roadblocks, some of the Trump administrationâs budgetary actions proposed during her tenure would have reduced federal funding for programs that support the shipbuilding industry and ships that operate under American flags.
Plans drafted during the Obama administration had called for building up to five new, state-of-the-art ships big enough to train 600 cadets each to help the American military move equipment and supplies worldwide, especially during wartime.
But after Ms. Chao became secretary, the agencyâs budget proposed buying old cargo ships instead and renovating them. Congress balked at the cost-cutting measure â one Democratic lawmaker mocked the agencyâs plan to âbuy a bunch of rusty old hulksâ â and restored the funding.
More recently, the agency budget pushed to shrink the size of one of the new ships, again provoking bipartisan protests from Congress.
âGiven the administrationâs strong commitment to American manufacturing and to being sure that we can adequately control the seas, the targeting of programs that help the maritime industry remain strong doesnât make sense to me,â said Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican who leads the panel overseeing the Transportation Department budget. âIt seems inconsistent with the administrationâs overall goals.â
Ms. Collins added that the driving force behind these cuts had been the White House, not Ms. Chao, whom the senator called a âstrong advocateâ for the maritime program.
The agency budget in 2017 and 2018 also proposed reducing annual grants for the Maritime Security Program, which help American ships pay crews and cover the cost of meeting safety and training requirements.
It also moved in the last three years to eliminate new funding for a grant program that helps small shipyards stay in business, as well as a program that provides loan guarantees for the construction or reconstruction of American-flagged vessels.
Agency officials noted that many of the cuts were forced on the department by the White House, and that some of the same programs had been previously targeted, only to see the money restored by Congress, as happened with the Trump cuts.
Ms. Chao has supporters in the industry, citing her work to defend a federal program that allows only American-flagged ships to make deliveries between American ports, as well as the effort to replace training vessels, which has boosted the maritime unitâs overall budget.
âWe have a secretary who comes from the maritime industry â and that has translated into an understanding of the importance of the maritime academies,â said Jerry Achenbach, superintendent of the Great Lakes Maritime Academy in Michigan.
But objections continue, including questions about why, despite repeated promises, Ms. Chao has not issued a detailed strategic plan for stabilizing the United Statesâ shrinking fleet.
Fair Kim, a retired Coast Guard deputy commander who works at an association that promotes the American shipping industry, said Ms. Chao and the Trump administration had a disappointing maritime record.
âIf you preach America first, why not promote the U.S.-flagged fleet at the expense of foreign-flagged ships?â he asked. âThis administration should be very friendly to us.â
A China-Friendly Approach
The Trump administration has made the rivalry with China a core tenet of American foreign policy, concluding that decades of accommodation has reinforced the countryâs authoritarian rule and undermined the interests of the United States.
âBeijing is employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the United States,â Vice President Mike Pence said during a speech in October.
None of that, however, has kept Ms. Chao from maintaining China-friendly relations, including engaging with the Chinese media about her familyâs shipping business and multiple other subjects. During a televised interview, one prominent Chinese reporter, Tian Wei, described Ms. Chao as âa bridgeâ between Beijing and the Trump administration.
Ms. Chaoâs official calendar, obtained by The Times through a public records request, shows at least 21 interviews or meetings with Chinese-language news organizations in her first year as transportation secretary.
In November 2017, she met for lunch at her office with Ma Jing, then the top official in the United States for CGTN, the China state television network.
The network has been under growing pressure from the Justice Department to detail its ties to the Chinese state as part of a stepped-up enforcement of foreign influence laws, and in March, Ms. Ma and a dozen other CGTN employees in Washington were reported to have been recalled to China.
In an interview in April 2017, Ms. Chao was photographed with her father next to a Transportation Department flag. Her father told the reporter how he had traveled on Air Force One and discussed âbusinessâ with the president.
He also took the opportunity to talk up his daughterâs new role in the administration. âItâs not just an honor for us Chinese,â Mr. Chao said to The China Press, a publication in the United States. âItâs an honor for Americans.â
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The interview was first highlighted by Politico, which noted that Ms. Chao had made multiple media appearances with her father.
Ms. Chaoâs schedule also shows that she attended an August 2017 event in New York celebrating the signing of a Foremost deal with Sumitomo Group, a Japanese company with mass transit projects in the United States, including California and Illinois, that fall under her oversight. The spokesman said she attended in a personal capacity and did not discuss agency business.
Marilyn L. Glynn, a former general counsel at the Office of Government Ethics, questioned Ms. Chaoâs proximity to Foremost, saying she should recuse herself from decisions that broadly impacted the shipping industry.
âShe might be tempted to make sure her family company is not adversely affected in any policy choices, or it might even just appear that way,â Ms. Glynn said.
The agency spokesman said that was not necessary because there was no conflict. âThe family business is not in U.S.-flag shipping,â he said. âThe trade routes are completely different; the ships are completely different.â
Ms. Chaoâs first trip to China as transportation secretary was made last April amid an escalating trade war, six months later than originally planned.
The original trip had been described by the department as a âbilateral meetingâ with Ms. Chaoâs Chinese counterpart to discuss disaster response, infrastructure and related subjects.
Eight days before the planned start of the October 2017 trip, when contacted by The Times, Ms. Chaoâs office said it could not provide a list of who would accompany her.
But the embassy in Beijing had received requests to accommodate Ms. Chaoâs family members, according to interviews with State Department officials involved in the planning, as well as a redacted email obtained by The Times through a public records lawsuit.
Angela Chao said in the interview that she was already planning to be in Beijing to attend a Bank of China board meeting, and that her husband, the investor Jim Breyer, also had business in the Chinese capital. But she said she was unaware of her sisterâs travel plans. Angela Chao was among the family members mentioned in the State Department discussions about the visit, according to a United States official.
The email, with the subject âethics question,â had come from Evan T. Felsing, a senior economic officer for the State Department in Shanghai. Mr. Felsing, now based in India, declined to comment.
Other correspondence also signaled unease among American diplomats over whom Elaine Chao intended to take on the trip and the topics they would discuss with Chinese officials. Emails indicate that ethics lawyers in both the State and Transportation Departments weighed in.
âThey would not have raised a question like this about a cabinet secretary unless it was something really serious,â said Mr. Rank, the former deputy chief of mission in Beijing, who resigned in protest over the Trump administrationâs environmental policy.
The agency spokesman confirmed a request on behalf of Ms. Chaoâs relatives, but did not say in his written response to questions whether they were scheduled to attend official government events.
When Ms. Chao finally traveled to China last April, no relatives were present.
She met with top leaders, including the premier, Li Keqiang. While there, she sought to soothe hard feelings between China and the Trump administration in an interview with a government-run broadcaster. She suggested some of the tensions resulted from cultural differences.
âAmerica is a very young country â itâs very dynamic â it doesnât have a long period of history,â she said in an interview with CGTN. âSo there are not so many rules and regulations in terms of behavior, whereas some other countries that have long histories, it may be a little bit more different. We have to understand the Chinese and how they see things, and I think the Chinese need to understand how America sees things.â
Even this trip did not proceed entirely by the book. Ms. Chao broke with the standard practice for government employees and flew on a Chinese state airline instead of an American carrier.
Ms. Chaoâs economy-class round-trip ticket with Air China cost $6,784, according to information obtained through a public records request. The flight was booked through a code-share arrangement with United Airlines. A less expensive ticket was available on a nonstop United flight, according to an airline official.
The agency spokesman would not say what class Ms. Chao flew in, only that the ticket was booked in economy. The flight, he said, complied with federal law.
A Windfall for Mitch McConnell
When a delegation of local Chinese Communist Party leaders visited Washington in 2017, Ms. Chaoâs office arranged for them to be photographed with Ms. Chao and her father.
Her aides pulled another string.
âU.S. Capitol Tour for VIP Guests,â read the subject line of an email sent by Ms. Chaoâs aides to the staff of her husband, Mr. McConnell.
The senatorâs staff obliged, arranging an âoff limitsâ tour for Ms. Chaoâs guests, who were visiting from the home region of her mother.
âThe delegation was thrilled to get the VIP treatment by your office and were particularly excited to hear that the leaderâs office was normally off limits to normal guests,â an aide to Ms. Chao later wrote to Mr. McConnellâs staff.
It was a small favor, but one that reflected the political partnership at the center of the marriage between Ms. Chao and Mr. McConnell.
In 1989, shortly after their first date (at the Saudi ambassadorâs home near Washington), Mr. McConnell was preparing for a re-election campaign. Greetings from Ms. Chao came in classic Washington fashion: a string of campaign donations, totaling $10,000, from Ms. Chao, her father, her mother, her sister May and Mayâs husband, Jeffrey Hwang, according to Federal Election Commission records.
Over the next 30 years, the extended Chao family would be an important source of political cash for Mr. McConnell, himself one of the most formidable Republican fund-raisers in American politics.
The extended Chao family is among the top donors to the Republican Party of Kentucky, giving a combined $525,000 over two decades.
One of Ms. Chaoâs sisters, Christine, the general counsel at Foremost, was the second-biggest contributor to the super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership in 2014. She gave $400,000 to the organization, which identified Mr. McConnellâs re-election as its highest priority that year.
In all, from 1989 through 2018, 13 members of the extended Chao family gave a combined $1.66 million to Republican candidates and committees, including $1.1 million to Mr. McConnell and political action committees tied to him, according to F.E.C. records.
âIâm proud to have had the support of my family over the years,â Mr. McConnell said in a statement.
The familyâs wealth has also benefited Mr. McConnell personally. In 2008, Ms. Chaoâs father gave the couple a gift valued between $5 million and $25 million, according to federal disclosures. Mr. McConnell, never a wealthy man, vaulted up the moneyed rankings in the Senate; as of 2018 he was the 10th wealthiest senator, according to Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper. David Popp, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said the gift from Mr. Chao was in honor of Elaine Chaoâs mother.
Over the years, Mr. McConnell has also participated in Chao family events and trips related to the familyâs business and charitable giving.
In 1993, he and Ms. Chao traveled with her father to Beijing at the invitation of China State Shipbuilding and met top officials.
He celebrated Foremostâs 50th anniversary in 2014 at the Harvard Club in Manhattan, witnessing the signing of a contract with a Japanese shipbuilder.
And he attended the dedication in 2016 of a building at the Harvard Business School named after Ms. Chaoâs mother. Ms. Chao and three of her sisters had attended the school.
Mr. McConnellâs connection to the family was hard to miss when a reporter recently visited the Foremost headquarters in Manhattan. There, in the reception area, were two gray pillows emblazoned with the seal of the United States Senate.

"In China, Public Talk of Sex Is Rare. Could a âPleasure Communityâ Change That?","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244175352?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â In a room with soft lighting, decorated with fuzzy blankets and turquoise balloons, a group of 30 or so strangers gathered on a recent afternoon in Beijing to discuss a subject that is largely taboo in China: how to satisfy a woman sexually.
Such a workshop would hardly be out of place in New York or San Francisco.
But in China, public discussion of sex is mostly nonexistent. Sex education is typically glossed over in Chinese classrooms and usually limited to one or two âphysical hygiene in pubertyâ lessons in biology class. Parents often avoid discussing the subject with their children altogether.
Many young Chinese say the only opportunities to learn about sex come from talking with their friends or watching pornography, so the workshopâs participants found themselves in an unusual environment.
At the entrance stood a billboard that was bubble gum pink and emblazoned with a message in Chinese characters: âHere, you will complete your sexual transformation!â
The room was an oasis of calm amid the usual city grind, with matcha-flavored cookies on offer â and carefully arranged displays of pink sex toys and purple vibrators.
âItâs very rare for us to have opportunities to learn about sex,â said Zhang Xiaoxiao, 22, a graduate student.
âIâve always wondered why my reactions during sex were different than the people in the porn videos,â Ms. Zhang added after the workshop, as her boyfriend, a 25-year-old financier, Xue Lei, nodded in agreement. âBut now I understand better.â
Leading the event was Zhao Jing, the founder of Yummy, a Chinese company that sells adult toys and that offers online and offline sex education courses and workshops.
Ms. Zhao, who goes by the name Sanmu (a Chinese version of her chosen English name, Sam), guided the attendees in a wide-ranging three-hour discussion of womenâs erogenous zones, the difference between sex in pornography and in reality and, of course, the best positions for reaching female orgasm.
A woman in a leopard-print jacket said she sometimes felt shy about taking the lead during sex, asking the crowd how she could become braver.
âDonât overthink it, just do it!â shouted a man in a baseball hat who was sitting at another table. Laughter rippled through the audience.
The event was part of a series of workshops organized by Yummy that aim to create what Ms. Zhao calls a âpleasure communityâ â or a safe and positive space for Chinese of all ages and sexual orientations to learn about sex, particularly from a female perspective. It is also an opportunity for Yummy to promote its online courses.
The participants included software engineers, bankers, college students and marketing specialists. Most were women, though a few men also attended, eager for advice about pleasing their partners.
âI want people to feel confident and happy when they talk about sex,â Ms. Zhao, 36, said in an interview at a cafe before the workshop. âBecause only when you know the joy and pleasure of something will you want to try it.â
And she stressed how the workshop could help make up for the lack of sex education. âBecause there is no sex education, people are just experimenting with their own bodies,â she said.
Chinese feminists have been pushing for women to retake control of their own bodies from the government, which enforced a strict âone childâ policy for more than three decades, only to reverse course in 2015 in the face of a rapidly graying population.
âTo put it bluntly, the birth of a baby is not only a matter of the family itself, but also a state affair,â the official newspaper Peopleâs Daily said in an editorial last year.
Research shows an alarming lack of knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases and contraception among young Chinese.
According to a 2015 study by the United Nations Population Fund, half of Chinese teenagers who had had sex said they didnât use contraception the first time. Official statistics show that nearly half of the nine million women who had abortions in China in 2017 were under the age of 25. And new cases of H.I.V. among students between 15 and 24 years old rose by more than one third every year from 2011 to 2015, according to an official study.
Ms. Zhao is determined to help young people be smarter and more in touch with their bodies.
A native of a small town in the southern Chinese province of Hunan, Ms. Zhao identifies herself as queer and said she became interested in learning about the body when she made that realization as a teenager.
In 2012, Ms. Zhao moved to the United States for a two-year masterâs program in interaction communications technologies at New York University. For her graduation project, which became the foundation for Yummy, she interviewed prominent sex educators like Betty Dodson (the âgodmother of masturbationâ) and Cindy Gallop, founder of MakeLoveNotPorn.tv.
Not long after Ms. Zhao moved back to China in 2015, she started Yummy, whose app features an online shop that sells lingerie and sex toys designed specifically for women, including vibrators and handcuffs.
Since March, Yummy has also organized six female orgasm workshops in cities across China. The workshops come at a fraught time for feminism here. In recent years, as the Communist Party under the leadership of Xi Jinping has tightened its grip on civil society, the space for activism â including feminist activism â has shrunk rapidly.
While Yummy and Ms. Zhao are not political, they have encountered problems with Chinese censors. Ms. Zhao estimates that 25 percent of Yummyâs online articles are deleted by censors, who tend to be especially sensitive to sexually explicit content. Recently, the control âhas only gotten stricter,â she said.
But at the recent Beijing workshop, there was no censorship â only a circle of trust. Though most attendees did not know one another, they spoke openly about their own anxieties and concerns.
A man in a bright yellow hoodie described how he had been able to have sex with his partner only once a year for the past few years because of constant stress.
An older woman with a pixie haircut spoke about struggling to rekindle the sexual spark in her marriage. âI just want to find a way to rediscover my body,â she said.
Throughout the workshop, Ms. Zhao played the part of both knowledgeable teacher and soothing therapist, offering advice and reassuring attendees that they were not alone in their concerns. Other participants chimed in spontaneously with tips.
At the end, Ms. Zhao invited participants on stage and presented each with a certificate to mark the completion of a âsexual transformation.â Afterward, the group scattered into the Beijing night, toting goody bags filled with condoms and lubricant.

"For Chinaâs Leading Investigative Reporter, Enough Is Enough","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244150547?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Late at night, a senior police officer guided Liu Wanyong, then a budding investigative journalist, through the inner sanctum of one of the scariest domains in China, the Ministry of Public Security.
The rooms were empty. Mr. Liu was directed to a locked filing cabinet.
The officer pulled out a dossier, laid the documents on a desk and â this being the era before cellphone cameras â gave Mr. Liu 30 minutes to scratch down the contents.
The documents laid out the story of an innocent businessman who had been jailed for the crimes of a corrupt politician. Thatâs news in most places, but not of the stop-the-presses variety. But in China in 2005, a leak like that was rare, and Mr. Liuâs account of how a party official had used his power to arrest an innocent man created a sensation.
Eventually, the businessman was released and the politician, a retired Communist Party secretary, went to prison, though not before his supporters attacked Mr. Liu outside the courthouse. For that story, and many others, Mr. Liu earned the nickname âTibetan Mastiffâ for his perseverance at the China Youth Daily, a paper run by the Communist Party but with a reputation for sometimes bending the rules.
More than a decade later, Mr. Liu, 48, has quit journalism. More than just a personal decision, however, his departure from the newspaper where he worked for 21 years represents the end of investigative journalism in China, a profession left in tatters by the pressure of Communist Party orthodoxy under President Xi Jinping.
Mr. Liu was about the last person standing of a group of hard-hitting journalists who worked at places like Southern Weekly and Caixin, the standard bearers of truth-seeking journalism that ebbed and flowed before Mr. Xi came to power.
The departure of Mr. Liu meant investigative journalism would never be the same, a social media account run by Chinese reporters declared. He was the pillar of the trade, it said, adding: âThe most important figure in investigative journalism has disappeared.â
âIf China wants to develop in a healthy, normal way, we must have a huge amount of media that can report justly,â Mr. Liu said as he poured tea in his spartan new office at an asset management firm where he is tending to the company image. He has given up the T-shirt and baggy pants look of the newsroom for a white open-neck business shirt and tailored trousers cinched by a big belt.
âBut news is not like news anymore,â he said, and âjournalism isnât like journalism.â
His decision was a reluctant one, forced upon him, he says, by a tightening vise of censorship, as at least 100 âjuicyâ stories were killed at the Youth Daily in the past two years. He grew weary of the response âjust waitâ â code, he says, for âDonât even dream of tackling this topicâ â when he discussed story ideas with editors.
Sometimes, journalists were silenced, forbidden to write for months as punishment for writing articles that ran afoul of the censors. The journalists were then compelled to compile reports confessing their mistakes.
Instead of investigations, the party wanted âpositive-energy storiesâ that would make people feel good as the economy sours, he said.
In the last year, accounts of the turmoil around financial scams that cost millions of people their savings were banned in the interests of âsocial stability.â The facts behind a huge explosion at a chemical factory were never explained.
âThe question of who is responsible is one of the first things people want to know in a calamity like that,â Mr. Liu said. âBut if you read our news, do you find this out? No.â The propaganda chiefs demanded articles about the blast that told people how to remain safe, a ludicrous notion since the explosion had already done its damage.
The toughened controls on journalists began after Mr. Xi became president in 2012. It became impossible to chase criminal and corruption cases in ways that were independent from the prosecutors, Mr. Liu said. âNow, you just record the process,â he said. âThe governmentâs policy is that the government decides anticorruption cases, not the journalist.â
In early 2016, Mr. Xi visited the main media outlets: Peopleâs Daily, Xinhua news agency and the state-run television network, CCTV. During the highly publicized events, he resurrected the Communist edict that journalists reflect the will of the party. Editors interpreted that to mean that Mr. Xiâs political thought was central to all articles. That was the official beginning of the end for independent reporting.
A 2016 survey by Zhang Zhian, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, had already shown a dramatic drop in the ranks of experienced journalists, with more than half fleeing to other professions.
âThere is hardly any reporting in China now,â said Zhan Jiang, a former professor of journalism at Beijingâs Foreign Studies University. âWe have returned to the propaganda of the Mao era.â
Mr. Liu, 48, was born into poverty in a village less than an hour from the center of Beijing. As the youngest of seven children of an illiterate mother, he never went to the capital until he was in his late teens. There were no books in the house, and well into the 1980s the family dumped human feces in the fields as fertilizer.
âMy parents didnât even know what news was,â he said.
He was young enough to miss the Cultural Revolution, when the schools were closed, but was forced to learn Chinese under a reign of terror imposed by a harsh teacher. âEvery day you lived in fear of having your palm hit by the teacherâs stick,â he said.
In college, he showed a flair for journalism, writing campus news in the style of Xinhua, the state-run news agency. He tried out for a job at the China Youth Daily, and sailed through a test that required writing both in everyday Mandarin and classic Chinese.
âThe core of being a journalist is that you need to love your job,â he said. âThe text of the story is not so important. You either have compassion for the lower class or you donât.â
At the China Youth Daily, Mr. Liu rapidly proved adept at unveiling the corrupt links between politicians and businessmen. After the 2005 case, more leaks came his way, and he built a cadre of reporters into an investigative unit. One of his favorite articles foreshadowed the college admissions scandal that erupted in the United States this year.
It involved the daughter of an influential politician who lacked the grades to go to college. Mr. Liu showed how she had used the identity of a much better student to dupe admissions officers into granting her a place. After that, the Ministry of Education began requiring photo IDs on application paperwork.
His string of reports on corrupt politicians burnished his paperâs reputation and helped build its circulation. He kept at it as the censorship screws tightened, writing even last year about a businessman who was seeking compensation for wrongly serving seven years in prison after himself being swindled by a provincial police chief. That was the last. His once flourishing unit has been reduced to two inactive journalists.
He has not entirely given up on journalism. He makes guest appearances at journalism classes, encouraging students to persist even in the current hostile environment. He offers a slew of tips on how to outwit the authorities. After checking into a hotel, he says, the first rule is to canvass the room for drugs that the police have planted, a time-honored trick to silence a journalist whose work is inconveniencing the powers that be.
Despite leaving journalism, Mr. Liu has remained true to his humble roots. He has barely traveled: a junket to the Seychelles with a party propaganda unit here; a trip to India there; and another to South Korea.
His passion remains the search for truth, or as close as he can get to it under such dire censorship.
âWhen I read the Chinese press, I know there are problems,â he said. âIn the trade war, when Trump said China had withdrawn from the agreement, there is no way the Chinese media can say what China retreated from. I read the information in the Western press.â

Hong Kongâs Government May Cave In to China. Its People Will Not.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244153571?accountid=14586,"If Hong Kongâs undoing comes much earlier than 2047, the year that the cityâs special arrangement with mainland China formally ends, it may be because of a love story that ended in murder.
On Sunday, several hundred thousand â possibly upward of one million â Hong Kong people marched to protest their governmentâs attempt to turn that single incident into an excuse to subjugate the city to the ever-encroaching authoritarianism of the Chinese authorities in Beijing.
Chan Tong-kai, a young man from Hong Kong, is wanted in the strangling death of his girlfriend while the couple was vacationing in Taiwan last year. He is back in Hong Kong and, though a suspect in the killing, cannot be sent to Taiwan to stand trial because Hong Kong and Taiwan do not have an extradition agreement. (Nor can he be tried in Hong Kong, whose courts do not have jurisdiction over crimes committed outside of the city.)
Carrie Lam, Hong Kongâs highest-ranking official, offered to solve the problem in March by proposing, and fast-tracking, a bill to amend existing extradition laws, which, among other things, would allow the rendition of criminal suspects between Taiwan and Hong Kong. She said this would improve the rule of law.
She also said she wished to âplug a loopholeâ by allowing a similar arrangement between Hong Kong and China â a loophole, another official lamented, that Hong Kong has ignored âlike an ostrich for 22 years,â or since Britain handed over control of the city to the Chinese authorities in Beijing.
For many Hong Kongers, the proposed bill hit like a political bombshell: It seemed to pave the way for China to target anyone in Hong Kong on almost any pretense and try them on the mainland. In the past, the Chinese authorities at least have had to stoop to ugly, and manifestly illegal, kidnappings to get their hands on their opponents in the city.
Various pro-democracy camps in Hong Kong and many legal professionals were quickly up in arms. So were some members of the business sector. Christian churches also cried out: Shipping copies of the Bible to the mainland could attract severe punishment under Chinese law. Even recent immigrants from China spoke up. Five years after the Umbrella Movement, the spirit of civic protest â for freedom, justice and democracy â is alive and well in Hong Kong.
And with reason. The threat posed by the extradition law is real. The Chinese authorities have forcefully endorsed it. Ms. Lamâs arguments for the new bill are weak. Her motives are suspect.
The Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, one of the laws now under scrutiny, was enacted in April 1997 (several months before the handover) and amended in 1999 (after the handover). Ms. Lamâs position is âself-evidently untrue and absurd,â Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, commented recently. âBoth Hong Kong and China knew very well that there had to be a firewall between our different legal systems,â he said.
A Taiwanese official has said that the Hong Kong authorities have ignored three requests by Taiwan for the two governments to figure out together a special arrangement to handle the Chan case, bypassing the need for any radical legislative changes in Hong Kong. The Lam administration has also ignored narrow alternative approaches proposed by Hong Kongâs top legal professionals.
It does so at its peril: Aside from the sheer number of protesters on the streets on Sunday, it also has to contend with concern from the business community, an essential constituency.
Jimmy Lai, a local media mogul and pro-democracy icon, has argued that if the bill passes, âHong Kong will just become another Chinese city ruled by the Communist Party.â Michael Tien, an old-money and pro-government tycoon, as well as other representatives of the business sector, have also expressed clear, if more polite, disagreement.
The extradition bill would apply retroactively, and many business people in Hong Kong who have, or once had, business operations in China may have paid bribes â or visited brothels or otherwise contravened Chinese law in ways that high-flyers there routinely do.
Hong Kongâs tycoons and major business leaders have long had an interest â and a say â in maintaining the rule of law in the city, if only because it makes for a more attractive investment climate. Thatâs one reason that back in 2003 some of them rallied around James Tien â then a member of the Executive Council, the local cabinet (and now an honorary chairman of the pro-business Liberal Party) âtooppose a controversial security bill under Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hong Kongâs mini-constitution.
Business people in Hong Kong have even more reason to fear the extradition bill today. It could both destabilize the cityâs business environment and expose them to reprisals or extortion by the Chinese authorities â especially if they have ties to the United States and the countryâs trade war with China continues to rev up.
Back in 2003, the security bill was defeated in the local Legislature, known as LegCo, by James Tien and other members of the Liberal Party â in part after a half million people protested in the streets.
Ms. Lam has tried to placate the business sector, and has gestured at a compromise by shortening the list of proposed crimes that would warrant extradition to China â excluding white-collar and business-related crimes. Major business groups seemed content enough with the changes â but not Mr. Tien. On Sunday night, after the march, he called on Ms. Lam in a Facebook post to shelve the extradition bill now that the âsilent majorityâ of Hong Kong had come out marching against it.
The Hong Kong government issued a statement that night urging that consideration of the bill proceed as planned. LegCo is scheduled to debate it again on Wednesday. As the legislative process continues, so too will the conflict.
LegCo has been rigged so that it now essentially does the executiveâs bidding â and the executive does Beijingâs bidding. But if the proposed amendments are Ms. Lamâs initiative, as she has maintained, she might have gone too far trying to please her masters in Beijing. Judging by the crowds on Sunday, Hong Kongersâ scorn for the government on the mainland may have reached new heights. This cannot be what Beijing wanted.

The Hong Kong Protests Are About More Than an Extradition Law,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244150515?accountid=14586,"If we are to believe Carrie Lam, the chief executive of the Hong Kong government, the hundreds of thousands of people who marched through the cityâs sweltering streets on Sunday just didnât get it. They may have thought they were protesting a proposal to allow extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, but, in Ms. Lamâs view, they failed to understand that the measure would ensure that the city did not become a haven for fugitives and that existing legal protections and human rights would remain in force.
And if we are to believe the press in mainland China, that vast throng was really âsome Hong Kong residentsâ who had been âhoodwinked by the opposition camp and their foreign alliesâ into opposing the legislation, to cite the version in China Daily, an organ of the Chinese Communist Party.
No, Ms. Lam and editors of China Daily, the people of Hong Kong were not âhoodwinked,â nor did they misunderstand this legislation.
They understand very clearly that the measure making its way through the local legislature, where pro-Beijing deputies hold sway, has nothing to do with bringing murderers to justice, and everything to do with breaking down the firewall between Hong Kongâs rule of law and mainland Chinaâs thoroughly politicized judicial system. They understand that the legislation represents a further encroachment by Beijing into the âhigh degree of autonomyâ Hong Kong was promised when Britain returned the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Ms. Lam, at least, did not publicly question the motives of the protesters, who came out in the biggest numbers since at least the 1997 handover. âI believe most of the protesters yesterday loved Hong Kong and came out for the sake of the next generation,â she said. In pledging to protect human rights, she at least acknowledged the core concern of the residents of every age and calling who so jam-packed the downtown streets that other people couldnât get out of subway stations.
Beijing, by contrast, showed its true colors by playing down the protests and spreading the shopworn canard that they were the work of âforeign forces.â
âWe firmly oppose any outside interference in the legislative affairsâ of the region, intoned the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, perhaps oblivious to the irony that the only interference was by his government.
Ms. Lam has not backed down on the extradition bill, and neither she nor the city legislature is likely to buck Beijing. Under Hong Kongâs limited democracy, the chief executive is approved by Beijing and only half the seats in the legislature are filled by popular vote, though Ms. Lam insisted on Monday that the extradition bill was not imported from the mainland.
The residents of Hong Kong demonstrated once again that they will not easily surrender the civil liberties they learned to regard as their self-evident due under British rule. Five years ago, protesters of the Umbrella Movement occupied central city streets for 79 days to demand more transparent elections. And in 2003, an effort to enact a package of laws prohibiting sedition, subversion and treason against the Chinese government was shelved after half a million residents poured into the streets in protest.
Hong Kongâs freedoms are a standing irritant to the Communist authorities in Beijing, who have not ceased chipping away at them. One example is a draft law to criminalize disrespect for the Chinese national anthem; another is the disappearance of people from Hong Kong into mainland custody.
The extradition measure was initially presented as needed to send a Hong Kong man to Taiwan, where he allegedly killed his girlfriend. But to the democracy-minded people of Hong Kong, this was only cover for a portion of the bill that would also allow extradition to mainland China, which would enable Chinese authorities to pry political foes from Hong Kong by leveling false accusations and demanding their extradition. That, in effect, would extend Chinaâs reach into Hong Kong and strip its residents of the protection of the law.
Sundayâs protesters vowed to be back in the streets when the bill next comes before the legislature. If Ms. Lam really believes they are acting out of concern for âthe next generation,â she would do well to heed them and shelve this cynical assault on Hong Kongâs rule of law.

Hong Kongâs Protesters Are Resisting China With Anarchy and Principle,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2250326632?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â The protests that have roiled Hong Kong for weeks, combining vast marches with small guerrilla operations of civil disobedience, are not the radical development that some say. They are a natural extension of protests past â an upgrade of the 2014 Umbrella Movementâs peaceful tactics of occupation. And they are a natural reaction to changing political circumstances, including a proposed bill that would allow, in effect, the extradition to mainland China of anyone in Hong Kong wanted by the Chinese authorities. The Chinese governmentâs power grab is accelerating the metabolism of the cityâs protest movement.
Most of the leaders of past protests have been sidelined. The academics Benny Tai Yiu-ting and Chan Kin-man, some pro-democracy legislators and other well-known activists have been imprisoned for their roles in the 2014 sit-ins. The so-called Fishball Revolution in 2016 brought some participants, like Edward Leung Tin-kei, lengthy sentences on rioting charges. Others are in exile abroad.
But the absence of these former leaders has had a liberating effect on protesters today. People organize spontaneously using social media and Telegram. Without the old elites, a massive gathering can rapidly splinter or spin off into small, nimble side operations â as happened on Thursday night, when after a big rally calling for support from world leaders attending the Group of 20 summit meeting this weekend, a few thousand protesters marched on to the cityâs police headquarters. There is no recognized figurehead to issue instructions, and the people wouldnât follow those anyway.
On June 21, thousands of protesters surrounded the police headquarters for the first time. They demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill, as well as the release of protesters who were arrested following an earlier clash with the police and the withdrawal of any rioting charges, which could mean long prison sentences, against them. The foreign mediaâs favorite icon of the Umbrella Movement, Joshua Wong, who had been released from a short detention just days earlier, addressed the crowd proposing that it vote on an internet forum about whether to continue the siege or leave. It didnât care for the idea or even much react to his presence.
Pro-democracy legislators, known locally as the pan-dems, arenât calling for any specific action; their role in the movement is largely supportive and protective. During the night of June 11-12, the police tried to prevent people from mobilizing by going into subway stations, stopping young pedestrians and searching their belongings. As anger mounted within the public, some lawmakers rushed to the scene to intervene. On June 21, Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, of the Labor Party, stepped in to mediate after protesters held up a police van and heckled the officers inside.
Yet if the movement is leaderless and anarchic, it isnât chaotic. It has guiding principles that allow participants to self-regulate even as the movement constantly reinvents itself.
Among those principles is âä¸å²å¸­â (âdo not splitâ). Protesters use the expression to say that no one in the movement should condemn or obstruct the actions of fellow protesters they disagree with. People who oppose a given action should sit it out, but not try to prevent it.
The use of force, in particular, is a divisive issue. Some insist on the necessity of keeping the protests peaceful, so that they will seem morally legitimate and may gain sympathy from the broader public. Others â especially younger protesters or protesters who consider that the lengthy sit-ins of the Umbrella Movement failed â believe that some measure of force has become necessary; otherwise, the government will simply ignore them.
The âdo not splitâ idea acts as a bridge between these two factions by promoting mutual respect for diverging views within the protest movement. Not everyone embraces this code of conduct either, but it seems to be prevailing so far. And with good results: The movement remains cohesive despite being disparate. The more radical protesters at the front lines have also largely behaved with restraint â rationally and tactically. They have provoked the police, sometimes forcefully, but not with outright violence.
There was a great turnout for the first big march against the extradition bill on June 9 â about one million people, the cityâs largest demonstration until then â but it also felt like something of a last gasp. That night, some younger protesters werenât done and didnât want to go home. They went to the Legislative Council building with no plan and hardly any equipment. They knew only that they couldnât let the bill be passed â or even discussed, as planned, on June 12. If it became law, Hong Kong would never be the same.
It was the Hong Kong police that lapsed into violence on June 12, beating protesters and journalists, and firing off 150 rounds of tear gas against a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. The authorities have since said they were considering just five people on riot-related charges. Officers also lost control emotionally, throwing curses and obscenities at protesters and journalists. (Now there are T-shirts with the slurs.) A few days later, two million Hong Kongers marched again, once more against the extradition bill â which the government had suspended but not fully withdrawn â but this time also against police brutality.
The protestersâ most powerful weapon is the policeâs own violence. Or to put the point more bleakly: If the police hadnât been violent on June 12, would the bill have been suspended?
For years, only peaceful protests have seemed acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. But thatâs because until recently they havenât had to pay the full price for their opinions about politics in Beijing.
During British colonial times, many Hong Kong people identified with mainland China, the motherland, and were deeply interested in developments there. But colonialism also acted as a shield. The British authorities quashed Communist-led riots in 1967. And Hong Kongers could support the student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 without risking any reprisals. They were patriotic from a safe distance.
But after the British handed formal control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, and as political and economic pressure from China intensified, more and more people in the city have identified as Hong Kongers rather than as Chinese, Chinese living in Hong Kong or Hong Kong-Chinese. They have also increasingly borne the brunt of the Chinese governmentâs growing authoritarianism.
Hong Kongers are finally beginning to emancipate themselves from their old views. But the process is still at an early stage.
Although two million Hong Kongers â another record â took to the streets on June 16 against the prospect of being subjected to Chinese law, not many would say that they want independence for Hong Kong. Even opponents of the extradition bill and veteran proponents of democracy cling to the notion that âone country, two systemsâ â the principle that formally governs relations between Hong Kong and the mainland, and that is supposed to protect the cityâs relative autonomy â still means something. But what is the refusal to be ruled by another stateâs laws if not a call for self-governance or independence?
Hong Kongers may be bashful out of fear: The government in Beijing has made clear that it will not tolerate talk of independence. But many people hold these somewhat incoherent positions because they are still in denial.
These contradictions will not last, however; they cannot survive Chinaâs continued encroachment.
There is a lull at the moment. The police are staying put and officials out of view. Protesters are maintaining the pressure with small daily operations: momentarily disrupting public services, delivering petitions to consulates. They also seem to be hoping that President Trump can somehow pressure President Xi Jinping of China when the two leaders meet at the Group of 20 gathering this weekend.
But if nothing gives after the summit, if the Hong Kong government continues to reject the protestersâ demands, the situation will have to get more chaotic. People here know that time is not on their side. And Monday, July 1, is the anniversary of the cityâs handover from Britain to China.
This a moment of desperate hope. One-quarter of Hong Kongâs population has marched against Mr. Xiâs attempt to extend the Chinese Communist Partyâs absolute rule to the city.After that, how could things go back to normal?
China is likely to seek revenge for our recent audacity. But punishing Hong Kongers would only unite us further.

"As Protests Rock Hong Kong, Xi Jinpingâs View of History Shows He Will Dig In","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2252528345?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â When protesters in Hong Kong became more forceful on Monday, the Peopleâs Daily reprised a recent speech of Chinaâs leader, Xi Jinping, calling on party cadres to carry forward the struggle of the Communist revolution fought 70 years ago.
âWe must overcome all kinds of difficulties, risks and challenges,â he said.
It was the latest signal that Mr. Xi has no intention of bowing to the protestersâ demands for greater rights. On the contrary, the storming of Hong Kongâs legislature on Monday night seems to have given ammunition to hard-liners and prompted the sharpest denunciations in Beijing so far, suggesting the ruling Communist Partyâs patience was wearing thin.
âI think they have realized it is time to take measuresâ to restore order, Song Xiaozhuang, a professor in the Center for Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau at Shenzhen University, said in a telephone interview, referring to the authorities in Beijing.
âThis does not mean there is no patience, or that they want to get it done promptly, but it does mean that they cannot wait for long.â
Mr. Xi has not publicly addressed the political tumult in Hong Kong. Nor have officials disclosed any options they might be considering. But there is little doubt about Mr. Xiâs convictions, which are shaped by history and a deeply felt sense of the perils of popular uprisings.
âI have heard him talk at length, and passionately, about the challenges of governing China, and the need to maintain order in order to keep the country together,â said Ryan L. Hass, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as the director for China at the National Security Council during the Obama administration.
He noted that the mass protests that toppled authoritarian governments in North Africa and the Middle East in 2011 coincided with Mr. Xiâs ascent to the presidency and were âseared into his brain.â
Mr. Xiâs stance is not without risks, but he has governed with a millenarian sense of destiny, regularly exhorting the Communist Party to return to its original mission to transform a once-humiliated nation into the global power it is meant to be.
While the events in Hong Kong have generated considerable sympathy for the protesters, forcing the cityâs leader to back down and suspend a deeply unpopular bill that would allow extradition to China, Mr. Xi still has most of the advantages of power on his side.
Those include time and influence. The central government can still mobilize a vast network of supporters in Hong Kong, including civil servants and business people beholden to the central government, economically or politically.
In a last resort, there is also the Chinese military. Few analysts expect that Mr. Xi intends to use force, but few doubt that he would if security significantly deteriorated in the city.
The Peopleâs Liberation Army disclosed on Tuesday â certainly not by coincidence â that troops from its Hong Kong garrison had conducted training exercises last week. One photograph accompanying an article in the official military newspaper showed soldiers aboard a gunboat in Victoria Harbor, weapons drawn, with the cityâs skyline in the background.
After weeks of relative restraint, officials in Beijing have also begun to warn of grave repercussions. A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, warned that the defacing of the legislature was âa blatant challengeâ to Beijingâs red line: its sovereignty over the territory.
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Communist Party, called for âa zero-tolerance policy,â warning that more violence could open a Pandoraâs box.
That the protests in Hong Kong took place shortly following the 30th anniversary of the bloody suppression of the protests in Tiananmen Square and other cities in China has only hardened official views. This year is also the anniversary of the popular movements that swept Eastern Europe in 1989, toppling not only the Berlin Wall but also, ultimately, the Soviet Union itself two years later.
âThere has also been a tendency to present these struggles â and Tiananmen was presented this way â as not being spontaneous expressions of the popular will,â Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in an email, âeven in cases when that is clearly what they are.â Rather, he wrote, Beijing describes such protests as âillegitimate efforts by small sets of malcontents spurred on by mysterious foreign forces.â
Mr. Xi, who has steadily amassed greater power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, is acutely aware of that history.
âWhy did the Soviet Union disintegrate?â he asked in a secret speech in 2013 that later leaked. âWhy did the Soviet Communist Party collapse? An important reason was that their ideals and convictions wavered.â
He belittled the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for allowing it to happen on his watch. âIn the end, nobody was a real man,â he said then.
Weeks before the bloody crackdown protests in Tiananmen in 1989, Mr. Xi delivered a warning about the folly of popular mass movements, according to research by Joseph Torigian, an assistant professor at American University in Washington who is currently writing a book about Mr. Xiâs father.
âThis kind of âbig democracyâ,â Mr. Torigian quoted Mr. Xi as saying then, ââis not in accord with science, not in accord with the rule of law, but is instead in accord with superstition, in accord with stupidity, and the result is chaos.ââ Mr. Xi, a city official at the time, was speaking of the Cultural Revolution, but the message carries resonance today.
âWithout stability and unity, nothing is possible!â
As the partyâs leader, he has sought to extend its grip over virtually every corner of Chinese society, underscoring his view that stability can only be by eliminating threats to the partyâs rule.
Hong Kong has become such a symbol of Chinaâs success in reclaiming âlostâ territory, Julian G. Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University, said, that the government today would be âloath to admit any kind of limits to its sovereignty of this territory, lest it tarnish its success in recovering.â
When Britainâs foreign minister this week called on China to honor its commitments under the treaty that ceded British control of the city in 1997, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointedly replied that Britain no longer had any say in the matter.
Mr. Ku, who has written on Chinaâs adherence to the treaty, said the spokesmanâs bluntness was striking. âThey might have always had this legal position but they never, as far as I recall, said this sort of thing out loud.â
Allowing Hong Kong a greater degree of autonomy over its own affairs, as even some pro-Beijing lawmakers suggested, could open the Pandoraâs box, the Global Times warned. Hard-liners would argue that it would be seen as rewarding civil disobedience, which security officials on the mainland act quickly to snuff out, at times ruthlessly.
To be sure, Mr. Xiâs record of increasingly authoritarian rule â not least the detention of more than 1 million Muslims in Xinjiang â has raised alarms internationally about the direction he is taking China.
In Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing also considers part of China, the unrest in Hong Kong has further undermined the appeal that Mr. Xi made in January to unify under the same âone country, two systemsâ arrangement.
President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election next January, has styled herself as a defender of Taiwanâs sovereignty. Her standing in the polls rose following the Hong Kong policeâs heavy-handed response to protesters on June 12.
The protestersâ brief siege of the cityâs Legislative Council had echoes of the much longer occupation of Taiwanâs Parliament in 2014, which helped catapult Ms. Tsai to the presidency.
Mr. Wasserstrom said that the Communist Partyâs old saying, âToday, Hong Kong; Tomorrow, Taiwan,â now âhas a very ominous meaning.â

Hong Kong Protestersâ New Target: A News Station Seen as Chinaâs Friend,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2258470316?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â As a television journalist was trying to record video of a protest in Hong Kong last week, the protest suddenly became about him â and his employer.
Surrounding him, the young demonstrators waved signs in front of his camera that read âChange channels!â They also held up bottles of Pocari Sweat, a sports drink that has become an unlikely symbol of disdain for his news station, Television Broadcasts, better known as TVB.
TVB, Hong Kongâs dominant broadcaster, has been singled out for scorn by protesters, who accuse it of a pro-Beijing bias in its coverage of the political crisis roiling this semiautonomous Chinese region.
Analysts say TVBâs reporting has largely focused on how the protests have disrupted Hong Kongâs famed efficiency, while playing down the political frustrations that have driven people to the streets in large numbers.
The tension between the demonstrators and the station, whose broadcasts reach about 70 percent of Hong Kongâs population, touches on concerns that the cityâs status as a regional bastion for press freedom is being steadily undermined by the Communist Party in China, where media controls are strict.
âIt is a notorious television station and it always doesnât show comprehensive facts,â said Cheuk Ka-ho, 21, a university student who is active in the protest movement. âWe feel that over the years it has gotten worse as it keeps getting closer to China.â
The protests began in early June, when hundreds of thousands marched against legislation that would allow extradition to the Chinese mainland. Hong Kongâs leader, Carrie Lam, has since suspended the bill indefinitely, but protesters, including on Sunday, have continued to demand its full withdrawal, Mrs. Lamâs resignation and an independent inquiry into what they consider a brutal police response to some of the protests.
On July 1, some demonstrators escalated the conflict by storming, vandalizing and briefly occupying the Hong Kong legislature.
[A New York Times visual investigation suggests the police used excessive force in handling a previous protest.]
In TVB, protesters have found another front in their battle for Hong Kongâs future. They have organized boycotts of the network on social media and lobbied companies to withdraw advertisements from it.
The confrontation on Wednesday, when the TVB journalist was surrounded, was not an isolated incident. Last month, protesters heckled another TVB video journalist, unfurling umbrellas to block his camera and chanting, âTVB news, selling out the people of Hong Kong!â
The protesters accuse the broadcaster, which has a virtual monopoly on free-to-air TV rights in Hong Kong, and a senior executive who was once a top Communist Party official in Shanghai of deliberately marginalizing their movement, a charge that TVB rejects.
A Facebook group calling for boycotts of TVB has drawn more than 30,000 followers, and a petition criticizing the station has collected 100,000 signatures. Last week, the maker of Pocari Sweat, a Japanese sports drink popular in Hong Kong, pulled its advertising from TVB.
TVB has defended its coverage as accurate and impartial and accused protesters of threatening its advertising clients.
âPocari Sweatâs comments are designed to please protesters, which equals to bowing to violence,â the broadcaster said to a Chinese nationalist tabloid, Global Times, in comments that TVB verified as accurate.
A spokeswoman for TVB declined an interview request. But in a statement last month, the station said it was deeply regrettable that TVB reporters had been prevented from doing their jobs.
Hong Kongâs media landscape has become something of a battleground for the social divisions exposed by the political crisis, which could widen as the mass protests continue.
On one side is, essentially, TVBâs core demographic: older, conservative Hong Kong residents, who tend to sympathize with the police and see the protesters as troublemakers. At a rally in support of the police in late June, some demonstrators assaulted journalists from other local news outlets.
On the other side is a younger group, generally supportive of the protest movement and the pro-democracy politicians who are a minority in the local legislature. For them, TVBâs coverage confirms longstanding fears about Beijingâs growing influence over local affairs.
Some critics refer to TVB as âCCTV-B,â a mocking reference to China Central Television, Beijingâs main broadcaster of domestic propaganda. They point to TVBâs vice chairman, Li Ruigang, a media mogul from mainland China and one-time senior Communist Party official in Shanghai, as evidence of Beijingâs sway over the station. (Mr. Liâs company, China Media Capital Group, did not respond to a request for comment, but he has previously rejected such suggestions.)
The Hong Kong Journalists Association reported last year that mainland Chinese interests had direct control over, or stakes in, nine of Hong Kongâs 26 mainstream media companies, including TVB, up from eight a year earlier.
âEven though ownership is not concentrated in just a few hands, most of them have the same boss: the Communist Party,â Allan Au, a former TVB journalist who is now a media studies expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said of the cityâs pro-establishment media barons.
Ever since Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997, under a formula known as âone country, two systemsâ that promised a high degree of autonomy from Beijing, the city has distinguished itself from the mainland partly by nurturing the independence of its institutions, including the news media.
While the encroachment of Chinese interests has raised concerns, Hong Kongâs media landscape, to be sure, is still relatively free. Its journalists are among Asiaâs most combative, known to shout sharply worded questions at top city officials. Journalist groups have publicly opposed the extradition bill and accused the police of using excessive force against reporters who were covering protests.
TVB, for its part, has been less overtly antagonistic toward the protest movement than the cityâs two pro-Beijing newspapers, Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao. But compared to news outlets with a pro-democracy bent, like the newspaper Apple Daily and the online platform Stand News, it has generally been skeptical of the protesters.
The network âfocuses very much on disruptive behavior rather than on what they asked for, what they really want and whatâs behind that motivation,â said Gary Tang, a media studies expert at Hang Seng University in Hong Kong, referring to the protesters.
Critics note that TVB was the television outlet Mrs. Lam chose for an interview last month in which she compared dealing with the protesters to her own experience as a mother with a willful child â an analogy that enraged many of the demonstrators. On July 2, when TVB covered the aftermath of the storming of the legislature, it focused on the damage to the building and, unlike other news outlets, barely discussed the protestersâ demands.
Mr. Au said TVBâs closeness to mainland China was evident in the amount of airtime it devoted to reports about, for instance, President Xi Jinpingâs so-called Belt and Road Initiative of international trade and infrastructure links, at the expense of other types of reporting.
âThis is by design: The serious reporters donât have enough resources and time to devote to serious journalism,â Mr. Au said. âThis is what I call âstructural censorshipâ that confines the content without explicit censorship.â
Privately, some of the networkâs reporters and former staff members say they have felt caught in the middle. They are sympathetic to the protesters but resent being targeted over coverage decisions they say were made by their superiors.
âProtesters accuse TVB of brainwashing its loyal audience,â said Lam Yin-bong, a former TVB reporter who now works for Stand News. âBut these reporters and cameramen think: âFirst, Iâm on your side, and second, even if Iâm not, Iâm just doing my work in a professional manner.ââ
âThey would think: âThis is not my fault, so why are you targeting me?ââ he said.

You Canât Force People to Assimilate. So Why Is China at It Again?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2259104905?accountid=14586,"The Chinese governmentâs campaign of internment in the northwestern region of Xinjiang is extraordinary, by dint of its scale â but also, its contradictions.
Up to 1.5 million people from predominantly Muslim Turkic minorities â Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz â have been arbitrarily detained in political re-education camps designed in part to make them renounce their religious beliefs.
At times, the Chinese authorities have portrayed this mass detention campaign as a âstrict preventative measureâ against violent extremist ideologies. At others, they have called it a benign âvocational trainingâ initiative, comparing detainees to âboarding school students.â
But eyewitnesses â as well as the governmentâs own documents â reveal that these facilities are prisonlike internment camps that rely on intensive brainwashing procedures and forms of psychological torture. (There also have been reports of physical torture and rape.) Beyond the camps, the stateâs social re-engineering efforts involve systematically separating children from their parents and enlisting more and more adults in forms of forced labor.
Although China has occasionally faced violent resistance from some Uighur groups, notably terrorist attacks in Beijing in 2013 and Kunming in 2014, the re-education campaign in Xinjiang isnât really about combating extremism. (The United Statesâ antiterrorism czar, Nathan Sales, said as much earlier this month.) Those detained arenât just young men â the group most vulnerable to radicalization, it is thought â but also the elderly and pregnant women, as well as atheists and converts to Christianity. One can be interned for putting too much gas in oneâs car, refusing to smoke in public (abstention is taken to be a sign of piety) or receiving phone calls from relatives overseas. Members of ethnic minorities who said that they had tried everything to become âmodel Chinese citizensâ have reported that those efforts didnât save them from internment.
Why not? And why is the Chinese government repressing entire ethnic groups when such heavy-handed tactics are likely to only promote resistance and radicalization? And why is it willing to risk alienating Muslim governments in Central Asia and beyond even as President Xi Jinping has made the grand Belt and Road Initiative his flagship international project?
Because the Chinese Communist Party cannot not try to coerce assimilation. Its ultimate goal in Xinjiang â as elsewhere in China â is to exercise complete ideological supremacy, and that also entails trying to transform the very identity of the countryâs minorities. The C.C.P. lives in perennial fear that, short of having a complete grip on Chinese society, its long-term survival is in danger.
And so the C.C.P. is doubling down today on a campaign of forced assimilation in Xinjiang that has failed elsewhere in the past.
The partyâs current re-education drive is an upgraded version of the Cultural Revolution. This campaign, too, seeks to achieve ideological control by eradicating alternative ideological and belief systems. But it does so in a much more sophisticated and high-tech way. In Xinjiang, reams of personal information about Uighurs and other minorities are entered into police databases after being collected at checkpoints, through feeds from surveillance systems or during house visits.
Only this effort seems to ignore that one effect of the Cultural Revolution was to create a spiritual vacuum and that in the decades since China has experienced various spiritual revivals. Many Uighurs and Tibetans, as well as members of the Han majority, have ardently embraced both traditional and new beliefs.
The number of Christians in China is thought to have increased from 3.4 million in 1950 to about 100 million today â or more than the C.C.P.âs entire membership. Even C.C.P. members have either openly embraced a major religion or have anonymously admitted that they attend religious services, seek divination, burn incense or keep idols in their homes. Many of the devout see no contradiction between their faith and their patriotism or respect for the party.
Still, the C.C.P.âs campaign of assimilation today continues to target religion, because, in the partyâs eyes, religion, which tends to represent a personâs deepest allegiance, competes with loyalty to the state and undercuts the partyâs ideological foundation: materialism.
Chinaâs spiritual revival has thoroughly confounded the core Marxist assumption that economic development would naturally extinguish religious beliefs; in fact, it has occurred even as the country has been lifted out of poverty. Increasing wealth also seems to have fueled corruption, including within the C.C.P. â undermining the partyâs legitimacy and moral standing. The C.C.P. is now doubly on the ideological defensive.
The government, beyond targeting religion, has also tried to promote ethno-linguistic assimilation â again, through material incentives. Some minorities have pursued a Chinese language education in order to achieve upward social mobility. But many more have only become more entrenched in their distinct ethnic and religious identity.
Earlier this year, Tibetan nomads were told they could obtain state subsidies only if they replaced their altars devoted to Buddhist deities with images of Chinese political leaders. Likewise, Christian villagers in southeast China had previously been told to replace depictions of Jesus with portraits of President Xi if they wanted to continue to receive poverty-alleviation subsidies. Local officials then reportedly claimed, according to social media, that the initiative had successfully âmelted the hard iceâ in Christiansâ âheartsâ and âtransformed them from believing in religion to believing in the party.â
Had it, though? My research among Sinicized Tibetans, conducted between 2006 and 2008 in Qinghai Province, showed that even the more assimilated members of the group could become champions of the very ethnic identity they supposedly had renounced. A similar phenomenon seems to be occurring among Uighurs now.
To take one example: Mihrigul Tursun, a Uighur, told the United States Congress last year of her time in detention and compulsory Chinese-language education, âMy experience in this state program actually made me more conscious of my ethnic identity.â She has since become an outspoken activist.
An acquaintance of mine also said some Han Chinese in Xinjiang have told him that they believed the government was turning harmless minority citizens into hateful opponents â who will retaliate if they are ever released.
And yet the C.C.P. today has no choice but to believe that its re-education program can transform people into ideologically conforming citizens. Faced with the failure of more benign methods â improved living conditions, technological progress, state propaganda â it can only resort to repression.
Karl Marx predicted that capitalism would eventually collapse under the weight of its inherent contradictions. The C.C.P. seems no less vulnerable to its own contradictions: Its absolutist form of materialism, which aims to supplant religion and culture, has only intensified peopleâs yearning for religion and culture. Yet for now, it is desperately implementing its self-defeating ideology full throttle, and the effects in Xinjiang are devastating.

"Shunned by West and Wary of Russia, Belarus Gets Help From China","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2261978956?accountid=14586,"BREST, Belarus â There are no banners, no slogans or even raised voices, never mind fists.
But, for more than a year now, hundreds of protesters have gathered each Sunday to feed pigeons in Lenin Square and, in a heavily camouflaged show of dissent, to display their hostility to a Chinese-funded lead-acid battery factory that they say will spew deadly toxins into the air and groundwater.
The factory, already built on the outskirts of the western city of Brest but waiting permission to start production, has become a symbol of what its opponents see as an unhealthily close relationship between Beijing and the government of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, who has held power in Belarus since 1994.
Like President Vladimir V. Putin of neighboring Russia, Mr. Lukashenko brooks little dissent. He has also, like the Russian leader, looked increasingly to China for money and inspiration: Europe has lost of much of its sheen as an economic model, but China offers an example of how authoritarian politics can mix with robust economic growth.
âThey have made a huge leap forward. This is an example for us,â said Aliaksandr Yarashenka, the head of administration at a Chinese-funded industrial park now rising from what used to be a wasteland of pine trees and swamp near the capital city, Minsk.
The industrial park is the biggest such overseas venture financed by China, according to the state-run newspaper China Daily, which hailed Belarus as the âgateway to Europe,â although the country is not part of the European Union and any goods it produces are subject to steep tariffs if they enter Europe.
Mr. Yarashenka said the low cost of labor in Belarus, where average salaries are around $500 a month compared with $2,000 or more in the European Union, easily made up for the burden of tariffs and offered foreign companies a big incentive to set up export-oriented factories in his country.
Mostly shunned by European investors and wary of becoming too dependent on Russia, which has a record of trying to grab its prize assets, Belarus has eagerly turned to China. Beijing makes no demands on Mr. Lukashenko to ease repression or surrender companies like Belaruskali, a leading potash manufacturer over which Moscow has sought to gain control.
Belarusâs official news agency, BelTA, reported recently that the country was close to securing a loan of more than $500 million from China. It quoted the deputy finance minister, Andrei Belkovets, as saying that âwe initially counted on a loan from the Russian Federationâ but that Russia had stalled on providing funds, so âas an alternative weâve come to terms with Chinese creditors.â
In recent years, Chinese money has financed new roads, power plants, a luxury hotel in Minsk and, to the fury of the protesters in Brest, the lead-acid battery factory. Such batteries, widely used in cars, contain sulfuric acid and lead, both of which are highly toxic.
âFor the Chinese, we are like Africa â poor and needy,â said Vladislav Abramovich, a former doctor who lives in a forest settlement near the battery factory and worries about being poisoned. âAmerica and Europe wonât give money for dirty factories like this, but China doesnât care and wants business for Chinese companies.â
The pigeon-feeding protesters, a mix of people who live near the battery plant and environmental activists, have carefully avoided criticizing President Lukashenko, instead focusing their complaints on what they say are the grave health hazards posed by the plant and what they believe, without any clear evidence, is substandard Chinese equipment.
Those identified by security forces as protest leaders have been repeatedly detained and fined. At one recent pigeon-feeding session, burly men in uniforms grabbed a prominent opponent of the plant, Sergei Paterukhin, a former actor, while he was live-blogging the event, and bundled him into an unmarked car. It was the 10th time he had been arrested.
The Belarusian company behind the factory, 1AK-Group, denies any environmental risks, insisting that toxic lead waste will total just 6.6 pounds a year. Opponents of the plant dismiss this figure as impossibly low, but Richard Fuller, an environmental scientist and president of Pure Earth, a nonprofit organization based in New York, said that many lead-acid battery factories operated safely in Europe and the United States.
Mr. Fuller said he had not visited the Brest plant but added that, unlike low-cost artisanal operations, it seemed to have modern technology and safeguards capable of limiting toxic waste. âI canât imagine there would be any particular exposure,â he said.
The Brest battery factory had been scheduled to start production in early June, but in a concession to protesters, the authorities in Brest put it on hold while officials review whether it conforms to environmental standards.
The prosecutor generalâs office delivered an even bigger blow to the factory when it announced in early July that, on orders from President Lukashenko, it was investigating the battery plant project over corruption charges and that several senior executives had been detained.
Dmitri Bekalink, a critic of the factory and regular participant in the Sunday protests, said he had no problem with Chinese investment but complained that China had tied funding for the battery plant to contracts for a Chinese construction company, which served as general contractor, and a Chinese engineering company that provided the plantâs core manufacturing equipment.
âThey give with one hand but take back with the other,â Mr. Bekalink said.
Viktor Lemeshevsky, the chief of 1AK-Group, declined to be interviewed, and is now a target of the corruption investigation. He earlier told the Belarusian news media that he had asked the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other Western institutions for loans but was turned down. The European bank has no blanket ban on funding the manufacture of lead batteries but has extremely strict environmental and social impact rules.
China, Mr. Lemeshevsky said, raised no objections and provided funding through a $15 billion line of credit to Belarusâs Development Bank. This pool of credit is 20 times the total current loans to Belarus by the European bank.
Its finances squeezed by a cut in Russian energy subsidies, which will cost Belarus $300 million a year, the government in Minsk had hoped to get a loan from Moscow to fill a hole in its budget. It is now looking to China instead.
Polina Prysmakova, an assistant professor at Florida Atlantic University who has studied Beijingâs role in Belarus, her home country, said China was not seeking to push Belarus into a debt trap so as to grab assets, as happened in Sri Lanka, but simply trying to generate business for Chinese companies that have run out of things to build in China.
China, she said, is âoversaturated, with too many new towns, new roads, new power plants and new airports,â which means that âChinese companies need places like Belarus to keep building.â
Fueling this trend is Chinaâs so-called Belt and Road Initiative, a mammoth investment program that is the signature policy of the Chinese leader, President Xi Jinping. The initiative began in 2013 as a plan to develop land and maritime transport links between China and its foreign markets, but it has since mutated into a catchall cover for Chinese companies pushing for work abroad.
The force and scale of this push is on vivid display at Mr. Yarashenkaâs development zone, known as the Great Stone Industrial Park. Hailed recently by Mr. Xi as a âmodel projectâ of the Belt and Road Initiative, the park aims to turn an area twice the size of Manhattan into a city studded with factories, research centers and accommodation for the army of workers that will be needed to keep the place running.
The project, in which $440 million has already been invested, most of it from China, has provided construction work for the China CAMC Engineering Company, the 25th construction bureau of Chinaâs state railway corporation and a host of other Chinese firms. The first two Chinese companies to set up facilities in the park, said the administration head, were Huawei, the technology giant that Washington says poses a security risk, and ZTE, a Chinese tech company that was accused of violating United States sanctions against Iran and North Korea.
Bisected by two wide avenues â Peking Prospekt and Minsk Prospekt â the park so far seems more a ghost town than a thriving industrial hub. But China is studded with projects that initially seemed to defy economic logic but later grew into manufacturing powerhouses.
âWhen the Chinese set a goal, they move toward it steadily,â Mr. Yarashenka said, adding that Belarus should learn from this approach.
Just two years after the construction of the first building â a hotel and business center that remains mostly empty â the park has several working factories, an eight-story administration building and 25 miles of wide roads lined with lamp posts flying Chinese and Belarusian flags.
âThis was swamp and forest before. There was nothing here. Now we have this,â Mr. Yarashenka said, gesturing at a swirl of dump trucks and Chinese construction workers beneath his office window, the site of a technology research center funded with a grant from Beijing. âThis project shows that nothing is impossible.â

"Why Investors Need China in Their Portfolios; China represents more than 10% of the world's GDP, adjusted for purchasing power, but few investors have anywhere near a 10% China allocation.","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2010,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/817404631?accountid=14586,"Author: Burton G. Malkiel
One of the most common mistakes detracting from investment performance is the ""home country bias"" that afflicts both individual and institutional investors. Investors in the United States tend to limit their portfolios to U.S. stocks and bonds. Investors abroad do likewise.
As an investment strategy, that doesn't make sense. In our increasingly global economy, the U.S. has only about 20% of the world's GDP, and the developed economies as a group account for just over half of world economic activity. Moreover, the developing economies are growing much more rapidly than the developed ones. Inadequate international diversification seriously limits investor returns.
Neglect of China is a striking example of the lack of adequate diversification. For almost 30 years, the Chinese economy has been the fastest growing major economy in the world. Since the early 1980s, following the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping, it has expanded at more than a 9% rate of increase after inflation. China's economic performance is unprecedented--no country has ever grown so fast for such an extended period of time.
It is very likely that China will continue to grow rapidly for at least the next decade, if not longer. While the eastern part of China is now well developed, the vast central and western regions are still largely underdeveloped. There are 500 million unemployed or ""underemployed"" people living in those regions who are anxious to enjoy some of the riches that have been created in the east. They are mainly educated, motivated and often highly entrepreneurial. The Chinese government promotes growth in the region by developing new cities and investing in infrastructure such as power plants, roads and high-speed rail service. The Chinese growth miracle is only in the middle innings.
Rapid economic growth does not always create generous investment returns, however. Studies have found only a very weak relationship between real economic growth and equity returns. There have been periods in China's history where equity returns have been negative even while real economic growth continued rapidly. But poor periods for equities always followed periods of excessive common-stock valuations. Equity returns have corresponded to China's growth rate whenever initial valuation metrics were moderate at the start of the measurement period. Since Chinese equities today are reasonably priced, future economic growth is likely to be associated with generous future equity returns.
While China's growth should be sustainable, its composition is very likely to change. Thus far, it has relied largely on investment spending and increased exports. But China's high investment-to-GDP ratio is not sustainable, and the rest of the world, suffering from high unemployment, is unlikely to allow China to increase its exports at their historical rate. There is increasing international pressure on China to increase the value of its currency (the yuan or RMB). As China grapples with rising inflation, it is likely to see a revaluation of the yuan to be in its own domestic economic interest as well. Thus in the years ahead the yuan is very likely to increase in value relative to the U.S. dollar.
It should not be difficult to tilt China's economic activity away from investment and export spending and toward consumption. In the U.S., consumption expenditures have been about 70% of GDP over the past decade. Over the same period, China's consumption share is only 37%. As the Chinese become wealthier, they will demand more nondurable and durable goods.
With the encouragement of the government, China's automobile industry now produces more cars than America's. And the Chinese government has begun to build a social safety net (medical coverage, unemployment insurance and retirement plans) designed to reduce the need to save. Consumption expenditures have recently been growing much faster than overall GDP and are expected to continue to do so.
While a simple world index fund is a useful instrument for many investors, there are structural reasons that give China far too little weight in such a fund. Global indexes are ""float"" weighted, which means they only count shares that are publicly available, and China gets only a 2% weight in these indexes. All the so-called ""A"" Chinese shares that trade in Shanghai and Shenzhen are excluded from the float because they are not available to international investors. The Chinese government owns a significant share of the stock of many companies such as the banks and oil companies. Since government-owned shares do not trade freely they are also excluded from the float.
But China represents over 10% of the world's GDP, adjusted for purchasing power. Few investors have anywhere near a 10% allocation to China in their portfolios. I believe that most investors are seriously underweighted in Chinese equities and would be well served over time by increasing their allocations.
Chinese equities are attractively priced. Price-earnings multiples for Chinese stocks available to international investors in diversified exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are in the mid-teens, based on 2011 estimates. Moreover, so-called PEG ratios (the ratios of price-earnings multiples to estimated long-term growth rates) and other valuation indicators are extremely attractive.
In sum, economic growth translates into generous stock-market returns when valuations provide attractive entry levels as they do now. Over time, the Chinese currency is likely to continue to appreciate against the U.S. dollar, giving investors extra returns. Well diversified, relatively low-expense index funds that trade as ETFs should prove to be useful vehicles for individual investors to benefit from China's continued growth.

"China's New Foray Westward for Deals; China Development Bank to Work with Private Equity on Projects to 'Benefit, Promote China's Development'","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2011,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/908534276?accountid=14586,"BEIJING--China Development Bank Corp, which funded a wave of Chinese investment into Africa and the developing world, is teaming up with some of the West's biggest private-equity players in a new venture aimed at driving investment into and out of China.
Its newly formed CDB International Holdings Ltd. on Tuesday signed agreements with Permira, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and TPG to seek opportunities for co-investing. Parent company China Development Bank holds a small stake in TPG.
Zhang Xuguang, the chairman of Hong Kong-based CDB International, said in written answers to questions from the Wall Street Journal that it would concentrate on ""companies and projects that can benefit from and promote China's development.""
""The globalization of Chinese firms has been getting faster and its scale bigger, giving CDB International broad scope to develop,"" he said.
China Development Bank has pioneered China's loans-for-oil deals with Brazil and Africa, and helped Chinese construction companies win contracts around the developing world. But the focus of corporate China is now shifting to Western countries, an area where Chinese investment has typically been less welcome and where support from established private-equity players may be particularly useful.
Western private equity executives often complain that corporate bureaucracies and a cumbersome government approval process often slow Chinese state-backed firms to the point that they miss an opportunity to buy a company overseas. Having CDB as a partner could speed those deals.
The private-equity firms, meanwhile, could gain access to other deals in China through CDB's connections.
With Europe mired in a debt crisis and the U.S. economy still struggling, China--with $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves--is a potential source of funding for cash-strapped firms and governments. The U.K., for instance, is actively wooing Chinese investment in capital-intense infrastructure projects.
Although it is early days, Chinese firms seem increasingly interested in finding Western brands and technology that could sell well in China, such as high-end consumer goods as well as areas like logistics, which the government's five-year plan has targeted as a key industry.
China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp., tried a similar approach to CDB by taking stakes in Morgan Stanley and Blackstone Group LP. However, U.S. suspicions have lingered despite CIC's efforts to prove itself a good corporate citizen.
Kurt Bjorklund, Permira's co-managing partner, says Chinese investors are becoming more sophisticated.
""Chinese firms are learning how to address commercial and political sensitivities,"" he said. ""Also, on the receiving end, U.S. and European companies are operating in a more capital-scarce environment, and they're realizing Chinese firms are emerging as globally competitive alternatives with something to offer.""
Mr. Bjorklund said teaming up with CDB ""will provide us with access to deal flow in China that we would otherwise not see,"" and give its foreign portfolio companies better opportunities to expand in China. Permira puts a heavy focus on the companies in which it holds stakes developing their businesses in emerging markets like China.
Stephen Peel, managing partner and head of Asia for TPG, said CDB has played an important role in the overseas expansion of Chinese firms. ""The whole impetus for China to look at overseas acquisitions has accelerated over the last two to three years,"" he said. ""CDB is part of that. It's been a natural partner for companies looking to do something overseas.""
TPG has been in China for years and has yuan-denominated funds in Shanghai and Chongqing with which it can buy Chinese companies.
KKR, which also has been an active investor in China, declined to comment.

World News: Labor Shortage to Help China Adjust to Slowdown,"Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2012,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024896927?accountid=14586,"BEIJING -- Despite the sharpest economic slowdown in China since the global financial crisis, wages are still climbing rapidly and many companies are having trouble filling jobs -- evidence of a structural shortage in the labor market that may help China adjust to slower growth without threatening mass unemployment and political instability.
Reflecting the tight labor market, wage income for urban households rose 13% year-to-year in the first half, and average monthly income for migrant workers rose 14.9%, according to data from China's National Bureau of Statistics. A survey of 91 cities conducted in this year's first quarter by the labor ministry showed demand for workers outstripping supply by a record amount, pointing to low unemployment.
Jim Leininger, a Beijing manager at Towers Watson, a human resources consultancy, said preliminary data from a recent survey of hundreds of large Chinese and foreign employers in China suggested that their wages this year would rise a still-strong average of 8% year-over-year, compared with 10% in 2011.
The tight job situation, which contrasts with worrisome levels of unemployment in the U.S. and Europe, helps explain why Beijing isn't rushing to match the massive stimulus plan it put in place in 2009.
Back then, a crash in global trade forced large-scale layoffs in factories along the coast, and as many as 20 million migrant workers streamed home to inland villages, raising fears of social unrest that spurred the government to spend lavishly on high-speed rail, road and other projects to prop up growth and employment.
Thus far, the global slowdown isn't nearly as deep as it was in 2009 when the world economy skidded into recession. Sheng Laiyun, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said that around six million new jobs were created in China's cities in the first half of the year, and employment numbers for migrant workers also crept up.
Domestic shifts are also working in China's favor. The size of the work force has plateaued, demographers say, and will start to shrink in the middle of the decade, intensifying competition for workers.
China is committed to sharply raising minimum wages, which puts pressure on employers to raise salaries for higher skilled workers. Beijing also has increased requirements for severance payments, which discourages layoffs unless business drops severely.
In addition, China is eventually planning to retool its economy so it is less reliant on heavy industry like steel mills and cement kilns -- which generate a lot of output with few workers. The government wants the service sector, which employs more workers per unit of output, to play a bigger part in driving growth.
In the past, breakneck growth -- with increases in gross domestic product averaging around 10% a year for the past 30 years -- was necessary to create jobs for the millions of young workers flooding into China's job market each year. Now that flood is drying up, just as China looks to focus more on job-intensive service-sector growth.
That dynamic helps explain why there have been few reports of layoffs, even though growth in China's GDP has almost halved from a peak of 14.8% in the second quarter of 2007, to 7.6% in the second quarter of 2012. It also explains why China's leaders appear more sanguine about slowing growth. ""China's potential growth rate has fallen,"" said Chen Dongqi, a senior government researcher, adding that ""7% to 8% is the new normal.""
Rising wages also bring risks, however. In China, wages are starting from a very low base, but they are climbing fast. At current rates, China's private-sector manufacturing wages will double from their 2011 levels by 2015, and triple by 2017, eroding competitiveness and denting the exports that have played a key part in China's early growth. Indeed, Boston Consulting Group calculates that China's wages could rise above Mexico's this year when factoring in differences in productivity between the two nations.
The transition to a higher-wage economy, with a bigger role for service-sector output and domestic consumption, won't be straightforward. Tough policy decisions, including opening key parts of the service sector -- like banking and telecoms -- to greater competition, have yet to be taken. Some of those decisions require cutting against powerful interest groups like state-owned enterprises and local government. The process will play out in years, not months.
The results will have consequences for who wins and loses from China's rapidly changing economy. The same increases in wages that start to price China's products out of global markets should also lift China's demand for imports of consumer goods. The main beneficiaries of China's rapid growth so far have been commodity exporters like iron ore-rich Australia and manufacturers of advanced machinery like Germany. In the future, producers of high-end consumer goods in the U.S. and Europe could start to enjoy more of the benefits.
China's official unemployment rate was 4.1% at the end of the first quarter, though the data cover only urban workers and are widely regarded as unreliable. The U.S. unemployment rate was 8.2% in June, and wages rose just 1.7% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with a year earlier. In the euro area, unemployment hit a euro-era high of 11.1% in May.
Some of China's largest private employers report rising wages and hiring. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which produces Apple's iPad, added 82,000 to its mainland China work force in 2011, taking the total to 998,599. Base salaries for factory workers at the company's Shenzhen plant were 2,200 yuan a month as of February this year, up 10% from 2011, said the company.
Even small export companies -- among the hardest hit by the downturn -- are seeing wages continue to climb. Zhang Qikang, a senior manager at ceramics-maker Foshan Monalisa Industry Co. in the southern city of Foshan, says that average wages for workers at the company are now 2,800 yuan a month, having risen 20% in both 2011 and 2012.
Factories are being forced to invest more in labor-saving technology as wages rise, underlining the impact of the labor shortage. ""The days of just adding people are over,"" said Dwight Nordstrom, president of Pacific Resources International in Beijing, which operates 10 factories in China. Rising wages are changing the type of worker Mr. Nordstrom looks to employ. ""We're looking for more skilled workers who can handle machines,"" rather than adding unskilled labor, he said.
Underpinning resilience in China's labor markets are profound demographic changes. China's one-child policy, introduced in 1980, is starting to eat into the labor supply. In 2005, there were 120.7 million Chinese people aged 15-19, according to estimates from the United Nations. By 2010, that had fallen to 105.3 million, and by 2015 it is expected to drop to 94.9 million.
The number of farm workers ready to head to city factories is no longer growing rapidly. A survey of migrant workers conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed the number relatively stable at 252.8 million in 2011, up 4.4% from 242.2 million in 2010, with the number working outside their home province growing even more slowly.

Noda Warns China on Islands Spat,"Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2012,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1068478554?accountid=14586,"Â  TOKYO -- Japan's prime minister warned China that its inflammatory reaction to a territorial dispute -- from violent protests to apparent informal trade sanctions -- could further weaken China's already-fragile economy by scaring away foreign investors. The comments showed the risks that the diplomatic standoff could broaden into a damaging commercial tit-for-tat between the world's second- and third-largest economies.
""China should be developing through the various foreign investments it receives,"" Yoshihiko Noda told The Wall Street Journal following a tense week filled with news of Japanese factories torched and cars overturned, and Chinese patrol boats hovering in and around territorial waters controlled by Japan. ""I hope for its levelheaded and rational understanding that anything to discourage that is a disservice to itself,"" the prime minister added during the interview in his residence Saturday.
""Recent delays in customs and visa issuance are of concern,"" Mr. Noda continued, referring to reports that Japanese companies were now facing a form of economic harassment, as he offered his most detailed comments to date on the business implications of the row. ""Damaging our ties over such things would be bad for not just the two countries' economies, but for the global economy,"" he added.
Japan is simultaneously ensnared in an increasingly bitter tiff with another neighbor, South Korea, both over a separate territorial argument, as well as a debate over whether Japan has made adequate amends for its World War II aggression. Mr. Noda made clear in the interview that his government had no intention of making the concessions Seoul has demanded as necessary for repairing diplomatic ties frayed in recent months, indicating an extended period of friction there as well.
Asked whether he would consider providing new compensation for the so-called comfort women who served as sex slaves for the Japanese soldiers, Mr. Noda said firmly: ""The matter is closed."" He said South Korean criticism that Japan's previous offerings were insufficient ""hurt the feelings of conscientious Japanese, and it is a pity.""
Mr. Noda conducted the interview in advance of a visit to the United Nations General Assembly session starting Monday, where he plans to give a speech highlighting the importance of ""the rule of law"" in international dispute settlement. While aides said that is intended as an allusion to Japan's tiffs with its neighbors, Mr. Noda said he wouldn't single out any countries by name: ""I don't think it's appropriate for a leader to go on in length and in detail about individual issues.""
Indeed, at the same time that Japan appears to be taking a firm line in its regional disputes, officials are also looking for ways to dial down the heat, particularly with China. Illustrating his balancing act, Mr. Noda held out hope that the recent curbing of formal diplomatic contacts would be eased, and that the foreign ministers of the two nations would meet in New York as a step toward defusing tensions over the contested islets in the East China Sea. ""If there is a chance, we should hold such a meeting,"" he said.
But Beijing indicated Sunday that it wasn't ready to move on, with the official Xinhua news agency reporting that the Chinese government had decided to cancel various ceremonies scheduled for later this week related to the 40th anniversary of normalization of postwar diplomatic ties between the two nations.
The latest flare-up with China followed the Japanese government's purchase from private Japanese owners earlier this month of the islands controlled by Japan but also claimed by China. Japan's nationalization of the islands -- known as the Senkaku in Japan, Diaoyu in China -- set off anti-Japanese demonstrations in more than 100 cities in China, some violent, leaving a trail of burned-down factories, looted stores and vandalized consulates. The head of a Japanese insurers' industry body has said insurance payments to Japanese companies damaged by the protests could total up to tens of billions of yen.
Beijing also sent paramilitary patrol boats under its various agencies to waters near the islands, setting off a cat-and-mouse chase with the Japanese Coast Guard that has continued for more than a week. Japanese opposition lawmakers have called for beefing up the defenses around the islands. But Mr. Noda said he saw no need to bring in the Japanese navy, and shrugged off the possibility of a military conflict. ""It's not good to talk about pessimistic scenarios,"" the 55-year-old leader said.
Mr. Noda also gave Chinese officials some credit for trying to calm things down, saying ""the government itself is calling for restraint, and I believe it is trying to defuse such behavior and actions,"" he said, referring to the protests. ""However, I don't think they've been entirely successful yet,"" he added.
He also noted that while the violence had died down, he cited the new trade delays as evidence that prospects remain for spreading economic fallout. In recent days, Japanese companies have reported customs-clearing delays, raising concerns that China was now retaliating economically, just as it did after a similar territorial spat in 2010 led to a curb on the export to Japan of rare-earth minerals vital for the production of some of Japan's leading products such as hybrid cars.
Mr. Noda implied that other countries would conclude they are vulnerable to the same kind of harassment facing the Japanese -- and possibly curb investments -- making a point of citing the incident in Beijing on Tuesday where anti-Japanese protesters briefly surrounded the American ambassador's car, causing minor damage. ""Even the U.S. embassy and its official car came under attack,"" Mr. Noda said.
Mr. Noda's remarks Saturday followed statements by Japanese business leaders that they may begin to rethink their ties to China. Tokyo has considerable economic clout: Japan has become a major contributor to China's growth, just as China has become economically vital to Japan. Japanese companies injected $12 billion in foreign direct investment into China last year, according to Japanese government statistics. Japan is China's second largest trading partner, while China is Japan's largest. In addition to the isles dispute with China, Japan faces another with South Korea, which has evolved into an issue over Japan's wartime compensation. The South Korean foreign minister is widely expected to raise demands for new ""comfort women"" compensation in his U.N. speech.
The long-simmering issue has heated up over the past year, after the South Korean constitutional court ruled that the country's leaders had violated the law by failing to negotiate a new compensation package with Japan. That put new pressure on South Korea's leaders, and Seoul has since twice asked Tokyo to hold consultations, but the requests were turned down.
While more understated than the rhetoric coming out of China, Mr. Noda's comments over the weekend echoed remarks by Chinese government officials and editorials suggesting that tensions could spill into business ties. The China Daily, for example, carried a column titled ""Consider Sanctions on Japan."" ""Japan's economy will suffer severely if China were to impose sanctions on it. China's loss would be relatively less,"" said the piece written by an analyst at a think tank affiliated with China's Ministry of Commerce.
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak cited the lack of progress on the issue as a reason for the recent flare-up in their bilateral territorial rivalry over a group of tiny islets known as the Liancourt Rocks, including his surprise August visit to the area called Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan. After that, South Korea's National Assembly passed a resolution demanding more formal apologies and compensation from the Japanese government over the comfort women issue.
In contrast to his remarks about China, which appeared to leave the door open for discussions, Mr. Noda was resolute Saturday in refusing Seoul's demand for government compensation, saying that South Korea agreed to forfeit claims to wartime compensation when the two nations normalized ties in 1965.
""In the long negotiation process, we have completely and legally resolved the matter of compensation,"" Mr. Noda said. He said the government went out of its way to jointly set up a fund in 1995 with private donations to provide the former comfort women with compensation. South Korea has said the fund should come directly from Japan's government. Mr. Noda said Korea should first revise its assessment of the fund that Japan has already offered before the two sides can look into alternatives.
Facing some criticism at home that Japan hasn't done enough to explain globally its side of its disputes with South Korea, Mr. Noda said: ""We've been conducting backstage negotiations on the matter. We need to advertise this fact to the international community.""

Apple's iPhone 5 Nears Debut on Chinese Market,"Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2012,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1220767727?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING -- Apple Inc.'s iPhone 5 is likely to go on sale in China in the coming weeks, after a government website indicated that the popular smartphone received regulatory approval.
The imminent availability of the phone was good news for Apple, which has seen its status slip as the overwhelming leader in China for high-end phones. Smartphone makers such Samsung Electronics Co. have gained popularity offering phones with larger screens that run Google Inc.'s Android software. Analysts in part have blamed the slide on the wait for Apple's newest offering, which was introduced in the U.S. and other markets in September.
China's Telecommunication Equipment Certification Center on Thursday said in two entries on its website that it had approved an Apple phone for a network-access license. The center posted a photo of what appeared to be the iPhone 5, which is distinguishable by its long screen. The phone is compatible with the network standard supported by China's second and third-largest mobile carriers, China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. and China Telecom Corp., the regulator said. The iPhone isn't offered by China's largest carrier, China Mobile Ltd.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
Vendors in China often start selling new handsets within weeks of approval by the regulator, and China Telecom Chairman Wang Xiaochu said recently that the company hoped to begin offering the phone by early December.
Apple's previous iPhone, the 4S, initially was a hit in China. Its release in the country in January prompted jostling outside an Apple store in Beijing among would-be buyers. But some customers in China grumbled that the phone wasn't all that different from the previous model, iPhone 4.
Sales for the new phone nevertheless are likely to be brisk as Apple's iPhones, iPads and Macs have become status symbols for China's growing middle class. Apple's China sales were $5.7 billion in the fiscal quarter through September, roughly 16% of the company's global total. Chief Executive Tim Cook said in October that China continued to be a strong area of growth.
Despite Apple's success in China, it has been in close competition at the high end of the market with Android-based smartphones. Phones running Android mobile software claimed 56% of the market for phones priced above 3,000 yuan ($480) in the third quarter, while Apple had 42%, according to research firm Analysys International. Android phones accounted for 2.8 million handsets, while iPhones totaled 2.1 million.
Even if Apple concedes market share at the top of the phone market, the Cupertino, Calif., company likely will continue to reap significant earnings from China. Analysys predicts that smartphone sales will reach 130 million units this year and 165 million next year, up from 81 million units in 2011, leaving competitors plenty of room for growth.
The iPhone generally carries a retail price above 4,000 yuan in China, more than most rivals, and has a significant profit margin. Phones in China aren't subsidized by carriers to the same degree as they are in the U.S., and consumers often are willing to pay $500 or more for the privilege of having the latest device.
The iPhone 5 was introduced in September in countries including Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong but not in China. Apple has said it expected the new smartphone to be available in 100 countries by year-end.
Analysts said the China delay partly was because of Apple's need to meet demand in the U.S. market and for the country-specific tests and licensing necessary in China. China Unicom was the only official carrier in the country to offer the iPhone until March, when China Telecom began selling the phone.

"For Apple, China Offers Bright Spot As Earnings Idle","Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2013,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1272383969?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING -- China gave Apple Inc. some cheer in an otherwise disappointing earnings report, as newly broken-out results showed the gadget maker benefited from efforts to broaden distribution and increase its focus on what has become the company's No. 2 market.
On Wednesday the Cupertino, Calif., maker of iPhones and iPads for the first time provided sales data for its Greater China region, showing a 67% increase from a year earlier in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 29. Apple's China sales were larger than its sales in Japan, as well as larger than in the rest of Asia.
The figures include only a few weeks of sales of Apple's new iPhone 5, which wasn't released in mainland China until mid-December. The China sales include Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Apple's performance underscores the heft it has won in China, as well as the stakes in the increasingly competitive market. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 29, Apple posted revenue of $22.5 billion in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, nearly double the amount from the prior year.
By comparison, Lenovo Group Ltd., China's national champion in consumer electronics, posted $29.57 billion in global sales in the year ended March 31.
The results show the growing influence of increasingly wealthy Chinese consumers who come out by the millions to buy new handsets. During Wednesday's earnings call, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company would continue to expand its retail channels in China and pointed out the speed with which the company brought the iPhone 5 to market in China.
Mr. Cook said Apple increased the number of places where consumers could buy iPhones to more than 17,000 from 7,000 in the fiscal first quarter a year earlier.
""Now this isn't nearly what we need, and it's not the final by any means,"" he said. ""We are not even close to that. But we are making. . .great progress.""
Referring to a trip to China earlier this month, he said, ""I was just over there recently and talking to a lot of different people, and I am very happy with how things are going.""
The report of the sales boost comes as Apple faces intense competition from Samsung Electronics Co. and other phone makers using Google Inc.'s Android mobile-operating software, who are offering bigger phones with increasingly powerful innards.
Apple's market share dropped to 4.2% of the China smartphone market in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from a 5.8% market share in the same period a year earlier, according to research group Analysys International.
But Apple continues to maintain 42% of the market for the highly profitable smartphones that sell for more than 3,000 yuan ($480), according to Analysys International. The basic iPhone 5, with 16 gigabytes of memory, sells for 5,288 yuan in China.
Despite the rapid rise of China's smartphone market, analysts say there is still significant room to grow. During Apple's earnings call, Mr. Cook said iPhone sales more than doubled year to year in Greater China. Apple recently opened three new stores in mainland China, bringing the total to eight.
Though the company has begun to broaden its limited retail channels in China, another distribution bottleneck remains for the company in the form of China's largest mobile carrier, China Mobile Ltd. Apple still doesn't sell the iPhone through China Mobile, which had 87.9 million subscribers to higher-cost, third-generation mobile services at the end of 2012. Subscribers to 3G service tend to be the most likely to buy premium smartphones.
Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met with China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier might soon start offering the iPhone.
Many analysts have questioned Apple's decision thus far not to sell a more modestly priced smartphone, arguing that the company is missing out on a rapidly swelling segment that would make up for lower margins with massive sales. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was working on a lower-end iPhone that could be available later this year.

By Timothy Beardson
(Yale, 517 pages, GBP 25)
Outside of world wars and market cataclysms, the relative trajectories of major powers usually trace gradual curves rather than abruptly rising or falling. After the 2008 financial crisis, however, commentators in China and to a lesser extent in the West suggested that the U.S. had hit an inflection point. China, they said, was zooming toward parity as a world power, and perhaps more.
In recent months, for somewhat less obvious reasons including Beijing's increasing pushiness in East Asia and the country's just-completed once-a-decade leadership transition, this conversation has been shifting again, at least in the West. America's relative decline is anything but assured, many analysts have begun to proclaim, with some adding that China's rise to global pre-eminence any time soon is highly unlikely.
Timothy Beardson's sprawling ""Stumbling Giant: The Threats to China's Future"" joins a far-ranging group of books making the latter case. Edward Luttwak, in his 2012 book, ""The Rise of China vs. the Logic of Strategy,"" for example, argues that what he calls China's ""all-round military aggrandizement,"" coupled with the country's very fast economic growth, is essentially self-canceling. If China continues along this path, with double-digit increases of military expenditures and ever more assertive behavior, the result will not be a stronger China but rather a country increasingly countered by balancing neighbors and more distant powers.
In his recent ""China Goes Global: The Partial Power,"" David Shambaugh, one of America's foremost scholars of Chinese affairs, performed perhaps the most comprehensive examination of China's strengths and weaknesses, concluding that ""the elements of China's global power are actually surprisingly weak and very uneven"" and that ""China is not as important, and it is certainly not as influential, as conventional wisdom holds.""
In ""Stumbling Giant,"" Mr. Beardson, a banker with long experience in East Asia, argues that a combination of terrible demographics and conservative, reform-averse leadership makes it unlikely that China will ever attain world leadership or superpower status.
By 2030, China will have more people over the age of 65 than the U.S. has people, and its working-age population is already beginning what will be a steep and hard-to-manage decline. When the U.S., Japan and South Korea attained levels of aging similar to China's today, Mr. Beardson writes, ""they each had a per capita GDP of around $15,000; the figure for China in 2011 was about $4,300.""
The actuarial implications of this are staggering. China stands to become the first aspiring global power that becomes old before it can become rich. As citizens of Japan, Northern Europe and, increasingly, the U.S. well know, it is hard for even high-income countries to meet the health and retirement burdens of the elderly.
This task will be vastly more difficult, Mr. Beardson argues, for China, a country with a meager social safety net. In a couple of decades, it will have hundreds of millions of citizens with expensive chronic diseases and perhaps 150 million people in need of institutional care.
""China has a limited window of opportunity -- maybe twenty years -- to make its economic breakthrough. Otherwise it risks being caught in a 'middle income' trap,"" Mr. Beardson writes in the introduction. Toward the end, he writes that ""China can continue to rise but the threats [it faces are] so serious and so widespread, and the domestic policy response so timid, that it is inconceivable that China will overtake the United States this century.""
These are reasonable, if debatable, observations, however lacking in originality or particular insight. But most of the book is a woolly compendium of bric-a-brac gleaned from research, years of reading and plentiful surmise. Mr. Beardson's book aims to be even more comprehensive than Mr. Shambaugh's, though he brings none of the discipline of a scholar to his task. ""Stumbling Giant"" has the encyclopedic feel of something from a bygone century, when isolated thinkers committed everything they had learned about the universe to a single book.
Mr. Beardson holds forth on subjects as varied as land tenure, education, dynastic history and science. Sometimes the results are provocatively interesting, such as his claim that the emergence of large international concessions in cities like Shanghai and Tianjin in the late 19th century -- an aspect of what China speaks of today as a ""century of humiliation"" -- ""constituted the largest cultural transfer in human history,"" with Western traders and industrialists providing invaluable knowhow in industry and finance. That China suffered humiliation is undeniable, but this claim is a refreshing counterpoint to the manipulatively nationalistic way in which the history of this era is taught in China.
Much more often, one is left bewildered or simply numbed. At one point, Mr. Beardson writes that China ""has never been at the center of world affairs."" For most of world history, no country was, but for centuries China, the center of gravity for much of Asia, came as close to meeting this standard as any. Sub-chapters, meanwhile, often begin with banal observations like ""There are many different views of the years from 1949 until Mao's death in 1976"" and ""There is a potential in China for further major change in Party, state and nation.""
Worse, though, is the pretense of expertise in virtually everything as the author rambles from subject to subject. This has the perverse effect of robbing any particular argument of authority. ""This is not an encyclopedia of modern Chinese civilization,"" Mr. Beardson writes. ""It does not celebrate all the many achievements of China in science and medicine, contemporary art, commerce, cuisine, sport or space."" Amid the huge catalog of topics glancingly touched upon, it's a wonder that he left these out.

Ding Xuedong, a deputy secretary-general of China's cabinet, the State Council, is likely to become chairman of China Investment Corp., the people said. He would succeed Lou Jiwei, who left CIC early this year to head the country's Ministry of Finance.
Mr. Ding's appointment is expected to be announced in the coming days, the people said, though China's political system is opaque and changes can be made at the last minute.
The move would mark the latest reshuffle of key government and corporate posts as part of the current once-in-a-decade leadership transition.
Ranked as the fifth-largest sovereign fund in the world, CIC was formed in 2007 to help diversify China's vast foreign-exchange stockpile from low-yielding U.S. Treasury bonds. As of the end of last year, the fund had nearly $500 billion of assets under management.
Mr. Ding, 53 years old, had served as China's vice finance minister before being named as a deputy secretary-general of the State Council.

China's Muscle-Flexing and Asian Regional Harmony; China's muscle-flexing in the South China Sea doesn't fit well with its declarations of peaceful intent.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2013,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1466662988?accountid=14586,"Â  John Bolton (""How to Answer China's Muscle-Flexing,"" op-ed, Dec. 5) calls the ""peaceful rise"" of China a fantasy, citing its expanding military budget as evidence for another more plausible theory, at least in his mind--a menacing rise to power. However, he misses the intensely human element in his analysis. It might benefit us all to remember an old German proverb from a century ago, ""Speak loudly and brandish a big gun."" Berlin neither wanted a war at first, nor to set up a German hegemony, but instead desired to sit at her rightful place among the European powers--to be heard as anyone else. Regarding the defense zone, Xi Jinping said he wanted to ""treat neighbors with friendship and as partners,"" with a strong blue-water navy as a necessary means to this end. These were precisely the aims of Germany in the early 20th century.
If Berlin's neighbors wouldn't behold her legitimacy with appropriate respect, then she would scare them into recognizing it, or in the words of Friedrich von Bernhardi, Europe would give Germany ""that high esteem which is due them . . . and has hitherto been withheld from them."" Interestingly, Mr. Bolton proposes containing China with ""something akin to an alliance system,"" a strategy that ironically unraveled and doomed Europe. Wouldn't China cry einkreisung (encirclement), just as the Germans did, and accelerate its military plans with yet greater vigor, bearing us down the path of pre-World War I Europe to even darker tragedy?
Preston J. Juarez

Mr. Bolton's detailed analysis offers some much-needed perspective on the attempt to cure China's muscle-flexing. Furthermore, there is ground for optimism about easing the tension over the East China Sea. First of all, the U.S. should acknowledge that Japan, China and Taiwan dispute the islands' sovereignty. The Obama administration must seek to reduce tensions arising by a return to its stance that ""we do not hold any position on the sovereignty of the disputed Diaoyutai Islands.""
Next, with the risk of an incident rapidly increasing, China and Japan should pause a moment to consider the East China Sea peace initiative, in which Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou urges all parties to replace confrontation with dialogue, shelve territorial disputes through negotiations, formulate a code of conduct and engage in joint development of resources. The initiative provides a viable empirical model for peaceful resolution of regional disputes, especially in light of Beijing's recent decision to establish an East China Sea air-defense identification zone.

Production Starts at China's First Deep Water Natural Gas Field; Marks Milestone in China's Efforts to Exploit Energy Reserves Deep Under the South China Sea,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1511366659?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG--China's first deep water natural gas field has started producing gas, marking a milestone in China's efforts both to exploit energy reserves deep under the South China Sea and to increase use of the cleaner-burning fuel.
The US$6.5 billion Liwan-3 project, operated and 49% owned by Canada-listed Husky Energy Inc., is in undisputed Chinese waters about 325 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong. Beijing wants to increase gas use to around 10% of China's energy mix by 2020 from less than 5% now as part of a push to wean the country off coal, which supplies around two-thirds of its fuel and produces huge amounts of pollution and greenhouse gases.
""Liwan is Husky's largest project to date and places us inside the door of one of the fastest-growing energy markets in the world,"" said Chief Executive Asim Ghosh, in a news release issued here Monday to mark the first gas flow. ""It was a massive undertaking and is a great achievement for deep water gas production in the Asia-Pacific Region.""
Initial natural gas sales from the field, majority owned by China's Cnooc Ltd., are expected to be approximately 250 million cubic feet a day, increasing to approximately 300 mmcf a day in the second half of 2014, Husky said. Husky is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.
Sales of condensates and natural gas liquids are expected to be approximately 10,000 to 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, it said.
The gas comes from wells drilled into the seabed beneath 1,450 meters of water, which is piped ashore to a terminal west of Hong Kong owned by Cnooc, from where it will be delivered to customers in Southern China. Additional gas, from the nearby Liuhua 34-2 field will start flowing ashore in the second half of 2014. At peak, the Liwan pipeline will handle up to 500 mmcf a day of gas, Husky said.
China also is trying to meet ballooning demand using overland pipelines and tankers. Last year, China National Petroleum Corp. started piping gas offshore Myanmar into southwestern China, and the company is trying to clinch a deal with Russia to build a gas pipeline from eastern Siberia to the north of the country.
The country's seaborne liquefied natural gas imports, mostly from Qatar and Australia, rose 22% last year. Chinese companies also have long-range plans to import LNG from Russia, North America and Mozambique.

"China's Big Airlines Get Boost From Overseas Travel; Despite Foreign Exchange Losses, Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern Airlines Post Core Earnings Growth","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1519623796?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG--Growth in overseas leisure travel has helped boost core earnings at China's biggest airlines in the first quarter, and signaled that the nation's recent slowdown hasn't weighed on consumer sentiment as much as some may have feared.
Chinese airlines carried 13% more passengers in the first three months of 2014 from a year earlier, though they saw demand being particularly strong to points outside mainland China. At flag carrier Air China Ltd., international passenger revenue rose 19% during the period, slightly below the 22% jump at rival China Southern Airlines Co.
An increasingly congested home market has prompted the nation's state carriers to expand their overseas reach, launching new long-haul routes from smaller cities such as Changsha and Chengdu to destinations in Europe and North America.
But the move also mirrors the consistent growth in the number of Chinese leisure travelers seeking to go abroad, despite China's economic expansion slowing to 7.4% in the first quarter, its lowest level in 18 months as the world's second-largest economy continued to downshift.
""Slower economic growth won't have immediate impact on leisure air traffic unless there are one-off factors such as a major economic crisis or natural disasters that significantly disrupt air travel sentiment,"" said Kelvin Lau, a transport analyst at Daiwa Securities, noting he expects demand for leisure travel to remain resilient.
During the first quarter, the number of Chinese air passengers traveling abroad rose 17% from a year earlier, according to the nation's aviation regulator, reaching 7.1 million people and accounted for nearly 8% of all airline passengers.
Nonetheless, net earnings figures released this week showed that China's 'Big Three' state carriers reported significantly weaker first-quarter results because of a weaker national currency, which fell 2.7% during the period against the U.S. dollar.
The Big Three--Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern Airlines Corp.--have as much as 80% of their net debt denominated in U.S. dollars to finance aircraft leases and purchases, and any fluctuations in the yuan would have a major impact on their bottom lines. The weaker yuan has also hurt corporate profits among other Chinese industries, such as oil refiners, because crude oil is denominated in U.S. dollars.
Air China on Tuesday said its first-quarter net profit plummeted 63% to 92.7 million yuan ($15 million), compared with 249 million yuan in the year-earlier period. Meanwhile, China Southern and China Eastern posted a combined net loss of 511 million yuan during the period.
Yet these foreign-exchange losses are mostly noncash, as companies are required under accounting rules to value their substantial foreign-currency debts at the end of every quarter.
Consequently, they don't pose significant medium-term impact if the yuan's declines stabilizes near current levels, say analysts.
The weak net results therefore mask the robust earnings pickup in the nation's airline industry for the quarter. All the Big Three carriers would have been profitable on an operating level if the currency impact was excluded.
At China Southern, for example, operating profit saw a near fivefold increase to 1.07 billion yuan, from 188 million yuan in the same period last year, according to Barclays Capital estimates. With the currency impact, the airline swung to a net loss. Similarly, at Air China, first-quarter operating profit increased by 515 million yuan excluding the foreign exchange items.
The overseas expansion drive by the Chinese airlines is helping improve utilization of the many widebody aircraft the carriers have ordered over recent years. Most aircraft orders by the state airlines are done through a centralized procurement agency by the government, and in the past have led to mismatches between capacity and demand.
However, analysts say they expect some of the new international routes to remain unprofitable in the near term or manage to break even at best.
The Chinese airlines are ""going into this faster growing segment to broaden their earnings stream, but in the medium term these new businesses won't necessarily be very profitable to them because of the startup costs attached with the network expansion,"" said Andrew Orchard, an aviation analyst at CIMB Securities
The outlook for the Big Three carriers will also be overshadowed by the government's recent efforts to liberalize the nation's skies. The government earlier this year unveiled long-awaited guidelines to jump-start the nation's fledgling budget-airline market, including pledges of financial support, plans to simplify approvals for new low-cost airlines, as well as measures to help existing budget carriers expand their fleets more quickly.
Mr. Orchard said he estimates nonstate airlines, including budget carriers, account for around a quarter of seat capacity on routes that they compete head-to-head with state carriers. He expects these private airlines to play an even bigger role in the domestic travel market going forward.
""The history of low-cost carriers is that they've been price eroding so it's logical to assume that there'll be some ticket price impact,"" he said.

China's World: China Is Paying a Price For Aggressive Actions,"Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1524047553?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING -- As China's assertiveness mounts, nothing seems to illustrate the impotence of Southeast Asian nations more than their glacial progress toward a code of conduct with Beijing on the South China Sea.
It's been a marathon effort -- and there's no end in sight: China has made it explicitly clear it's in no hurry to move ahead. But it would be misguided to think Beijing is shrugging off the push entirely.
The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, has been imploring China for a code of conduct to head off exactly the sort of action that's now roiling one of the most flourishing areas of the global economy -- Beijing's decision to tow a gigantic oil drilling rig into disputed waters off Vietnam, protected by military aircraft and a flotilla of ships.
Over the weekend, Asean leaders once again pleaded for speedy action on a code of conduct after a meeting in Myanmar that was overshadowed by the crisis. Washington, too, is pressing hard for it.
Yet, almost two decades after diplomatic efforts to reach an agreement got under way, formal discussions between China and Asean to work out the details have only just begun.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last year chided unnamed countries who he said wanted a ""quick fix"" agreement. Such an approach, he said, is ""neither realistic nor serious.""
Meantime, as diplomacy drags on, China has been rapidly building up its military capabilities, particularly its navy, and using its muscle to alter the landscape in its own backyard. In 2012, Chinese ships fenced off the Scarborough Shoal, one of the world's richest fishing grounds just off the Philippines coast.
Positioning an oil rig off Vietnam is an unprecedented move by China to press its natural resources claims in the South China Sea. Vietnam accuses Chinese vessels of repeatedly ramming its ships and opening up on them with water cannon. A Chinese foreign ministry official on Monday described the positioning of the rig as merely a ""continuation of our regular activity"" in the area.
Many Western analysts believe that the timing of Beijing's aggressive rig maneuver, bracketed between a visit to the region by U.S. President Barack Obama and the Asean meeting in Myanmar, was designed to send a message: to the U.S., that China intends to test its resolve to ""pivot"" to Asia in support of its friends and allies who feel bullied by China; to Asean, that China means to enforce its claims over almost the entire South China Sea through unilateral action.
If that's the case, then what's the point of pushing for a code of conduct?
Why would Beijing ever agree to be tied down by arrangements that Asean has put forward to help keep the peace? Among them: full respect for the United Nations Law of the Sea, self-restraint and nonuse of force to resolve disputes.
The choice now facing the U.S. and its Asian allies is often presented in stark terms: either back down or confront China with military force.
Yet that perspective may be overly simplistic. For a start, China has been careful to calibrate its actions so that they fall just below the threshold that might trigger an armed response. China is many years away from being able to stand up militarily to the U.S. -- and the presence of U.S. forces in the region is still a powerful deterrent.
But also, it overlooks the pressures that are building on Beijing to find compromise solutions based on international rules and norms.
Already, the Philippines has launched a legal challenge at a U.N. arbitration tribunal to China's sovereignty claims over the entire South China Sea. China has so far ignored the action, but Manila calculates -- with reason -- that China's failure to participate will come at a considerable cost to its international reputation, particularly if it wins a favorable ruling.
And the damage to Beijing's international standing could increase if other Asian countries take similar legal action, as seems likely over time.
China has no wish to be branded an international outlaw: It has devoted huge amounts of energy over the years into integrating itself into global rules-based institutions, even if its ultimate intention is to change them to its advantage from the inside.
Moreover, China's assertiveness is driving Southeast Asian countries into America's arms. Several are forging closer relations with Japan, China's arch-rival in the region. And, say military analysts, the prospect that new regional groupings may coalesce to counter Chinese power may also act to restrain Chinese behavior.
To be sure, attitudes toward China within Asean over the South China Sea are divided between countries like the Philippines and Vietnam, which favor a tougher line, and those like Thailand and Singapore, which have no direct maritime dispute with China. Cambodia, a close ally of China, has sided with Beijing in previous discussions on the disputes. This ambiguity was reflected in a statement issued by Asean foreign ministers on Saturday that expressed ""serious concerns"" over the clashes in the South China Sea -- but without mentioning China by name.
Still, the fact that Asean was galvanized to come out with a statement at all underscores that Beijing pays a certain price for its aggressive actions. And that price rises the longer that discussions on a code of conduct limp on.

"White House Says China's Oil-Rig Deployment 'Provocative,' Dangerous; U.S. Hasn't Taken a Position on China's and Vietnam's Competing Sovereignty Claims in South China Sea","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1524989454?accountid=14586,"Â  WASHINGTON--The White House on Friday stepped up criticism of China's deployment of an oil rig in the South China Sea, saying the move had complicated relations in the region and made peaceful resolution of territorial disputes more difficult.
""This is a provocative act, and it raises tensions in the region,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
China and Vietnam are locked in a dispute over contested waters that both claim as part of their territory. The standoff, which escalated after a state-run Chinese oil company positioned an oil rig in the area, has sparked riots in Vietnam and raised fears of a military conflict.
The U.S. hasn't taken a position on the nations' competing sovereignty claims in the region, Mr. Carney said, but said no country should resort to intimidation and threats.
""We're very concerned about dangerous conduct and intimidation by government-controlled assets operating in this area, and we call on all parties to conduct themselves in a safe and professional manner to preserve freedom of navigation and overflight, to exercise restraint, to take steps to lower tensions and to address competing sovereignty claims peacefully and in accordance with international law,"" Mr. Carney said.

"Cathay Pacific, Air China, to Inject $321.4 Million into Cargo Joint Venture; Funds to Help Air China Cargo Develop its Cargo Charter Flight Business with China Postal Airlines","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1540288960?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG--Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Air China Ltd. have agreed to inject a combined 2 billion yuan ($321.4 million) into their air cargo joint venture, as the freight operator reels under weak demand and high fuel prices.
The Hong Kong-listed carrier said Thursday that it will inject 980 million yuan into its 49%-owned Air China Cargo Co., which is jointly operated with Air China, which owns the remaining 51% stake in the cargo operator.
Air China--China's flag carrier, which has a 30% stake in Cathay Pacific--will inject 1.02 billion yuan into the Shanghai-based air cargo joint venture. Cathay Pacific in turn holds a roughly 20% stake in Air China.
The capital injection into the freight operator comes as cargo yields, a measure of profitability, remain under pressure because of oversupply despite signs of a pickup in demand for air freight.
The International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, this year nearly doubled its air cargo growth forecast, to 4% for 2014 from 2.1%, signaling a turnaround after the industry lingered in the doldrums for nearly three years. However, analysts expect freight rates to stay weak as the region's airlines continue to boost capacity with new widebody passenger aircraft, whose greater belly space compared with older models will improve efficiency, as well as dedicated freighters.
Cathay Pacific said the capital injection would provide funds to assist Air China Cargo to adjust its fleet, reduce its operating costs and improve its operational performance.
It will also ""assist Air China Cargo to develop its cargo charter flight business with China Postal Airlines and to establish a sound and sustainable basis"" for the development of its overall business, it added. China Postal Airlines is the nation's first express cargo operator, established in 1996, and has a freighter fleet of 20, according to its website.
The two carriers in 2011 launched the joint venture to tap rising air freight between China and its trading partners. However, Air China Cargo has since remained unprofitable as a weak global economy and persistently high fuel prices battered demand for freight services. In 2013, the company's net losses narrowed to 349 million yuan, thanks to the retirement of older aircraft, which were less-fuel efficient. It didn't give year-earlier figures for comparison.
As of the end of 2013, Air China Cargo, which operates a fleet of eight freighters, flies to seven cities in mainland China and 10 cities outside the country.

"China, Philippines Argue Over South China Sea Plan; Philippines Accuses Beijing of Aggressively Pursuing Territorial Claims; China Rejects Philippine Proposal","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1552295769?accountid=14586,"Â  NAYPYITAW, Myanmar--China and the Philippines traded barbs over recent maritime tensions at a weekend gathering of regional foreign ministers, as Manila appeared to win muted support from Southeast Asian neighbors for its proposed freeze on provocative acts in the disputed South China Sea.
Both Beijing and Manila sought to steer the tone of talks, organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. China rejected the Philippine plan as disruptive to efforts to manage maritime disputes, while the Philippines accused Beijing of aggressively pursuing territorial claims and reneging on its commitment to peaceful diplomacy.
Asean acknowledged Manila's proposal but didn't adopt it, even though the U.S. and some Southeast Asian countries supported the idea. In a communiquÃ© published Sunday, the 10-state bloc instead renewed calls for restraint and greater urgency in creating a code of conduct for the South China Sea--an endeavor that has stalled over the last decade.
The outcome underscored China's sway over protracted dispute-resolution talks with Asean, while highlighting divisions between bloc members who prefer a tougher regional response against Beijing and others who are reluctant to antagonize a powerful economic partner.
""China's plan has been to stonewall diplomatically and trap Asean in these endless talks,"" said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy.
By playing off differences between Asean members, Beijing has been relatively unimpeded in pursuing its broad diplomatic strategy for the South China Sea, dictating the pace and content of talks to suit its interests, and preventing rival powers such as the U.S. from influencing the process, Mr. Thayer said.
The Philippine proposal, formally tabled during the Asean Regional Forum in Myanmar, came on the heels of heightened regional tensions. China deployed an oil rig in waters also claimed by Vietnam in early May, triggering a maritime standoff that only eased after Beijing moved the rig in mid-July, while Chinese and Philippine officials also bickered over disputed waters.
Manila sought a moratorium on such activities under its so-called ""triple-action plan,"" which also pushed for a speedy conclusion of a code of conduct in the South China Sea and urged that disputes be resolved through arbitration under international law.
The proposal received backing from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who attended the meeting. Some Asean members were also cautiously supportive, according to Singapore Foreign Minister K. Shanmugam.
But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi rejected the plan, saying Beijing wouldn't accept proposals that would ""interrupt"" ongoing conflict-resolution talks. He criticized Manila's separate push to have its dispute with Beijing settled through The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration, a process that China has declined to participate in.
""If the Philippines wish to pursue its three-step plan, it should withdraw its push for international arbitration and return to the first step,"" the Chinese official said. ""They've already skipped straight to the third step. Their behavior already contradicts their own proposals.""
In an interview, Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario dismissed Mr. Wang's criticisms, saying the triple-action plan conforms to principles that Beijing signed up to in a 2002 Asean-China declaration, which outlines a framework for resolving disputes in the South China Sea.
""They should have no problem with the plan--it's positive, it's constructive, it's comprehensive,"" Mr. Del Rosario said on the sidelines of the Asean meeting. ""China is trying to actualize their [claims] in advance of arbitration and the conclusion of a code of conduct,"" he said.
The South China Sea is traversed by more than half the world's trade and believed to hold vast energy reserves. China claims the waters almost in its entirety, contradicting rival claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.
Despite the discord between Beijing and Manila, Asean and Chinese diplomats said they were hopeful of reaching consensus about their ""commonalities"" on the contested waters, which could then facilitate talks on implementing the 2002 declaration and creating a code of conduct for the disputed waters.
The U.S., which sought in recent years to bolster its ties with Asean as part of its strategic rebalancing toward Asia, also expressed guarded optimism on the process.
""We were trying to put something on the table that people can embrace, and a number of countries have decided that's what they're going to do,"" Mr. Kerry told reporters Sunday. ""I think we'll see some progress with respect to the South China Sea based on the conversations we've had here.""
Analysts don't expect the Asean-China talks to produce significant headway soon.
Given Beijing's interest in prolonging negotiations, any consensus with its rival claimants would probably be watered down, said Mr. Thayer, who has been monitoring Asean-China talks on the South China Sea for over the past decade.
""The terms would likely to be defined so generally that they wouldn't yield any practical progress on the disputes,"" Mr. Thayer said.

"China Probes China Resources Power President Wang Yujun, Company Says; China Resources Power Holdings Says Prosectors Are Investigating Wang Yujun","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1556150929?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--Prosecutors in China are investigating Wang Yujun, president of state-owned China Resources Power Holdings Co., the second major official probe to hit the group this year, the company said.
The energy investment and production company said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late Tuesday that it has suspended Mr. Wang from his duties as company president, temporarily replacing him with company chairwoman Zhou Junqing, who also retains her current role. Mr. Wang couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Wang will remain an executive director of the company, pending the investigation's outcome, China Resources Power said.
The Communist Party in April ousted Song Lin , chairman of China Resources Holdings Co., the parent company of China Resources Power, accusing Mr. Song of unspecified ""suspected serious violations of discipline and law,"" phrasing Chinese authorities typically use in reference to corruption allegations.
Mr. Song's ouster followed allegations by a reporter for a newspaper owned by the government news agency Xinhua that Mr. Song abused his power in corporate dealings, for instance by personally benefiting from a coal mine acquisition. Mr. Song has been unavailable for comment. In the past he has denied accusations of wrongdoing in the Chinese media.
China Resources Power said Tuesday the probe into Mr. Wang by prosecutors in the eastern coastal province of Jiangsu won't affect the company's business operations.

Gucci Names Merinda Yeung as New China Chief; New Gucci China Chief Tasked With Turning Around Greater China Operations,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615291965?accountid=14586,"Â  Gucci's new China chief has a tough task: Make the Italian brand's name shine in a market where luxury is increasingly common.
The luxury brand on Thursday named Merinda Yeung, its Taiwan division chief, to run its China operations. Ms. Yeung is taking charge after a monthslong search to replace a predecessor who resigned after just 18 months on the job.
Ms. Yeung will oversee operations in a once-hot luxury market that recently has gone cold. Luxury brands in China have been hit by a rapid build-out by Gucci and others that flooded the market with high-end European names. The market has also been hurt by Beijing's crackdown on corruption, which sharply curtailed the practice of giving officials valuable baubles as gifts.
Ms. Yeung is a relative newcomer to Gucci, having joined the company in February. Before that, she was head of Singapore for Chanel and held positions in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vancouver with luxury brand Louis Vuitton. She wasn't immediately available for comment.
Speaking to analysts after Gucci's parent, Kering SA, reported third-quarter earnings Thursday, the group's chief financial officer, Jean Marc Duplaix, said that her main task would be to improve customers' experience in Gucci Chinese stores and better control distribution.
The Italian brand's head of China position has been empty since January, when former EstÃ©e Lauder executive Carol Shen left. A Gucci spokesman said the decision to let Ms. Shen go was mutual. In a recent interview, Ms. Shen said it was a culture clash, and that she joined the company at a time when the market was shifting dramatically--and the company was unable to shift with it.
""The brand lost sales and didn't have time to rebuild its brand equity or a sturdy foundation,"" she said.
The brand doesn't release Chinese sales figures, but HSBC Holdings PLC estimates sales there fell 2.3% to [euro]462 million ($584 million) last year. By comparison, sales grew 30% in 2011 and 21% in 2012, HSBC says. Gucci store traffic and employee retention have also taken a hit, according to interviews with former employees and retail experts.
Gucci Chief Executive Patrizio di Marco has said that the company is consolidating in the region after having grown too fast. ""We focused on dimension in China,"" he said, adding that sometimes ""when you run, you may forget you need to walk.""
On Thursday, Kering said that Gucci's China business is ""stabilizing,"" but revenues are still down. Sales in Hong Kong, instead, have further deteriorated in the quarter.
Kering added that global sales at the brand--which accounts for around 52% of the total luxury activities' sales--declined 1.6% to [euro]851 million in the third quarter from a year earlier.
Ms. Shen's tenure coincided with a Chinese government ban on spending by civil servants for luxury goods as part of a drive to root out corruption and enforce austerity. It also came after Gucci and others spent heavily on expanding in China--a move that made luxury commonplace and dimmed the luster of a host of European brands. Consumers began to fear they might show up at an event wearing the same luxury outfit as a friend or carrying the same purse, said James Button, a senior manager at Shanghai-based consultancy SmithStreet.
""It became a victim of being a popular brand and a recognizable brand,"" said Mr. Button.
Wei Hsin, a 27-year-old Beijing shop owner, said he likes to splurge on himself, but he would rather buy a $500 vintage Levi's jacket than anything new from an Italian luxury brand. ""Luxury means things that are hard to find,"" Mr. Wei said.
Ms. Shen said the Italian company was already taking steps to refurbish its image and was overhauling its internal management structure when she arrived. Steps included removing or playing down Gucci logos on products, to help stop the brand erosion. The company was also shifting management personnel to the mainland from Hong Kong.
Once Ms. Shen arrived, she said she looked for ways of running bigger stores and consolidating operations. In Beijing alone, Gucci has six stores--just one less than the number of outlets as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s eponymous brand. Under one deal with a mall developer, the Chinese company had subsidized outlets if Gucci opened them in its malls, according to people familiar with the matter. One flagship on a busy Shanghai shopping thoroughfare stands less than a kilometer away from another Gucci store.
A spokesman for Gucci said all store openings are a ""strategic decision"" based on location and commercial information. Openings aren't influenced by local incentives, he said, adding that ""opportunities that may arise as part of a negotiation are always evaluated carefully.""
Ms. Shen said she closed half a dozen stores in China during her tenure. The company now has 61.
But Ms. Shen said the industry was moving too fast, and that Gucci executives should have shifted their focus toward building sales with average individual buyers and away from bureaucratic gifting purchases long before China's austerity campaign hit. ""It was unfortunate timing,"" she said.
""Gifting has never been the main priority for Gucci in China,"" the spokesman for Gucci said, adding that the austerity campaign has had a ""general impact"" on the luxury sector. The spokesman said that before the austerity campaign Gucci had already adapted products reflecting the ""evolution in the luxury consumer"" in China.
Gucci isn't alone. China's luxury goods sales are expected to decline 2% in mainland China this year, posting the first fall in luxury sales in over a decade of growth, according to consultancy firm Bain & Co. Growth rates have progressively slowed after surging 20% in 2012. Italy's Prada SpA said in September that a slowdown in China contributed to a fall in its first-half profit, which slipped 21% to [euro]245 million, down from the same period a year earlier. Burberry Group PLC said earlier this monththat in its second quarter comparable-store sales growth (for stores open more than a year) fell to 8%, down from 12% in the first quarter. It didn't detail what the factors were but did note ""softening in growth from Chinese consumers both at home and when traveling.""
Ms. Shen said it is not unreasonable that Gucci is among those suffering. ""Gucci was the largest luxury brand in a market that was turning really soft,"" she said.

"China Growth Could Slow to 7.1%, PBOC Researchers Say; Researchers at China's Central Bank Say China's Growth Could Slow Next Year","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2014,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1635736948?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China's economy could see growth slow to 7.1% next year from about 7.4% this year as a domestic-property slump weighs on the world's second-largest economy, researchers from the nation's central bank said.
The researchers also said this would reflect what ruling Communist Party leaders have called a ""new normal"" of slower but higher-quality growth, reflecting government efforts to address widespread pollution and conserve energy to achieve a more sustainable economic expansion.
The estimates were made in a working paper published on the website of the People's Bank of China and dated Friday. It was described as not reflecting the official views of the central bank, though its authors included Ma Jun, the bank's chief economist.
China's economy has been hit by a prolonged property-market slump, which has had a substantial impact on construction activity and demand for key materials such as steel and cement, while global demand makes a slow and uneven recovery.
China's year-over-year economic growth came in at 7.3% in the third quarter, the slowest pace in five years. Some economists have suggested that growth for all of this year could fall short of the government's target of about 7.5%.
China's top policy makers held a key meeting last week to set economic priorities for 2015. They didn't announce any targets, but analysts had widely called for them to lower the growth target to about 7% to let policy makers focus on restructuring the economy so that consumption plays a bigger role and there is less reliance on government investment.
The paper warned of risks to emerging economies, which include China, from increases in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The level of risk depended on the pace and extent of those anticipated rate increases.
Fixed-asset investment, which reflects health in the property and construction sectors, was expected to fall to 12.8% next year from 15.5% this year, according to the working paper.
The researchers said that despite the slower growth next year, urban employment would likely remain relatively stable, aided partly by gains from the increasingly important services sector.
The working paper forecast an acceleration of exports to 6.9% growth from about 6.1% this year. Imports could expand 5.1% next year from 1.9% this year.
Consumer prices, which have remained tame this year, could increase slightly to a 2.2% rise, from about 2% this year.

The number of microblog users in China fell 11.4% last year to 248.8 million, compared with 280.8 million in 2013 , according to data released on Tuesday by the government-affiliated China Internet Network Information Center. Microblog users made up 38.4% of total Chinese Internet users last year, down from 45.5% in 2013.
The report said investment in microblogs--known as weibo in Chinese--fell among operators such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., Sohu.com Inc. and Netease Inc. It said use is increasingly focused on the service run by Weibo Corp., the spinoff from Sina Corp. that runs the best-known weibo service.
A year ago, the same group said use of the Twitter-like blogging services fell 9% in 2013 from 2012.

"China's Island Construction in South China Sea No Threat, Says Foreign Minister; Foreign Minister Wang Yi says work is lawful, necessary and in China's 'own yard'","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1661229232?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China's foreign minister defended his government's efforts to reclaim and develop land around disputed reefs and islands in the South China Sea, saying the work was ""necessary"" and posed no threat to other nations.
""This construction does not target or affect anyone,"" Wang Yi said at a news conference Sunday on the sidelines of an annual meeting of parliament.
""We are not like some countries who engage in illegal construction in another person's house, and we do not accept criticism from others when we are merely building facilities in our own yard. We have every right to do things that are lawful and justified.""
Satellite images show China has significantly expanded reclamation and construction work on several reefs it controls in the disputed Spratly Islands in the past two years, raising fresh concerns in the U.S. and Asia about increasing Chinese assertiveness in the region.
U.S. officials have spoken out in recent weeks against the construction work, which defense experts say could form a network of island fortresses to help enforce Chinese control of most of the South China Sea--one of the world's busiest shipping routes.
Vietnam publicly protested China's reclamation work last week. Vietnam and other countries with South China Sea claims have also built infrastructure on islands and reefs they control, but on a much smaller scale than China, U.S. officials and defense experts say.
China's claims cover almost all of the South China Sea, and overlap with those of Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, Taiwan and the Philippines--a U.S. treaty ally. Many of those countries have bolstered defense ties with the U.S. in recent years in response to what they see as Beijing's enhanced efforts to enforce its claims.
In the past year, China has tried to improve relations with its neighbors by unveiling plans for massive investment in roads, pipelines, ports and other infrastructure that it says will help to build new overland and maritime trade routes between Asia and Europe.
Mr. Wang said China had made progress in negotiations with India over their disputed Himalayan border, without giving details. China lodged an official protest last month when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited one of the disputed border areas.
Mr. Wang also didn't rule out inviting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to a military parade in China marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Asked if Mr. Abe would come, he said all world leaders were welcome at the parade ""as long as they come in sincerity."" But he reiterated China's stance that Japan needed to reflect on its wartime aggression.
Asked if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would attend the parade, on what would be his first visit to China since taking power in late 2011, Mr. Wang said the two sides would have to see when it was ""convenient"" for their leaders to meet.

"China's 'Great Wall of Sand' Raises U.S. Concerns; Land reclamation by China in South China Sea raises questions over Beijing's intentions, U.S. Pacific commander says","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1667519652?accountid=14586,"Â  CANBERRA, Australia--Unprecedented land reclamation by China in contested islands of the South China Sea is raising serious questions over whether Beijing intends confrontation or cooperation with other regional powers, America's top Pacific commander said.
In his most direct public criticism of Chinese construction on the contested Spratly Islands archipelago of the South China Sea, U.S. Pacific fleet Commander Admiral Harry Harris Jr. accused Beijing of building a ""great wall of sand"" over areas claimed by several nations.
""When one looks at China's pattern of provocative actions towards smaller claimant states--the lack of clarity on its sweeping nine-dash line claim that is inconsistent with international law, and the deep asymmetry between China's capabilities and those of its smaller neighbors--it's no surprise that the scope and pace of building man-made islands raises serious questions about Chinese intentions,"" Adm. Harris told a naval security conference in Australia.
Adm. Harris said China has created four square kilometers (1.5 square miles) of artificial land mass and construction is continuing.
""How China proceeds will be a key indicator of whether the region is heading towards confrontation or cooperation,"" he said.
China's muscle-flexing over territorial claims is stoking apprehension in nations including the Philippines and Vietnam, which earlier this month lodged a diplomatic protest with Beijing.
Australia, a longtime U.S. ally, has also expressed concern and last year signed a deal with Japan to bolster military cooperation and exercises as a hedge against China's fast-growing military clout.
Chinese officials couldn't immediately be reached to comment. China claims much of the South China Sea and has said Chinese construction activity in what it considers its waters is justified and reasonable.
The U.S., Adm. Harris said, remained committed to a rebalance of forces to the Pacific and said he was on track to have 60% of the U.S. Navy based in the Pacific Fleet by 2020, including the amphibious assault ship USS America, which he said could work with large new Australian assault ships.
""Consider the powerful synergy of HMAS Canberra and USS America working together in an amphibious operation somewhere,"" he said.
Rear Adm. Christopher J. Paul, the deputy commander of the U.S. Pacific surface fleet, earlier told the conference, organized by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, that the U.S. would move its latest Zumwalt stealth destroyers to the Pacific region to reassure allies. He also urged Australia's navy to consider deploying new warships in U.S.-led ""hunter-killer"" patrol groups.
Adm. Paul said a new generation of Australian warships, including missile destroyers, amphibious ships and frigates, might fit into a more muscular naval doctrine called ""distributed lethality,"" recently announced by the U.S. Navy.
""A shift to the offensive is necessary to create more favorable conditions to project power where required,"" Adm. Paul said.
Australian warships would be capable of operating as part of ""hunter-killer surface action groups"", he said, in which Australian amphibious ships could be paired with U.S. destroyers or Australian antiaircraft missile destroyers linked with Zumwalt destroyers.
The Pentagon is considering a plan to regularly move warships through Australia and wants to broaden maritime exercises with India, in an expansion of security ties that risked exacerbating rivalries with China. U.S. Marines and warplanes also move regularly through Australia's north.
Australia's Defense Minister Kevin Andrews told the same conference that the government was considering ramping up construction of its naval fleet on a continual basis to help preserve shipbuilding jobs and respond better to regional conflicts.
Australia's navy chief Vice Admiral Tim Barrett said in an interview that Canberra was still weighing how far it moves into the region, with a new strategic planning blueprint expected later this year. But future naval operations would become more multilateral, he said, with Australian ships mainly participating in task forces alongside allies.

China Cinda Bond Sale Shows Appetite in China Markets; A company created to clean up China's bad debt plans a $3 billion bond sale,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",20 15,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1672852463?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG--China Cinda Asset Management Co., a company created to clean up China's bad debt, is planning a $3 billion bond sale, underscoring investor appetite in China's markets even as the economy shows fresh signs of weakness.
The offering this week is set to total around $2 billion in international debt markets, a person familiar with the deal said. That is more than the $1.5 billion in bonds that Cinda sold globally in May last year, and the new issue will likely be sold at lower borrowing costs. The remaining $1 billion in bonds could be sold either domestically or internationally.
The interest in the debt mirrors the buying in Chinese stocks, with markets in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen all seeing big rallies recently as investors flood in.
Cinda bonds have been a favorite for international investors because the company is backed by Beijing and its debt yields are higher than investors get in most other places as global central banks keep interest rates low.
Cinda's $2.5 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong in late 2013 created a buying frenzy that included some of the world's best-known distressed-debt investors.
The company is known as a bad bank because it buys soured loans from banks and other companies. But in recent years, it has also expanded into buying out the debt between companies, mostly receivables.
Its maiden bonds issued last May have soared in price, with yields falling to 3.1% and 4.3% for the five- and 10-year bonds, respectively. That compares with 4% and 5.625% when they were issued. Bond yields fall as prices rise. Yields on Cinda's new bonds to be sold this week will be close to the old bonds' prevailing yield levels.
Beyond Cinda, which has an investment-grade rating, demand for riskier Chinese corporate debt has been picking up, sending prices of Asian junk bonds--dominated by Chinese property developers--soaring amid favorable mortgage policies and easing monetary conditions .
Higher yields have been a lure for investors. The extra yields, or credit spreads, above benchmark U.S. Treasurys offered by Chinese corporate bonds climbed to a peak of 3.8 percentage points in January from a low of three points in July last year, according to the J.P. Morgan Asia Credit Index. Although the spreads have retreated to 3.26 points as of Monday, they are still higher than counterparts in the U.S. or Europe, where interest rates are at rock-bottom levels.
This week, a number of Chinese firms are keeping the bond market busy. Haitong Securities Co., a major brokerage firm that has benefited from the recent stock-buying craze, state-owned infrastructure builder China Communications Construction Co., and developer Central China Real Estate Ltd., rated below investment grade, are also issuing bonds that bankers and analysts expect to be snapped up by investors.

China Puts Conciliatory Slant on Land Reclamation; China's navy chief said disputed reclaimed land in South China Sea could be used for joint rescue operations.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1677307002?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China's navy chief said artificial islands China has built in disputed parts of the South China Sea might in the future be used for joint rescue and disaster-relief operations, in unusually conciliatory remarks that follow stepped-up criticism in the U.S. and Asia over Beijing's land-reclamation work.
Adm. Wu Shengli, also told his U.S. counterpart, Adm. Jonathan Greenert, in a video conference that the facilities wouldn't affect freedom of navigation or overflight in the area, according to a report posted on the Chinese Defense Ministry website on Friday morning.
China claims almost all of the South China Sea--one of the world's busiest shipping lanes--and its reclamation work has raised fresh concerns in the U.S. and Asia that it is trying to use military force to assert those claims, which are disputed by several neighbors, including the Philippines, a U.S. ally.
U.S. military commanders have expressed concern that Beijing will use the facilities to establish an air-defense identification zone, similar to one it declared in 2013 over the East China Sea. Senior congressional figures have called for a slowdown in the expansion of military ties with Beijing.
Even the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, usually wary of antagonizing Beijing, issued a statement after a summit this week that didn't mention China specifically, but said reclamation work had ""eroded trust and confidence and may undermine peace, security and stability in the South China Sea"".
China was ""gravely concerned"" by that statement, Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, told a regular news briefing Tuesday. He repeated China's long-standing position that it has sovereignty over the area where the construction is taking place.
China has stepped up its own public efforts to defend its reclamation work in the last month, stating publicly for the first time that it will use the islands for military as well as civilian purposes, and providing details of reclamation work it says other claimant nations are doing in the area.
The report on the Defense Ministry website suggested Adm. Wu struck a less defiant tone on the subject in his video call on Wednesday with Adm. Greenert, the U.S. chief of naval operations, who has been one of the main proponents of closer military ties with China.
Adm. Wu said the reclamation work ""will not threaten freedom of navigation and overflight"" and will enhance the capacity for weather forecasting, maritime search and rescue and other public goods, and help to protect international maritime security, the report said.
""We welcome international organizations, the U.S. and relevant countries to use these facilities, when conditions are ripe, to conduct cooperation on humanitarian rescue and disaster relief,"" Adm. Wu was quoted as saying.
Adm. Wu reaffirmed China's commitment to improving military relations with the U.S., but also repeated a long-standing Chinese complaint about U.S. surveillance operations near China's coast, saying they weren't conducive to enhancing defense ties, the report said.
It quoted Adm. Greenert saying that he hoped China would explain the aims of its reclamation work to neighboring countries, and that its offer to allow others to use the artificial islands for humanitarian operations would help maintain peace and stability in the region.
A spokesman for Adm. Greenert didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sino Fantasy; Readers with even the most casual acquaintance with Asian history or current events in the South China Sea may not recognize the China of Liu Mingfu's 'China Dream.',"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1679226187?accountid=14586,"Â  According to Liu Mingfu, formerly a colonel in the People's Liberation Army and now a professor at China's National Defence University, the Chinese are simply ""the finest people on earth""--more numerous, more civilized, more harmonious than anyone else and more intelligent than Westerners. They are the foundation of Mr. Liu's ""Chinese democracy,"" which in his view explains his country's rapid rise in the past three decades and why he believes its economy will assume the world's No. 1 spot within the next 25 years.
Since this means deposing the U.S. as the world's current leader, conflict will be inevitable. But, according to Mr. Liu, China has never pre-emptively invaded another nation and has no intention to do so. Instead, it will take command without conquering, by creating ""a culture that exerts greater influence and is more attractive globally than America's.""
Nevertheless, a clean-handed and guilt-free China still needs a vast military machine to be built upon the moral high-ground that it occupies. ""The more powerful China becomes, the more reliable world peace will be."" Unless, of course, the U.S. tries to block China's ""peaceful rise,"" for instance by defending Taiwan. Then there will be war.
In other words, let us do exactly what we want, Mr. Liu is saying, or there will be trouble.
Readers with even the most casual acquaintance with Asian history or current events in the South China Sea may not recognize Mr. Liu's China, although his view that a U.S.-China conflict is inevitable is one of the commonplaces of contemporary political commentary. It might be expected that Mr. Liu would provide some evidence to support his case, but instead, in the manner typical of commentary produced for domestic consumption in China, he merely attempts to hypnotize his readers by endlessly repeating a list of unsupportable generalities.
Indeed, there's only enough material for a pamphlet in this unoriginal tour d'horizon of the officially approved clichÃ©s of Chinese self-admiration. It would be easier to learn Mr. Liu's main points simply by reading his section headings--what follows each of them typically amounts to little more than repetitions of the same claim using 10 times as many words.
Even when Mr. Liu does advance in the direction of fact, he shows little interest in accuracy and is often easily rebutted: China is not the only country ever to declare a nuclear no-first-strike policy. None of China's empires lasted remotely as long as the Roman Empire. German is not the only official language of Luxembourg.
Significantly, his claim that China has never invaded another country since it was first unified during the Qin dynasty (221-207 B.C.) will come as a surprise not only to historians but to any Vietnamese who can remember 1979.
But if truth is the first casualty of Mr. Liu's war, logic is another swiftly stretchered victim. Mr. Liu machine guns readers with quotes that run the intellectual gamut from Herodotus to Kissinger. The use of a famous name is supposed to be sufficient to clinch an argument. When none is available, throwaway phrases such as ""a Chinese expert"" or ""widely acknowledged by experts""--to add a suggestion of numerical support--will do. Myriad opposing experts go unmentioned and their counterarguments unexamined.
Mr. Liu also a master of the non sequitur. He claims that since a former colony's official language is often a legacy of its past colonial master, and since there are no countries outside China that have Mandarin as its official language, this is ""proof"" that China ""has never invaded other countries, and never tried to expand its territory."" Never mind that Mandarin is one of Singapore's official languages, or that the indigenous people of the two Chinese territories of Tibet and Xinjiang, for example, certainly consider themselves to be under occupation.
Terms that are inconvenient for Mr. Liu's views are simply redefined, with ""democracy"" being the first victim. When Napoleon conquered his neighbors, he was an invader. But when the first Chinese emperor, Qin Shihuang, did the same, he was merely ""solving the problem of uniting the empire."" Mr. Liu quotes without irony George Santayana's well-worn saying, ""those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" Yet he doesn't consider what happens to those who simply invent history.
This newly translated text appears not to have been updated since it first appeared in Chinese five years ago, and some of its predictions have already been falsified by recent events. ""Even if China's growth simply slowed, there would be serious consequences for the global economy,"" Mr. Liu says, as if the world would never let China's GDP fall below 9%.
Only in the final few pages of the book is the one-party system's culpability for China's endemic corruption and inequality admitted, and the assumption that all Chinese speak with the same Communist Party-approved voice finally abandoned.
What Mr. Liu does not say, of course, is that the U.S.-China conflict he predicts and the problems he acknowledges might be avoided by an orderly transition from totalitarian one-party rule to some form of genuine democracy.
That he is commonly labelled a hawk is unsurprising, but the label is inappropriate. Hawks, after all, are noted for their acute vision.

China Holds Ground Over South China Sea as U.S. Seeks Calmer Waters; U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calls for reduced tensions over China's building of artificial islands,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1681094587?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing is determined to protect its sovereignty in the South China Sea as his visiting U.S. counterpart John Kerry called for efforts to reduce tensions over China's stepped-up building of artificial islands .
At a joint news conference Saturday, Mr. Kerry briefly expressed concern about the land reclamation in the South China Sea and urged China to take steps to defuse the situation. He tried to emphasize other positive aspects of bilateral relations, such as cooperation on climate change.
Mr. Kerry didn't respond to a reporter's question on whether the U.S. military is planning to send warships or planes within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands , as first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.
Mr. Wang took up the question, however, saying the structures fall within the scope of China's sovereignty.
""The determination of the Chinese side to safeguard our own sovereignty and territorial integrity is as firm as a rock and it is unshakable,"" Mr. Wang said. ""It is the demand of our people on our government as well as a legitimate right of ours.""
Mr. Wang said China is committed to resolving territorial disputes peacefully and would continue ongoing talks about the artificial islands with the U.S. and other nations.
The two men had met earlier for talks on the first day of Mr. Kerry's weekend visit to Beijing, which officials say is designed to lay the ground for high-level meetings by senior officials in Washington in June, and a state visit to the U.S. by Chinese President Xi Jinping in September.
Mr. Kerry was due to meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Saturday afternoon and Mr. Xi on Sunday before moving on to South Korea.
The visit to Beijing has been overshadowed by differences on the South China Sea, where Beijing's extensive land reclamation in the past year has raised fresh concerns in Asia and the U.S. that it plans to use force to assert its sweeping territorial claims.
China's claims cover almost all of the South China Sea--one of the world's busiest shipping routes--and overlap with those of several neighboring countries, including the Philippines, a U.S. treaty ally.
The U.S. military is now considering sending navy ships and aircraft within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands to demonstrate that the U.S. doesn't believe China can claim territorial seas around them, U.S. officials say.
Ahead of Mr. Kerry's visit, U.S. officials had said that he would take a tough line on the issue in Beijing.
At the news conference, Mr. Kerry said the U.S. had already expressed its concern over the pace and scope of China's island-building.
""I urged China through Foreign Minister Wang to take actions that will join with everybody in helping to reduce tensions and increase the prospect of a diplomatic solution,"" he said. The region, he said, needs ""smart diplomacy"" to achieve a code of conduct for the South China Sea rather than ""outposts and military strips.""
Mr. Kerry also played down other points of recent tension, saying the U.S. welcomed China's establishment of an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank . The Obama administration at first tried to discourage allies from joining, U.S. officials and diplomats from allied countries have said, but switched to a more cooperative position when the bank, which is due to start operating this year, attracted many prospective members.
Mr. Wang said the infrastructure bank and other recent Chinese initiatives weren't aimed at reducing U.S. influence in Asia, noting that 23 of the 57 founding members of the new bank were not Asian nations.
""When we talk about openness and inclusiveness, we're not simply talking the talk--we're actually walking the walk,"" Mr. Wang said.

China to Build Military Facilities on South China Sea Islets; China says land reclamation in Spratly islands will be completed in the coming days,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1688411102?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China said it is shifting work on disputed South China Sea islets from the dredging of land to the construction of military and other facilities as it pushes forward with a program that has aggravated tensions with the U.S. and neighbors.
In a statement on its website Tuesday, China's Foreign Ministry said land reclamation on some islands and reefs in the Spratlys chain ""will be completed in the upcoming days"" as planned. Beijing will then proceed to build facilities on those features that will serve military and civilian purposes , the statement said.
Analysts say the imminent end to China's island-building work could signal a willingness to seek compromise with Washington and rival claimants in the South China Sea, even as it demonstrates Beijing's ability to unilaterally dictate terms in the long-standing dispute.
""This is a step toward halting land reclamation, which the U.S. has demanded, and at the same time, China can tell its people that it has accomplished what it wanted to do,"" said Huang Jing, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.
""China unilaterally started the land reclamation and now China is unilaterally stopping it,"" Mr. Huang said. ""China is showing that--as a major power--it can control escalation, that it has the initiative, and that it can do what it sees fit for its interests.""
Beijing lays claim to almost the entire South China Sea, a stretch of resource-rich waters that carries more than half the world's trade. Its claims overlap with those of Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, Taiwan and the Philippines--several of whom have criticized China's rapid and extensive construction program in the Spratlys as the latest in a series of aggressive Chinese efforts to assert territorial rights.
According to U.S. estimates, China has expanded artificial reefs in the Spratlys to as much as 2,000 acres of land, up from 500 acres last year. U.S. officials have said that China's island-building program includes transforming semi-submerged reefs into forward bases with airfields fit for military use, while U.S. surveillance recently detected two motorized artillery pieces on one of the Chinese-controlled artificial islands.
Other claimants to the Spratlys--including Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines --have all expanded the geographical features they control, but not as quickly as China, analysts say.
The Philippines' Foreign Ministry said it is awaiting official confirmation from Beijing on its Tuesday statement, while the Vietnamese and Malaysian foreign ministries and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Washington says it doesn't take sides in the South China Sea disputes, but that it has an interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the area. To this end, the Obama administration is considering ways to challenge the island-building campaign, weighing whether to deploy Navy vessels or aircraft close the islands to signal to China that it can't close off international waters.
China's Foreign Ministry again on Tuesday defended the building work as ""lawful, reasonable and justified"" activity conducted within its sovereign territory.
""They are not targeted at any other country [and] do not affect the freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in accordance with international law in the South China Sea,"" ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in the statement.
While the artificial islands do serve military needs, their main purpose is to facilitate noncombat and civilian activity, such as maritime search and rescue, disaster relief, scientific research and environmental protection, Mr. Lu said.
The timing of China's statement, meanwhile, showed that Beijing is conducting the building program ""in accordance with its own timetable and plan [and] reflects transparency in China's relevant policies,"" Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the Foreign Ministry-affiliated China Institute of International Studies, told state broadcaster CCTV in a televised interview.
China's statement came on the final day for Beijing to submit comments to an international arbitration tribunal that is considering the Philippines' territorial claims in the South China Sea.
The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague will hold a hearing next month on whether it has jurisdiction in the matter and whether Manila's claims are admissible for arbitration. The appeal to the court has angered Beijing, which has said it would neither accept nor participate in the process, arguing that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the dispute.

"China Faces Rare Cement Dust-Up; A bidding war could be brewing for one of China's largest cement makers, China Shanshui","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1697753985?accountid=14586,"Â  One of China's largest cement makers may be the ground for a rare Chinese takeover battle. The would-be acquirers want to be stronger cement makers. But investors across the industry should be pleased if this deal paves the road for more consolidation.
China Shanshui Cement said Tuesday that two of its major shareholders, fellow cement makers Asia Cement Corp. and China National Building Material, are interested in making a cash offer for the 62% of Shanshui that they don't own. No price has been disclosed. Shanshui's shares haven't traded since April, but as of then it had a market capitalization of $2.7 billion.
The shares have been frozen because the public float went below Hong Kong's minimum requirements after yet another cement maker, Tianrui Group, bought a 28% stake in Shanshui, becoming its largest shareholder.
Asia Cement and CNBM could now be making an open offer so they can push Tianrui aside, perhaps because they find it too meddlesome. Tianrui wants to install new directors on Shanshui's board.
Tianrui may oppose Asia Cement's offer, given its keen interest in the company. Investors now have to wonder if Tianrui will make a rival offer of its own.
The country's fragmented cement sector is long overdue for consolidation. The top three producers in China control less than a third of nationwide capacity, compared with a global average of more than two-thirds, according to Deutsche Bank's Johnson Wan.
With a weak construction market hitting cement sales, big companies need to claw for market share . For CNBM, an alliance with Shanshui would mean a dominant market share exceeding 60% in eastern Shandong province. But Tianrui, which operates in adjoining Henan province, also wants Shanshui's business for similar reasons. Shanshui's margins are low and its debt high, which is why it may be willing to be taken over.
Shanshui shares last traded 25% above the price that implies the replacement cost for its assets, based on Mr. Wan's calculations earlier this year. So Asia Cement and CNBM are likely to offer only a slight premium to that. But if Tianrui tries to counter, a bidding war could ensue. Or, given the involvement of state shareholders, a quieter deal could be worked out.
Either way it is good news for Shanshui shareholders. For investors in CNBM, Asia Cement or Tianrui, much depends on price. Tianrui's listed company, China Tianrui Group Cement, already carries net debt equal to 108% equity, so it isn't in a position to pay too much--though the parent company may be in a better position to do a deal. China National has an even weaker balance sheet, though Taiwan-listed Asia Cement's 25% net-debt-to-equity ratio offers ammunition.
Chinese cement makers have struck at least 16 deals since 2014. If the 17th morphs into a takeover battle, that's a good sign of the industry's desire to strengthen its foundation.

China Railway Signal Raises $1.42 Billion in Hong Kong IPO; China Railway Signal & Communication prices the deal at the lower end of price range as China shares tumble,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1700437634?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG--State-owned China Railway Signal & Communication Corp. raised US$1.42 billion after pricing its Hong Kong initial public offering at the lower end of an indicative price range, as turmoil in China's stock market took a toll on demand for the rail-signal maker's shares.
The world's largest maker of train traffic control systems sold 1.75 billion new shares at 6.3 Hong Kong dollars (81 U.S. cents) each, a person familiar with the situation said Saturday, making the deal Hong Kong's fourth-biggest IPO this year.
China Railway Signal priced the deal at the lower end of its HK$6.30 to HK$8.00 indicative price range even as the company had secured cornerstone investors for more than half the IPO shares before taking orders. Cornerstone investors, who usually commit to hold the stock for months after a company's listing, help boost other investors' confidence in the company.
In Hong Kong, bankers can sell part of the shares to be floated in an offering to cornerstone investors before official order-taking begins.
Big listings this year in the city include the US$5 billion IPO in May by Chinese securities firm HTSC, better known as Huatai Securities, and the US$4.1 billion IPO by rival GF Securities Co. in March, according to data provider Dealogic. China Railway Signal's IPO ranks below the US$1.98 billion fundraising by Chinese conglomerate Legend Holdings Corp. in June.
Investors' appetite for IPOs has been hit by slumping Chinese stock markets . China's shares suffered their worst month in nearly six years in July, after confidence in a government-led recovery wavered earlier last week, knocking shares lower. The Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 14% in July, its worst monthly performance since August 2009, while Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped 6% during the period.
The 16 cornerstone investors that bought into China Railway Signal included several state-owned firms. China Railway Group took $100 million worth of shares and life insurer China Life Insurance Co. agreed to buy $50 million.

China Says It Is Ending Its Island-Building Effort,"Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1701690725?accountid=14586,"Â  Corrections & Amplifications
Around $5 trillion in maritime trade passes through the South China Sea every year. A News article Thursday about Beijing saying it has halted land-reclamation efforts in the South China Sea incorrectly said the amount of trade is around $5 billion.
(WSJE August 7, 2015)
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- China's foreign minister said at a Southeast Asian summit that it had halted land-reclamation efforts in the disputed South China Sea, in an attempt to smooth tensions with its territorial rivals but the announcement was greeted with skepticism by U.S. officials.
While Beijing already had said it would halt its island-building projects, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters Wednesday that the controversial activities had stopped. But U.S. officials questioned whether China had really halted its land-reclamation drive.
Mr. Wang was apparently trying to reassure neighboring countries about China's intentions during meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this week in Malaysia, involving the 10 Asean members and other Asia-Pacific countries, including China and the U.S.
Billing China as the region's indispensable partner, Mr. Wang told Asean that China has the money, technology and know-how to help the countries develop their infrastructure and grow their economies.
China's construction of artificial islands in at least seven locations in the disputed Spratly Islands during the past year damaged China's image in parts of Southeast Asia, particularly upsetting rival South China Sea claimants Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. China claims almost all of the South China Sea and says it has the right to build there.
China's decision to forge ahead with the artificial islands, despite its neighbors concerns, has unsettled several countries. On Tuesday, Asean Secretary-General Le Luong Minh said China's expansionism in the South China Sea was ""dangerous"" and eroded the trust between China and Asean.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Asean countries should work together to address China's territorial challenge. The Philippines and Vietnam have both repeatedly protested Beijing's island-building program.
Mr. Wang offered a new 10-point plan to boost China-Asean relations, which he said would overtake any territorial frictions. In doing so, he presented China as a force for good in Southeast Asia. ""China has no intention of competing with other countries"" when it comes to working with Southeast Asia to spur development, he said.
China has accused the U.S. of sowing dissent in the region by talking up the issue of the South China Sea disputes and encouraging regional allies like the Philippines to stand up to Beijing. China is also wary of the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free-trade group from which China is currently excluded.
U.S. officials played down the foreign minister's comments about halting land reclamation, saying Washington is skeptical that the work had stopped. Even if there has been a pause in construction, U.S. officials said it would be difficult to determine whether the stoppage was permanent or temporary.
Earlier Wednesday Mr. Wang met with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who had called for a freeze on China's reclamation activities in the run-up to the talks in the Malaysian capital.
Mr. Kerry ""encouraged China. . .to halt problematic actions,"" according to a senior U.S. official familiar with the discussions. ""Secretary Kerry reiterated his concern about rising tensions over disputed claims in the South China Sea and China's large scale reclamation, construction and militarization of features there,"" the official said.
Satellite images reveal that China has been building a large airstrip on one of these man-made features, raising concerns that Beijing may attempt to enforce an air-defense identification zone in the South China Sea.
The U.S. has made it clear that it will oppose any attempt to limit freedom of navigation in the disputed sea, through which around $5 billion in maritime trade passes annually.
Mr. Wang said the opportunities of China-Asean cooperation far outweighed any tensions, noting that Southeast Asian countries had responded positively to recent Chinese development initiatives, such as Beijing's new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and its Maritime Silk Road project designed to boost regional commerce.

"China Resumes Slide, Leading Asian Shares Lower; The swift drop in China shares accelerated, with two-day losses just shy of 10%, a signal that China's latest efforts to hold its markets steady are falling short.","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1704865805?accountid=14586,"Â  The swift drop in China shares accelerated Wednesday, with two-day losses just shy of 10%, a signal that China's latest efforts to hold its markets steady are falling short.
The Shanghai Composite Index is down 5% to 3559.80 and the smaller Shenzhen Composite shed 5% to 2065.07. The losses follow a 6.1% drop in China's main index on Tuesday. So far, two-day losses for Shanghai and Shenzhen come in at 9.3% and 9.5%, respectively.
Worries about the health of China's economy has spread to the markets of some of its trading partners in the region. The Nikkei Stock Average was down 0.5% while South Korea's Kospi fell 1.6%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.1% and a gauge of Chinese companies listed in the city is down 1.5%.
Investor jitters come despite the central bank's latest moves to stem outflows from China, after devaluing its currency last week. On Tuesday, the People's Bank of China poured the largest amount of cash into the financial system on a single day in almost 19 months.
Despite the latest stock turmoil, the Chinese currency has held relatively steady after the central bank devalued the yuan by nearly 2% last week. On Wednesday, China's central bank set the yuan's trading midpoint nearly flat with the level a day earlier, at 6.3963 per U.S. dollar. The currency can trade within a 2% band above or below that. The onshore yuan is currently 6.3990 against the U.S. dollar.
In Japan, the latest economic data signals the growing reach of a slowdown in China, which accounts for about a fifth of Japan's exports and imports. On Wednesday, Japan reported a monthly deficit in July of Yen268.1 billion ($2.15 billion), the fourth straight month of shortfall, after exports rose 7.6% on year but imports fell 3.2%.
Exports rose as robust shipments to the U.S. offset sluggish exports to China. Imports fell as sliding oil prices reduced the cost of purchasing gas and oil from the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
Still, the prospect of slackening demand from China, one of the world's largest consumers of oil, metals and food, and concerns about oversupply have pushed many commodities to multiyear lows, particularly industrial metals.
Overnight, copper futures fell below $5,000 a metric ton for the first time since the financial crisis. On Wednesday, Brent crude oil futures were down 0.6% at $48.52. One bright spot was Australia's S&PASX 200, up 0.8%, with gains in what had been the most-battered sectors: banks and energy stocks.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd. reported first-half net profit in line with expectations, of $679 million and held its full-year production target. Shares currently are up 1.8%.
Still, challenges remain on the horizon. IG Market strategist Evan Lucas said the macroeconomic backdrop and state of commodities markets makes it hard for investors to be positive.
""The ASX is well and truly caught up in macro-fear currently,"" Evans says, noting the index is down 11.6% from an April high of 5999. Hiroyuki Kachi and Robb M. Stewart contributed to this article.

"Pentagon Says China Has Stepped Up Land Reclamation in South China Sea; Report says China has reclaimed 2,900 acres across disputed Spratly islands","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1705602232?accountid=14586,"Â  WASHINGTON--A new Pentagon report says China's reclamation of landmass among a string of artificial islands in the South China Sea has grown dramatically in recent months, and that Beijing is aggressively patrolling the waters there to assert its territorial claims.
The Pentagon report, issued late Thursday, said that, as of June, China has reclaimed 2,900 acres of landmass across a string of islands in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys, up nearly 50% from May, when the Pentagon said Beijing had claimed about 2,000 acres.
Washington fears that the islands will be used for military purposes and could create instability in one of the world's biggest commercial shipping routes as China lays claim to what several other countries see as international waters. And, as China's assertiveness grows, the risk of conflict with the U.S. and its allies grows along with it, defense officials have said.
The report comes about a month before a high-profile visit to Washington by Chinese President Xi Jinping, where the South China Sea issue, along with cybersecurity and monetary policy are likely to come up. Taken together, the issues portend a potentially difficult visit for Mr. Xi and for the Obama administration.
The rate of growth of the islands from China's development activity has accelerated considerably, according to the report, which is titled ""The Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy"" and was required by Congress in a 2015 defense bill.
The new Pentagon report reflects continuing U.S. skepticism of China's claims earlier this month that it has halted its land reclamation activity. China said in early August that it had ceased reclamation operations, but U.S. officials questioned whether the actions had been stopped or would remain halted.
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington said late Thursday that China stopped reclamation in June. The spokesman, Zhu Haiquan, said that the facilities being built on the islands include those for the public good.
""China stands ready to open these facilities to other countries upon completion,"" Mr. Zhu said. ""We hope the U.S. side will view this in an objective and balanced way and respect regional countries' efforts to maintain the peace and stability of the South China Sea.""
While not directly contradicting the Chinese claim, a Pentagon spokesman challenged Beijing late Thursday to elaborate on its plans.
""We encourage China to clarify whether this statement applies to all Chinese outposts in the Spratlys and Paracels, and whether China is permanently committing to stop further reclamation activities,"" the spokesman said.
Before this year, defense officials estimated that Beijing had only reclaimed about 500 acres of landmass to build the artificial islands, mostly built atop of semi-submerged reefs by using dredged material from the seafloor.
The islands are big enough to erect buildings and house equipment, and, in one case, support a 3,000-foot runway.
Several of China's neighbors make claims to the islands, including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines,Taiwan and Vietnam.
But China's reclamation projects are far more aggressive than its neighbors', the report says. In less than two years, China has reclaimed 17 times more land than any other claimant has in the past 40 years--accounting for about 95% of all reclaimed land in the Spratlys, according to the report.
Vietnam has reclaimed about 80 acres, Malaysia has reclaimed 70 acres, the Philippines has reclaimed 14 acres and Taiwan has reclaimed eight acres, the report says.
In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. surveillance confirmed the Chinese had placed two mobile artillery units on one of the artificial islands known as Johnson Reef.
Beijing says that construction of the islands, which sit about 700 miles off the Chinese coastline, is well within its rights as a sovereign nation. In a statement on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry reiterated its position that the South China Sea isn't a U.S.-China issue and that it ""is resolving disputes with countries directly concerned through negotiation and consultation.""
The report indicated that at some sites, China has excavated deep channels and has built new berthing areas to allow access for larger ships that could be used to assert territorial claims.
""Though other claimants have reclaimed land on disputed features in the South China Sea, China's latest efforts are substantively different from previous efforts both in scope and effect,"" the report said. ""The infrastructure China appears to be building would enable it to establish a more robust power projection presence into the South China Sea.""
Meanwhile, China is ramping up patrols of the area, taking ""small, incremental steps"" in the disputed areas that avoid military conflict, but work to ""increase its effective control"" over the islands, the report said. The report also cites expanded use of the Chinese Coast Guard, which Beijing is using to enforce its claims in both the East and South China Seas.
""China prefers to use its government-controlled, maritime law enforcement ships in these disputes, and operates [People's Liberation Army Navy] vessels over the horizon so they are ready to respond to escalation,"" the report says.
Although China isn't the only country to use nonmilitary assets to conduct ""worrying or dangerous actions"" against other countries in the region, China's use of such vessels ""has been, by far, the most active,"" the report said.
Some U.S. military leaders have pushed the Pentagon to be more aggressive in countering China's moves in the South China Sea, arguing for more assertive maritime and air patrols to fly within the 12 nautical mile territorial limit of some of the disputed islands that China claims. But some officials inside the Pentagon and at the White House say they have resisted flying such patrols for fear of provoking China.
Concerns linger that, if left unchecked, China's claims to the islands could destabilize one of the world's busiest commercial shipping routes.
On Thursday, Defense Secretary Ash Carter reiterated to reporters that the military would fly and steam where and when it wanted. But it remains unclear if the U.S. has ever actually flown or navigated to within the 12-nautical mile zone of those islands, which would likely result in a response from Beijing.
""The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law permits,"" Mr. Carter said. ""As we've always the right to do, we will continue to do that, and none of this is going to change our conduct in any way.""

How Brazil's China-Driven Commodities Boom Went Bust; Developing nation's big bet on China turns sour as China's appetite for exports dims; 'looking at a lost decade',"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1707693474?accountid=14586,"Â  SÃO PAULO--Not long ago, Brazil stood as the leading example of how a developing nation could rise toward global prominence on the force of a China-driven commodity boom.
As its economy surged, Brazil stormed the world stage--hosting a World Cup, demanding more say at the United Nations and blocking a U.S. free-trade plan for the Americas.
Now Brazil is looking like a symbol of something else: resource-rich nations' habit of ending their booms with spectacular busts.
Brazil's stock market is down 22% in the past year. Its currency has lost a third of its value against the dollar. And on Friday, Brazil is expected to report that in the second quarter, its economy shrank at a pace of about 1.7%. Economists are voicing fears of prolonged stagnation.
China has caused turmoil in many places, but none more so than in this prime supplier of commodities to a country whose once-voracious appetite for them has dimmed. Brazil's pain from China's slowdown isn't largely confined to the financial markets, as in some countries, but goes to the heart of its real economy.
""We went from Brazil mania to Brazil nausea,"" said Marcos Troyjo, a former Brazilian diplomat who leads a Columbia University center studying emerging markets. ""We are looking at a lost decade, where growth stagnates, inflation is high, and, most sadly, a decade where you've learned nothing.""
For Brazilians who believed, as their leaders were saying, that the country would climb to first-world status during the resources boom, the downturn has come as a profound disappointment. Big antigovernment demonstrations are now regular events: Protesters decry the corruption that a sweeping investigation is uncovering, and many call for President Dilma Rousseff's ouster. As inflation nears double-digits and as unemployment and interest rates rise, middle-class households are starting to miss car payments and the poor are eating less meat.
""Beef is the first to go!"" said Janeide Ferreira, a 54-year-old cleaner in Rio de Janeiro who must take a sweaty two-hour bus ride to work each day from the slum where she lives. ""Things were so much better five years ago.""
Brazil is in danger of losing its investment-grade rating, to judge by the negative views of credit-rating firms, potentially sparking a disorderly currency decline.
Some wealthy Brazilians aren't sticking around to find out. Rich Brazilians are snapping up homes from South Florida to Scarsdale, N.Y., often with the long-term plan of raising families there. A cover story on the phenomenon in the weekly magazine IstoÃ© this month is titled: ""Bye-Bye Brazil.""
Poised to Benefit
Looking back, it is easy to understand the frenzy of optimism. If the biggest economic story this century was China's rise, Brazil was uniquely poised to benefit from it.
Rich in iron ore, soybeans and beef, not to mention oil, Brazil was positioned as a supplier of many things China needed. Its annual trade with China, only around $2 billion in 2000, soared to $83 billion in 2013. China supplanted the U.S. as Brazil's largest trading partner.
China's rise helped spur global investors to pour more than $1 trillion a year into emerging markets by 2011, a fivefold increase in a decade. Brazil was a leading destination. Because its securities markets were more transparent than China's, some investors bought Brazil as way to play China.
In the midst of this, Brazil's state-controlled oil company made a huge deep-water discovery, at a time when oil analysts were focused on tight supply and prices were rising. Voters in this nation of deep economic inequality had elected a president who rose from poverty, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. He positioned himself as a voice for millions being lifted in the commodities boom, clinching Rio de Janeiro's right to host the 2016 Olympics in a stirring speech saying the games would be a gift to the poor.
But Brazil had boomed several times in past decades, only to go bust. A 1966-1973 expansion was dubbed the ""Brazilian Miracle."" What followed it in the 1980s was a tumultuous decade of hyperinflation, debt crises and falling living standards.
This time was supposed to be different. In digging out from the 1980s mess, Brazil had cut spending, stabilized its currency and tamed the four-digit inflation. A combination of fiscal rectitude and increasingly competent government was meant to allow Latin America's biggest economy to converge with advanced nations such as the U.S.
The longtime quip about Brazil had been that ""it's the country of the future--and always will be."" In 2005, a book by a Brazilian economist was titled ""The Future Arrived.""
Brazil, one of the emerging-market investment darlings known as the ""BRIC"" countries (which also included Russia, India and China), turned in a sterling growth rate of 7.6% in 2010. Global development experts started talking about exporting the ""Brazil model"" to other emerging nations.
Mr. da Silva envisioned the China-based commodity windfall as funding new roads, ports, dams and industries such as shipbuilding. Brazil was taking its place among the world's developed nations. Officials began traveling to investor meetings with a booklet suggesting their economy would grow at an average of about 4.5% a year in perpetuity.
It wasn't to be. Brazil fell under what some economists call the ""resource curse,"" a theory describing how countries with abundant natural resources sometimes do worse than countries without them. The idea is that the money from commodity sales can lead to overvalued currencies and shortsighted policy-making, leaving such countries badly exposed when the resource boom finally ends.
""Unfortunately, the history is that commodity-dependent economies do not catch up with the U.S.,"" said Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ""Not just oil producers. More countries end up being poorer, compared with the U.S., after they find a commodity than catch up."" Using data going back to 1800, he said commodity-dependent economies typically grow for a decade, then spend as long as two decades wallowing or slipping back.
Some reasons are structural. The influx of hard currency from commodity exports strengthens a country's own currency, which can toughen conditions for non-commodity industries such as manufacturing by hampering exports and making imports cheaper. At the height of Brazil's boom, Goldman Sachs declared Brazil's currency, the real, the world's most overvalued. Movies and taxis in downtown SÃ£o Paulo were more expensive in dollar terms than in New York. Brazil's manufacturers began contracting.
Many of Brazil's problems were homegrown, though, said Alexandre Schwartsman, a former Brazilian central-bank official: ""We managed to produce this recession ourselves.""
Buoyed by China trade, nationalist-minded politicians launched a foreign policy meant to reduce the role of the U.S. in Latin America. Brazil blocked a U.S. free-trade initiative for the Americas. They teamed with Venezuela to create a regional security council to supplant one that included the U.S. The foreign minister worked from an office with a huge map of the world upside down, offering the message that the era of emerging markets was at hand.
But the world wasn't upside down. While Brazil tied itself more closely to anti-American governments like Venezuela, Argentina and Iran, some regional neighbors--Chile, Colombia and Peru--went around Brazil and cut individual free-trade deals with the U.S.
Brazil also started spending its commodity windfall before its oil and ore were out of the ground--another feature of the resource curse.
Anticipating commodity sales, the government spent increasingly heavily. Government banks supplied Brazilians with easy credit. Brazil subsidized energy bills, issued cheap loans to big companies with government ties and built stadiums to host global events such as the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.
Brazil's national development bank, BNDES, lent so much that its loan portfolio became bigger than the World Bank's, making many loans at below-market rates.
Other investments failed to pay long-term returns. The credit-driven consumer boom ran out of gas, and some World Cup stadiums sit unused.
Meantime, Brazil produced far less oil than predicted. Production actually shrank in some years, as PetrÃ³leo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, struggled with the enormous task of developing oil fields in extremely deep water.
Officials sometimes budgeted as if oil and ore prices would stay high, in what economists call another common mistake of resource-rich nations.
Consider Vale SA, a mining giant with close government ties. As China's demand for construction materials lifted iron-ore prices in Brazil to $126 a ton from $19 between 2000 and 2011, Vale executives began a $16 billion expansion of their main iron-ore complex and ordered a fleet of super-large ""Valemax"" ships to carry ore to China.
When China's growth began to slow, Vale's ferrous-division director, JosÃ© Carlos Martins, kept telling investors iron-ore prices would remain high. In dismissing analyst concerns on a July 2014 conference call, he said, ""It's amazing how much you focus on China.""
Mr. Martins left voluntarily that year as iron ore headed south. He said his forecasts were thrown off by oil's drop and the dollar's appreciation, noting: ""In the corporate world, you spend half your life making forecasts and the other half explaining why that forecast was wrong."" Vale has cut its dividend and sold some ships, but is pushing ahead with the mine project.
Corruption scandal
Commodities' support of the economy allowed Brazilian leaders to put off addressing certain problems that had long bedeviled the nation, such as a political system that tended to breed corruption and a bureaucracy that stymied business innovation. ""Brazil became complacent because of the intoxicating effects of China trade,"" said Thomas Trebat, a former emerging-markets investment banker who directs Columbia University's Columbia Global Centers in Rio de Janeiro. ""Now they are suffering a hangover.
The commodity boom may even have turbocharged some unhealthy practices. Brazilian prosecutors are looking into the activities of dozens of executives and politicians in a sweeping bribery and kickback investigation centered on activities at Petrobras as the oil giant spent heavily to develop its offshore field.
Though corruption has long plagued the country, the figures this time have shocked even jaded Brazilians. Petrobras says at least $2 billion was stolen from it in the past decade. One executive indicted in the probe has agreed to return nearly $100 million. The leader of the lower house in Congress, Eduardo Cunha, is being investigated on suspicion of taking $5 million. He denies it.
Brazil's electoral court has authorized investigations of whether some of the corruption helped fund Ms. Rousseff's 2014 re-election campaign. The treasurer of her Workers Party has been jailed on an accusation, which he denies, of money laundering. Ms. Rousseff and her party deny any wrongdoing.
Amid the downturn, the government is fracturing, hindering its ability to turn things around. Ms. Rousseff's public approval rating is down to 8%. Her vice president, Michel Temer, recently said he is no longer pursuing a vice president's usual role of helping the president get things done in Congress, prompting speculation he wants her job. ""Someone needs to unify everyone...because otherwise the country could enter into an ugly crisis,"" Mr. Temer said this month.
Ms. Rousseff and her advisers defend her policies, saying the downturn would have been worse had her government not expanded the social safety net and provided subsidies to industries to help them avoid laying off workers.
While Brazil's economy is forecast to contract by 2% this year, government officials are hoping the outlook improves next year as Ms. Rousseff introduces measures to streamline the government and works to rekindle good relations with the U.S. Brazil's now-weaker currency might help revive manufacturing and exports. In addition, the country has $371 billion in central-bank reserves to cushion the slump.
""We're renovating the foundations of the economy, and we will resume growing with all of our potential,"" Ms. Rousseff said this month.
But China is the X-factor. Brazil's exports to China tumbled by 19% in the first seven months of this year.
For more than a decade, China has been there when Brazil needed it most. Brazil entered the latest commodity upswing, around 2002, verging on default, but Brazil's economy began to catch fire from resource prices buoyed by Chinese demand.
Brazil then again looked as if it could come undone after the global financial crisis in 2008. China's $586 billion stimulus package helped reignite global demand for what Brazil produces.
Even now, Brazil is looking to China for help. In May, Ms. Rousseff met in BrasÃ­lia with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. At a time when some global investors were starting to shun Brazil, China agreed to lend Petrobras $10 billion. The Chinese government also said it would consider investing in Brazilian railroads, ports and roads. Whether these things come to fruition is now a question, as China's own economy slows.

China's Forex Reserves Fall by Record $93.9 Billion on Yuan Intervention; China's Forex War Chest Takes Hit; China's Forex War Che st Takes Hit; China's Forex War Chest Takes Hit; China's forex reserves fall by record $93.9 billion on yuan intervention; China's Forex Reserves Fall by Record $93.9 Billion as PBOC Intervenes -- 2nd Update; China's Forex Reserves Fall by Record $93.9 Billion; China's Forex Reserves Fall by Record $93.9 Billion on Yuan Intervention; PBOC has been selling its dollar holdings to prevent the yuan from sliding further,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1709693766?accountid=14586,"Â  China's foreign-exchange reserves plunged by a record amount in August, underscoring the strain endured by the country's central bank as it intervened intensely to prop up the yuan.
The People's Bank of China said Monday that its reserves fell by $93.9 billion, the biggest-ever monthly drop in dollar terms and the largest in percentage terms since May 2012. The decline in China's foreign-currency reserves has accelerated, deepening a trend that illustrates the pressures of the country's slowdown, rising capital outflows and expectations for monetary tightening in the U.S.
China used its reserves to stabilize the yuan after the central bank devalued the currency on Aug. 11, a move that heightened worries about growth in the world's second-largest economy and sparked a sharp selloff across global stock markets.
At $3.56 trillion as of the end of August, the currency reserves held by the PBOC still account for nearly one-third of all holdings by central banks world-wide. But the reserves have declined since a peak of nearly $4 trillion in June 2014 as more money leaves the country
""It's a new normal,"" said Larry Hu, an economist at Macquarie Group Ltd., a Sydney-based investment bank.
The reversal raises some concerns in the U.S. government-bond market because about 40% of China's foreign-exchange reserves are held as Treasurys, according to estimates by analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. As of June, China was the world's largest investor in Treasurys, holding $1.27 trillion, according to the latest data from the Treasury Department.
Although Treasury yields remain low by historical standards, they could become elevated if selling pressure from China intensifies, some market watchers say. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
For years, companies and investors poured money into yuan assets in China, hoping to gain not only from a rapidly growing economy, but also from a currency that was set for appreciation--rising more than 30% in the past decade. Those bets have been upended both by the yuan devaluation and signs of a deepening economic slowdown .
China on Monday revised its 2014 growth rate to 7.3% from 7.4% due to a weaker-than-reported contribution from the service sector, a relatively small change but one that suggests that China's effort to meet its official growth target of about 7.5% last year was tougher than it seemed.
The declines in China's reserves contributed to a drop in central-bank holdings world-wide in the first quarter of this year to $11.43 trillion, according to the International Monetary Fund, from a peak of $11.98 trillion in mid-2014.
In a report issued last week, analysts at Deutsche Bank AG likened the fall in global reserves to ""quantitative tightening,"" saying shrinking reserves could result in higher bond yields, drive up market borrowing costs and challenge the ability of some central banks to exit from easy-money policies. The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates in the coming months, which has spurred the dollar to strengthen against many emerging-market currencies.
The reserves decline represents ""an additional source of uncertainty in the global economy,"" the bank's analysts wrote.
China's capital outflows over the past three to four quarters ""are unprecedented,"" said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan in London. ""There could potentially be even more over the coming year, as the market tries to gauge the extent of the devaluation of the Chinese currency.""
However, he said a fall in China's reserves shouldn't necessarily affect U.S. interest rates as money leaving China ""doesn't disappear."" As companies sell their yuan, they typically put their dollars in a bank, and the banks often buy U.S. government bonds with the money, Mr. Panigirtzoglou said. The strengthening dollar has also drawn more investors into Treasurys.
Some analysts say sales by China could be why Treasury prices haven't shot up even though share prices have tumbled. Between Aug. 20 and 24, the S&P 500 fell 9%, but the yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell 0.12 percentage point, a modest move given the broad market tumult.
On Friday, the 10-year yield was 2.128%, well above lows hit in February.
""The inability of Treasury yields to decline despite a sizable risk-off shock is likely linked to the sales of Treasury securities by the PBOC,"" David Woo, the head of global interest rates and currencies research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report last week.
However, China's holdings of U.S. Treasurys haven't shown signs of decline yet. As of the end of June, the country sat on a total of $1.27 trillion, up from $1.24 trillion at the end of 2014, according to the latest Treasury report. Many market observers believe the selling was partly conducted through Belgium, which is home to Chinese custodian accounts.
Also supporting Treasurys are purchases by bond funds, as investors have flocked to haven investments during the recent market volatility.
Another reason China's reserves have fallen is a push by Chinese companies and foreign companies operating in China to pay down dollar debt. China's reserves, which include a basket of global currencies and other assets, have also lost an estimated $20 billion on the changing value of currencies, with the euro, for instance, rising 2.3% in August against the dollar.
Emerging-market countries, especially in Asia, rapidly accumulated foreign reserves in a bid to protect their economies from volatile capital flows after the 1990s, outpacing most industrialized countries. In smaller economies like Thailand, reserves account for a little over 40% of gross domestic product. China is the largest holder globally, with reserves that account for about 35% of its GDP.
That ratio has been falling over the past years, but by some measures, China's reserves give it a sufficient cushion. It has sufficient reserves to pay for 22 months of imports.
Still, investors say as China turns away from an export-oriented economy to one led by consumption, its foreign-exchange reserves are bound to come under further pressure.
""Capital outflow is a big concern,"" said an official close to the central bank. That is despite the fact that Beijing still has a big war chest to defend the yuan.
Economists had estimated the drop in China's reserves in August at between $70 billion and $100 billion. Some analysts had expected outflows of as much as $150 billion.
Monday's data ""on China's foreign-exchange reserves suggest that the People's Bank is not burning through its reserves as quickly as many had believed,"" said Julian Evans-Prichard, China economist at Capital Economics.
He calculates that around $130 billion worth of funds were moved out of China in August, up from his estimate of $75 billion in outflows in July.
The central bank has resorted to two strategies to try to stem the yuan from falling further, according to people familiar with the matter. First, before the opening of daily trading, the central bank has been providing state-owned banks, which report yuan price levels to the central bank, with ""window guidance"" on a yuan price that meets the comfort levels of the PBOC.
Secondly, the central bank has been directly intervening in the currency market by buying the yuan and selling dollars to prevent the yuan from falling too much. Analysts from Deutsche Bank estimated that the central bank spent up to $50 billion on interventions on Aug. 12, 26 and 28.
The intervention also has had the effect of draining yuan funds out of the market--threatening to cause a shortage of funds at Chinese banks. As a result, the central bank in late August decided to release more than $100 billion in funds for banks to lend.

China's Top Financial Firms Get Green Light for $3 Billion IPOs; China International Capital and China Reinsurance each receive approval for their Hong Kong IPOs,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1713028765?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG--China International Capital Corp. and China Reinsurance (Group) Corp. each received approval from the Hong Kong stock exchange late Thursday to hold initial public offerings worth a combined $3 billion, people familiar with the deals said, signaling a possible revival of what has been a quiet quarter for the city's capital market.
CICC, which is China's top investment bank, and China Reinsurance, its biggest reinsurer, have yet to decide when to go public due to volatile stock markets , though they are aiming to do so this year, the people said. CICC plans to raise $1 billion, while China Re plans to raise $2 billion.
The turmoil in Chinese stocks is hurting investor appetite for initial public offerings in Hong Kong, the world's top venue for listings this year. In the third quarter, IPOs in Hong Kong have raised $1.8 billion, down significantly from $5.4 billion in the same period last year, according to the data provider Dealogic.
The two IPOs would be the first major offering since China Railway Signal & Communication Corp.'s $1.4 billion Hong Kong IPO in August. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which is weighted heavily with mainland Chinese stocks, has fallen 17% in the third quarter so far, as mainland stocks have tumbled . Those declines have weighed on investor sentiment.
On Monday, the short-haul carrier Hong Kong Airlines International Holdings Ltd. called off indefinitely a planned listing in which it had hoped to raise $500 million.
The potential listing of CICC would give its shareholders, including KKR & Co. and TPG Capital, the chance to exit their investments despite turmoil in Chinese stocks. Central Huijin Investment Ltd., the domestic investment arm of China's sovereign-wealth fund, is the largest shareholder in CICC with a 43.35% stake. Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. holds 16.35%, while TPG Capital owns 10.3% and KKR holds 10%, according to its annual report.
CICC was formed in 1995 by Morgan Stanley and China Construction Bank Corp. as China's first Sino-foreign joint-venture investment bank. Morgan Stanley sold its stake in December 2010 to a consortium that included GIC; Great Eastern Holdings Ltd., the insurer controlled by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.; and the private-equity firms KKR and TPG Capital.
CICC has played a key role in advising the Chinese government on state-owned enterprise reform and guiding the listing of the country's major overseas IPOs. It has offices in Hong Kong, New York, London and Singapore.
China Re, whose businesses include life reinsurance and wealth management, has a near monopoly on the domestic reinsurance market. China is also home to a number of smaller domestic firms and global reinsurers, including Munich Re AG, the world's biggest reinsurer by premium income, and Zurich-based reinsurer Swiss Re AG. The state-owned China Re has hired China International Capital Corp., UBS Group AG and HSBC Holdings PLC to handle the listing, according to its primary listing prospectus.

"China's Top Telecom Carriers to Sell Tower Assets to Joint Venture; Venture formed by China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom will have a valuation of $34 billion, analysts say","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1722087492?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG--China's top three telecom carriers agreed to sell their telecommunications towers to a joint venture for cash and stock, the latest effort by the country to overhaul its state-controlled companies and reduce duplicate investments in the world's largest mobile market.
China Mobile Ltd., China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd and China Telecom Corp. said late Wednesday they would transfer the assets to China Tower Corp., a joint venture the three mobile carriers formed last year.
The carriers said the move will enhance network coverage and save on capital expenditure for constructing telecom towers, which hold equipment for their mobile networks.
Analysts say the venture, which will include towers and other infrastructure, will have a valuation of 214 billion yuan, or about $34 billion. Under the deal, the carriers will pay a leasing fee for use of the towers.
Analysts said the changes would be less favorable for China Mobile, the world's biggest mobile carrier by subscribers, as smaller competitors China Unicom and China Telecom could potentially expand their network coverage quickly by sharing China Mobile's bigger pool of telecommunication assets.
After the transaction, China Mobile will own 38% of the joint venture, while China Unicom is taking a 28.1% stake and China Telecom will hold 27.9%. China Reform Corp., a state-owned asset holding company, will take a 6% stake in the joint venture and will focus on corporate governance, the companies said.
Nomura analyst Leping Huang said he expects asset-disposal gains from the transaction to boost China Unicom's 2015 earnings by 43%, compared with an 8% earnings boost for China Mobile and a 15% gain for China Telecom.
China Mobile shares rose 2.7% on Thursday. After an initial boost from the deal news, China Telecom shares lost 2.8% on the day while China Telecom slipped 0.5% as profit-taking kicked in.
The companies expect to complete the deal on Oct. 31.

"China Won't Use Military Power 'Recklessly,' Says General; Gen. Fan Changlong says China advocates peaceful resolution of territorial issues, as U.S. prepares to send ships or planes to South China Sea","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1722624608?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China won't resort to military force ""recklessly,"" even on territorial issues, and will do its utmost to avoid unexpected conflicts, one of the country's top military commanders said Saturday.
Gen. Fan Changlong, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls China's armed forces, made the remarks following indications from U.S. officials that the U.S. Navy will soon send ships or planes to patrol near China's artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea.
In his opening address to a security conference in Beijing, attended by defense officials and experts from around the world, Gen. Fan appeared to be trying to ease regional concerns that China plans to assert its claims in the area by force.
Gen. Fan said China advocated peaceful resolution of territorial issues and had resolved border disputes with several neighbors through negotiations, according to state media reports.
He also repeated China's assertion that the islands are mainly for civilian purposes, citing the recent start of operations of two new lighthouses there, those reports said.
""We will never recklessly resort to the use of force, even if it comes to issues relating to territory and sovereignty, and will do our utmost to avoid unexpected conflicts,"" the state media reports quoted Gen. Fan as saying.
He also said China would pursue expanded military cooperation with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, whose defense ministers it hosted at a forum in Beijing on Friday, according to the Associated Press.
That includes exploring the possibility of establishing hotlines and exchanging liaison officers between their militaries, the AP quoted Gen. Fan as saying.
In another apparent effort to address regional concerns, China's defense minister, Gen. Chang Wanquan, proposed on Friday conducting joint maritime drills in the South China Sea with Asean members--including some with rival territorial claims there.
Gen. Chang said China was willing to hold joint drills with Asean in 2016 on accidental encounters, search and rescue and disaster relief, according to a statement from the Defense Ministry.
China's President Xi Jinping pledged during his visit to the U.S. last month that Beijing didn't intended to ""militarize"" the islands it has built in the past year on reclaimed land around rocks and reefs in the Spratlys chain in the South China Sea.
Chinese officials haven't publicly clarified exactly what was meant by ""militarize.""
The U.S., while seeking clarification on that point, is pressing ahead with plans to send U.S. Navy ships or planes on ""freedom of navigation"" patrols within 12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands, according to U.S. officials.
Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or Unclos, countries can claim territorial waters stretching up to 12 nautical miles from their coastline, including from naturally formed islands and rocks over which they have sovereignty.
But they can make no such claims around most submerged or semi-submerged reefs, even if they have been expanded into artificial islands through reclamation, according to Unclos.
China claims ""indisputable sovereignty"" over all the islands of the South China Sea and their adjacent waters. It says it guarantees freedom of navigation but is opposed to any country using that as an excuse to violate its sovereignty.
""What on earth makes the United States think China should and will tolerate it when U.S. surface ships trespass on Chinese territory in the South China Sea?"" said a commentary published by the official Xinhua News Agency on Saturday.
The U.S. says China's activity threatens freedom of navigation in one of the world's busiest shipping routes and is intimidating rival claimants Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Brunei and the Philippines, a U.S. treaty ally.

"Morgan Stanley China Veteran Leaving to Start Private-Equity Firm; Carlos Oyarbide, the firm's managing director and operating chief in China, to join parade leaving banking for China-tech opportunities","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1746845758?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG--A veteran Morgan Stanley banker in China is leaving the Wall Street bank to start a private-equity firm focusing on China technology, according to people familiar with the matter.
Carlos Oyarbide, managing director and chief operating officer for Morgan Stanley in China, is in the early stages of setting up the firm, the people said, adding that it plans to raise around $500 million for its initial fund.
Senior bankers in the region have been jumping ship to work for Chinese tech companies or invest in the sector. In recent months, Credit Suisse Group AG's head of China technology, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s head of China health care, and the head of technology, media and telecommunications in Asia for Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit have all left for Chinese tech companies.
Mr. Oyarbide's new fund will invest in a wide swath of technology-related startups including e-commerce and financial-technology companies, one of the people said.
Mr. Oyarbide joined Morgan Stanley from Credit Suisse in 2007 to focus on the bank's China strategy and its joint-venture partnerships in the country. He reported to Wei Christianson, chief executive of China and co-CEO of Asia Pacific for the firm, with whom he also worked at Credit Suisse. At the Swiss bank, Mr. Oyarbide was responsible for banking and insurance deal-making across Asia.
Increased regulation, cost controls and lower compensation--the result of banks' need to raise returns on capital--are making jobs in investment banking less appealing for some.
By contrast, the appeal of private equity and venture capital has grown, with billions of dollars flowing into China's technology sector since investors scored huge paydays from the record $25 billion initial public offering of Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. last year. The enthusiasm for that IPO and those of other e-commerce winners like JD.com Inc. sent valuations for Chinese technology startups soaring--though China's stock-market crash this summer has slowed the deal-making.
Mr. Oyarbide's firm will be based in Hong Kong and is in the process of hiring staff, one of the people said.

"China Approves Merger of Cosco, China Shipping; The restructuring comes as China is reforming its state-owned enterprises","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1747549989?accountid=14586,"Â  China's two state shipping giants will combine their container-shipping assets among other restructuring efforts, as part of a multibillion-dollar merger to strengthen the nation's competitiveness in an industry battered by weak demand and persistent overcapacity.
China's State Cabinet on Friday approved the merger between China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co., or Cosco Group, and China Shipping (Group) Co., according to statement posted on the website of China's state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, ending years of speculation among analysts that the government would ultimately combine the two groups to boost efficiency.
The planned merger comes as the nation attempts to reform its state-owned businesses , in the hopes of creating bigger and stronger national champions that can better compete abroad
As reported by The Wall Street Journal, the merger involves combining Cosco and China Shipping's listed container-shipping operations to create the world's fourth-biggest container-shipping line, after AP Moller Maersk Group, Mediterranean Shipping Co. and France's CMA CGM SA.
China Cosco Holdings Co. said in an exchange filling that it plans to consolidate the container-shipping operations with its state-backed rival China Shipping Container Lines Co. through acquiring a total of 33 container-shipping related units and affiliates from CSCL for 1.14 billion yuan ($177 million) and leasing its container ships.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed flagship of Cosco Group plans to sell all its dry-bulk shipping businesses to its state parent for 6.77 billion yuan.
The asset restructuring also covers the two groups' ports and oil-tanker-shipping operations. Cosco Pacific Ltd., the Hong Kong-listed port-operating arm of Cosco Group will pay 7.63 billion yuan to buy the port-operating business of China Shipping (Group) Co. Cosco Pacific also plans to sell its container leasing business--Florens Container Holdings Ltd.--to a unit of China Shipping Container Lines Co. for 7.78 billion yuan.
China Shipping Development Co., the oil-and-bulk-shipping unit of China Shipping Group, also plans to buy the oil shipping business from China Cosco Group, it said.
The slew of deals comes as the two shipping groups seek to reorganize their businesses, with Cosco Group focusing on the container-shipping sector and China Shipping Group becoming a shipping financial-service provider, it added.
The merger would prevent the two shipping groups from competing against each other at home and abroad, in an industry swamped with oversupply and depressed freight rates. China's economic slowdown has also hurt the prices of commodities, such as oil, iron ore and coal, damaging the shipping firms' profitability.
Parts of the deal, such as the merger of the container-shipping businesses, are subject to regulatory approvals around the world, including the U.S. and Canada.
China Cosco has been particularly hard hit by the prolonged industrywide woes in part due to its ill-timed expansion by chartering high-cost ships during the height of the commodities boom, which left the company with high debts and reduced operational efficiency.
The shipping conglomerate only managed to return to profitability in 2013 after two straight years of steep losses, because of one-time gains from asset sales to Cosco's state-owned parent.
It recorded a first-half net profit of 1.90 billion yuan ($295.1 million) in 2015, helped by nearly four billion yuan worth of government subsidies.
""Going after market share is the best strategy at a time when the shipping industry is going through one its longest downturns,"" said Basil Karatzas, a New York-based shipping adviser who works with some of the world's biggest players. ""This merger looks to be full-fledged across all units, but this adds to its complexity. Only time will tell if all these deals go through smoothly and bring down costs or [if] it's just a case of two state giants becoming an even bigger behemoth.""
Meanwhile, the global container-shipping industry has been mired in a prolonged period of meager profitability even while striving to cut costs and run its businesses under bigger and closer shipping alliances. On Monday, French shipping company CMA CGMentered a deal to buy Singapore's Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. for about $2.4 billion, in a deal that would provide some consolidation in the container-shipping fleet.
Beijing is also pushing two other state shipping companies, China Merchants Energy Shipping Co. and Sinotrans & CSC Holdings Co., to merge some units, though talks are at an early stage. The Chinese government earlier this year merged two of its biggest train makers --China CNR Corp. and CSR Corp.-into CRRC Corp.--in a bid to strengthen their competitiveness when bidding for overseas contracts.

"In China Shipping Revamp, This Oil Tanker Operator Is Slickest; China Shipping Development should stand out as China reorganizes its shipping industry","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1748548885?accountid=14586,"Â  The megamerger between two Chinese state shipping giants was born out of necessity in a dismal market. But there is one bright spot--a listed tanker company called China Shipping Development.
China's government approved the merger between state-owned Cosco Group and China Shipping Group Friday that will create the fourth-biggest container shipper in the world. A reshuffle will leave their several listed businesses into neatly organized units, which should make it easier for investors to discern winners from losers.
Most of them, it turns out, are losers. Almost all of the stocks within the groups plunged Monday as they resumed trading after a four-month hiatus. This is partly because the broader market has declined since August, when the stocks were suspended pending a deal announcement. Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks have fallen nearly 20% over the period. A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the world's largest container shipper, has dropped 23% in Copenhagen.
One stock, however, stands out as winner through the restructuring--China Shipping Development.
It will convert into a pure-play tanker company after swapping its unprofitable dry bulk assets with Cosco Group in return for the latter's profitable oil tanker and LNG vessel business.
The asset swap would be earnings accretive. The dry bulk business it gets rid of lost $99 million in the first nine months this year while the tanker business it bought made a profit of similar size.
Transporting oil and gas has been a more promising business compared with shipping iron ore and coal. China's crude oil imports rose 9% from last year in the first 11 months of this year, amid slumping oil prices. China's coal imports dropped 30%, while its iron ore imports were flat.
Plummeting crude prices may get some worried about the oil shipping business. But an oil-price plunge caused by too much supply isn't bad news for tanker operators. Oil demand is what matters for tanker usage, and it is holding up just fine. Dry bulk rates have plunged nearly 80% in the past two years while crude-oil tanker rates have gone up 16%.
In China's shipping consolidation, the oil shipper is the one that floats on top.

"China Orient Restructures, Paving Way for Bad-Bank IPO; China Orient will establish a joint-stock company by selling a stake to China's National Social Security Fund","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2015,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1752568964?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--The last of China's big holders of bad bank debt unveiled plans to restructure its state ownership and make it eventually eligible to go public, amid growing investor skepticism over the country's growing pile of sour loans.
China Orient Asset Management Corp., one of the nation's four state-run debt-clearing firms known as China's bad banks, said Thursday that it would establish a joint-stock company by selling a stake to China's National Social Security Fund, a move that paves the way for its initial public offering.
China Orient, which is now wholly owned by the nation's finance ministry, said that the state fund will hold 2% of its shares and that the restructuring is expected to be finished by the first quarter of 2016. After that, it plans to sell a 15% to 20% stake to strategic investors both at home and abroad.
""We hope that we can seize an opportunity to go public by the end of 2017,"" Liang Senlin, the head of the firm's restructuring work, said Thursday. He said that the exact timing depends on the market and the company's business development.
China set up four bad banks -- formally known as asset-management companies -- in 1999 to shoulder bad loans from the nation's biggest four banks, saving the lenders from insolvency. The four bad banks make money by buying soured assets at a discount and then restructuring the companies to return them to profitability or by recovering cash from the borrowers.
The four companies prospered as China's economic growth took off over the following years. Two of the bad banks -- China Cinda Asset Management Co. and China Huarong Asset Management Co. -- have listed their shares in Hong Kong and raised around $4.8 billion to fund their purchases of soured debt and other business expansion. China Great Wall Asset Management Corp. unveiled its restructuring plan last week.
As the Chinese economy loses momentum, the four bad banks are now trying to profit from a new round of nonperforming-loan growth. Bad loans at China's commercial banks have risen for four years in a row and stood at 1.19 trillion yuan ($183.27 billion) at the end of September, according to the latest data available from the banking regulator.
But many investors now worry about the bad banks' abilities to turn around bad loans in a time of slowing economic growth . Shares of both Cinda and Huarong traded below their IPO prices on Thursday.
Zhang Xin, a vice president of China Orient, said the firm sees a rise of business opportunities amid an economic downturn, but the pressure to turn distressed assets into profit is also increasing. Bad banks now face profitability pressure from their shareholders and increasing funding costs because they can no longer take cheap, long-term cash from the government after restructuring into commercial companies, she said.
Increasingly the bad banks are starting to offer other types of financial services, including banking, insurance, trust and financial leasing.
Also on Thursday, China Orient said it would invest around 18 billion yuan to hold 50.29% stake in Bank of Dalian Co., one of the country's smaller regional lenders based in the northeast port city, as well as the lender's bad-loan package with a face value of 10 billion yuan.
The deal has received approval from local banking regulator and is expected to boost the firm's client base and expand bancassurance channels for its insurance subsidiary, said its executives.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 400 points Thursday as steep falls in Chinese equities spilled over to global markets
Thursday's selloff came after the People's Bank of China made its largest downward adjustment to the yuan since August. The country's stock market fell more than 7% amid concerns about capital flight from the Asian giant, and China's stock markets stopped trading after only 30 minutes, ending the shortest trading day in their history after the newly installed mechanism to limit volatility was triggered for the second time this week .
The Dow industrials dropped 392.41 points, or 2.3%, to 16514.10. The S&P 500 dropped 2.4%. Both indexes are off to their worst starts ever, with the Dow down 5.2% over the first four trading days of the year and the S&P 500 off 4.9%.
The Nasdaq Composite, which declined 3% on Thursday, is having its worst start since 2000, down 6.4%.
Traders said while they prepared for a frenzied trading session there was relatively little urgency in the selling.
""U.S. markets are getting wrapped in with global markets, and rightfully so, but so far there isn't massive panic selling here,"" said Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners.
Stock market declines worsened in afternoon trading as investors braced for another potential drop in Chinese stock markets on Friday. Traders said many investors made late-day bets against the S&P 500 in case there is additional turmoil in China on Friday that again spills over to U.S. markets.
Markets around the globe fell on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index each lost more than 2%.
The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 2.2% after earlier declining as much as 3.6%.

China said later Thursday that it would suspend its new circuit breaker mechanism that has been at the center of its stock market unrest.
The fears about China spread to commodity markets, sending U.S.-traded oil down 2.1% to $33.27 a barrel amid concerns about future demand from the world's second-largest consumer of crude. Base metals from copper to nickel also fell.
The rush to safe-haven investments, such as gold and U.S. government bonds, also picked up in afternoon trading. Gold ticked up 1.4% to $1107.70 an ounce. The yield on the U.S.10-year Treasury fell to 2.153% from 2.177% on Wednesday. Yields fall as prices rise.
In currencies, the onshore Chinese yuan broke to its lowest level since 2011 against the dollar. The euro gained against the dollar, while the dollar was down against the safe-haven yen.
China has dominated the stock market in 2016 thus far. Markets opened on Monday to a weaker yuan and lackluster manufacturing data, and sharp declines in Chinese stocks have prompted authorities to halt trading on two separate occasions this week, sending ripples throughout global markets.
""The interpretation is that the currency market manipulation tells you the economy is doing worse than expected,"" said Johan Javeus, chief strategist at SEB Group. ""Maybe growth is slowing faster, and that's something we're concerned about outside China.""
Analysts are also concerned that a devaluation of the yuan will push neighboring countries to lower their currencies, dampening Chinese demand for imports and further hurting confidence in the country's economy.
Investors spent Thursday debating whether the falls in Chinese markets--which haven't always acted as an accurate proxy for the underling economy--will continue and lead to further losses in global markets.
Market Talk
Stable Yuan, Oil Prices Needed for Markets to Steady Falling oil prices, tensions in the Middle East and an acceleration in the weakening of China's currency means ""overall there's a perfect storm going on at the moment,"" says Ewen Cameron Watt, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. Two days of 7% falls in mainland Chinese stocks alone wouldn't be enough to trigger turmoil across global markets without the yuan's depreciation and these other issues, he says. For investors to get comfortable buying stocks again, the rate of the yuan's weakening would have to slow and oil prices would need to stabilize, he adds. (christopher.whittall@wsj.com)

Some investors shrugged off the Chinese declines, saying they were likely magnified by the threat of an expiring ban on selling by large shareholders.
Nicholas Melhuish, head of global equities at Amundi Asset Management, said he expects a tough first half of the year with a lot of volatility. Many of the issues that plagued global equity markets last year, including shifts in the Chinese economy, trouble in emerging markets and a slowly tightening Federal Reserve, have already surfaced in the first sessions of the year.
""It could be quite a volatile year with a lot of issues lingering from last year brought to the fore in the first week,"" Mr. Melhuish said.

China Defends Test Flights in South China Sea Area; Vietnam accused China of violating international rules on aviation safety,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1755482562?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China defended recent test flights to a disputed reef in the South China Sea as sovereign activity, rebuffing Vietnam's criticisms that the flights were unannounced and contravened international rules on aviation safety.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Monday that China's aviation regulator had notified its Vietnamese counterpart about the flights Dec. 28 and that a follow-up technical briefing with diplomats occurred two days later. Mr. Hong said, contrary to Vietnam's assertions, that the flights are exempt from international civil-aviation rules because they were ""totally within China's sovereignty.""
China's test flights in the first week of January to a newly built airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef are the latest actions to raise tensions in the South China Sea. The reef is part of the Spratly Islands chain that is claimed by Beijing and Hanoi, as well as four other governments. The building of the airstrip and other facilities on the islands have fanned concerns China is increasing military control of strategic sea lanes vital for international shipping.
In addition to lodging diplomatic protests, Hanoi filed a complaint with the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization, accusing Beijing of flying planes without warning into an air-traffic control area supervised by Vietnamese aviation authorities.
Vietnam is mandated by ICAO to supervise international air traffic through a large portion of the South China Sea known as the Ho Chi Minh City Flight Information Region. Vietnamese aviation authorities said they recorded 46 instances of Chinese planes flying without warning through that area in the first week of January, including the test flights to Fiery Cross Reef.
Speaking at a regular news briefing, Mr. Hong denied that the test flights have affected regional safety. He said that instead, they show Fiery Cross Reef is ready to handle civil-aviation operations that can benefit maritime search-and-rescue and other public services in the area.
He dismissed Vietnam's protest to ICAO, saying the U.N. agency had no jurisdiction over the matter. He said the ""Chinese government decided to designate the relevant flight activities into state aviation activities, to be conducted with civil aircraft.""
Spokesmen for Vietnam's civil-aviation regulator and ICAO didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Aviation experts said the dispute centers on whether China's test flights--carried out using state-owned commercial airliners--qualified as ""state flights.""
""It would be easy for a country to claim a state flight when it was not, and equally easy for other states to claim that the ICAO convention was being abused,"" said David Learmount, a consulting editor at Flightglobal, an aviation industry publication.
The Convention on International Civil Aviation, of which China is a signatory, said its rules don't apply to ""state aircraft,"" which are defined as ""aircraft used in military, customs and police services."" The convention said signatory states will show ""due regard for the safety of navigation of civil aircraft"" when issuing regulations for their state aircraft.

China Positions Missiles on Disputed South China Sea Island; Deployment came as President Obama met with leaders of nations embroiled in territorial disputes with China,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1765484253?accountid=14586,"Â 
China has positioned surface-to-air missiles on a disputed island in the South China Sea, a U.S. official said Tuesday, one of the most aggressive military steps so far by Beijing in a burgeoning standoff with Washington involving warplanes , naval destroyers and increasingly frequent public warnings.
The placement and timing of the missile deployment carried significance, coming as U.S. President Barack Obama met in California on Tuesday with leaders of Southeast Asian nations embroiled in territorial disputes with China. The surface-to-air weapons were detected on Woody Island, part of the Paracel Islands chain just east of Vietnam, which is one of the nations represented at the summit in California.
Vietnam claims Woody Island, known as Yongxing in Chinese, as does Taiwan. Located southeast of China's island province of Hainan, Woody Island is home to China's only large operational airfield in the South China Sea, according to Chinese media.
Chinese officials Wednesday neither confirmed nor denied the claims--made by both U.S. and Taiwanese officials--that Beijing had positioned the missiles on Woody Island, though Foreign Minister Wang Yi defended Beijing's placement of ""limited and necessary defensive facilities"" on its sovereign territory.
Such deployments are ""completely in accordance with the rights of self-defense accorded to any sovereign nation under international law,"" Mr. Wang said at a news briefing. Asked about the missile placements, he said: ""I'm afraid that it's a way for some Western media to create news,"" according to a recording of his comments.
China's Defense Ministry echoed Mr. Wang's comments, decrying what it called Western media efforts to play up the ""Chinese threat."" In a faxed statement, the ministry said the Paracels are Chinese territory and that ""maritime and aerial defensive deployments on China's relevant islands and reefs have existed for many years.""
U.S. and Taiwanese officials didn't elaborate on the type of missiles or the scale of their deployment on Woody Island, though military experts say the weapons appear to be China's HQ-9, a medium- to long-range, active radar-homing air-defense missile system.
U.S. officials expressed concern around the introduction of advanced military hardware to a burgeoning standoff with the U.S. and some Southeast Asian governments.
In May, U.S. officials said a pair of motorized artillery pieces were detected on Johnson Reef, part of the nearby Spratly Islands chain, south of the Paracels. The presence of missiles represents a further step toward militarization, as the U.S. has flown planes and sailed boats near the islands to challenge China's maritime and territorial claims.
Adm. Harry Harris Jr., the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday that he didn't have confirmation of the missile deployment but that if true ""it could be an indication of militarization of the South China Sea in ways that the president of China, President Xi [Jinping], said he would not do.""
Mr. Xi, on a visit to the U.S. in September, made a public pledge not to ""militarize"" islands that China was building in the Spratlys.
At a regular news briefing Tuesday, ahead of the news of the missile deployment, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei responded to a question about Beijing's facilities in the South China Sea by saying that China has the right to defend itself, but that won't disrupt freedom of navigation.
""We will deploy a necessary amount of national defense facilities,"" said Mr. Hong. ""Self-preservation and self-defense are rights enjoyed by China under international law. This will not affect the right of freedom of navigation and overflight that all countries are entitled to under international law.""
On Tuesday night in Washington, Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Bill Urban said in an emailed statement that Washington called for a peaceful settlement of differences. ""The United States continues to call on all claimants to halt land reclamation, construction and militarization of features in the South China Sea,"" he said.
The presence of the missiles was reported Tuesday by Fox News.
Tensions over China's claims in the South China Sea have risen over the past year or so as Beijing embarked on an project to reclaim land and build artificial islands in disputed waters in the Spratlys. Beijing conducted test flights to a new airstrip there last month , using civilian aircraft. It has also reclaimed land in the Paracels to enlarge Woody Island as well as others nearby.
The U.S. has expressed concern about freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and has been testing China's expansive claims by sailing ships and sending planes into the waters and airspace around islands and other formations controlled by Beijing. Last month, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur sailed within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island, which is part of the Paracels chain, about 100 miles from the island where China deployed the missiles.
Some analysts said the missile deployment on Woody Island appears to be a response to the recent U.S. operations, though others believe Beijing had intended to bolster its military presence regardless. ""I think China has planned these deployments for some time,"" said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
""China has recently built hardened shelters for fighter aircraft on Woody Island. It isn't surprising that they are deploying SAMs to defend them,"" she said.
At the two-day summit between U.S. and Southeast Asian leaders in Rancho Mirage, Calif., Mr. Obama promised to help allies in the region counter China's expanding claims.
""Freedom of navigation must be upheld and lawful commerce should not be impeded,"" Mr. Obama said. ""We will continue to help our allies and partners strengthen their maritime capabilities.""
The summit took place amid rising concerns over territorial disputes and maritime security in the South China Sea and growing tensions between Washington and Beijing over how to respond to recent aggression from North Korea , which conducted its fourth nuclear test and launched a rocket using ballistic missile technology.
The White House said later this spring, Mr. Obama will visit Vietnam, one of the 10 Southeast Asian countries that is part of the group known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.

China Appears to Have Built Radar Facilities on Disputed South China Sea Islands; Satellite images suggest Beijing has been building new facilities on the South China Sea's Spratlys,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1767234579?accountid=14586,"Â 
BEIJING--Fresh satellite imagery suggests that China has been building radar facilities on some of the artificial islands it built in the South China Sea , in a move that would improve its military power in the region, a U.S.-based think tank said Tuesday.
The report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on the radar installations in the Spratly Islands comes days after U.S. and Taiwanese officials said Beijing had placed surface-to-air missiles on the Paracels chain , north of the Spratlys. The deployment prompted comments from Washington that China appears to be militarizing a region already
racked by territorial tensions .
The report also coincided with the start of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's three-day visit to the U.S., where he is expected to discuss the South China Sea disputes and North Korea's nuclear program, among other issues.
In its report , Washington-based CSIS said China's new radar installations in the Spratlys ""could significantly change the operational landscape in the South China Sea.""
Citing satellite imagery dated between late January and mid-February, CSIS said China appeared to have installed radar towers on four artificial islands in the Spratlys that Beijing steadily expanded over the past two years through land reclamation.
Most of the radar facilities appear to have been built in ""the latter half of 2015, and a few are still under construction,"" said Greg Poling, director of CSIS's Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. It wasn't clear if any were in operation, he added.
The facilities include what appears to be a ""high-frequency radar installation"" on Cuarteron Reef that would ""significantly bolster China's ability to monitor surface and air traffic across the southern portion of the South China Sea,"" CSIS said. Along with Beijing's construction of new runways and air-defense capabilities in the area, they ""speak to a long-term anti-access strategy by China--one that would see it establish effective control over the sea and airspace throughout the South China Sea,"" it said.
China's construction work on the Spratlys has been at the center of an escalating spat between Beijing and Washington since last year. U.S. officials say Beijing is militarizing the region as a way to bolster its maritime claims, while China has defended its work as defensive and legitimate acts.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters that she wasn't aware of the specifics regarding the reported radar installations, but reiterated Beijing's position that the artificial islands are ""indisputably China's territory,"" and the ""necessary and limited deployment of defensive facilities is the exercise of China's self-preservation rights, which are granted by international law.""
China's Defense Ministry said that Beijing's construction work mainly served civilian purposes, and accused its critics of ""deliberately creating issues and spreading tensions.""
White House spokesman Josh Earnest, when asked about the CSIS report at a news briefing, said the U.S. was ""going to continue to evaluate the situation in the South China Sea,"" while urging China and other countries in the area to commit to ""not building up a military presence on those features that are the subject of competing claims.""
The two sides exchanged similar barbs over the past week over the Chinese missile deployment on Woody Island, a part of the Paracels and home to a large airfield that has hosted drills by Chinese fighter jets.
U.S. officials said the Chinese appeared to be going back on President Xi Jinping's pledge, made while visiting the White House last year, to refrain from militarizing man-made islands in the South China Sea.
Adm. Harry Harris, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, said he wasn't surprised the Chinese had placed surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island.
""In my opinion, China is clearly militarizing the South China Sea and you'd have to believe in the flat Earth to think otherwise,"" said Adm. Harris during a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington.
Adm. Harris acknowledged that Beijing has also placed radars and other military gear on some of the islands and built runways.
Chinese officials countered by saying the U.S. were responsible for militarizing the region when it started testing China's posture late last year with military patrols near islands controlled by Beijing.
Analysts say the missiles by themselves pose little threat to the balance of power in the South China Sea, where six governments have overlapping territorial claims. China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia have for decades stationed military hardware and personnel on the islands and reefs they control. U.S. warships and surveillance aircraft also pass through the area regularly.

Yet despite all the drama surrounding Mr. Xiao's tenure at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shanghai Composite Index didn't perform badly under his nearly three-year watch, generating a return of 27.7%, according to data from FactSet.
That's a better track record for the index than under Mr. Xiao's immediate predecessor, Guo Shuqing, who saw Shanghai's benchmark rack up losses over his two-year tenure. The index performed its worst--a 15.38% loss--under Zhou Xiaochuan, now the governor of the People's Bank of China, who cracked down on illegal activity and ushered in numerous reforms.
A regulator's job isn't to maximize stock market returns, but to maintain confidence in the market. Chinese regulators have borrowed strategies from the U.S. and other markets as they watched over young and immature stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Some were more hands-on than others in efforts to stamp out market malfeasance, but political pressure has been a constant factor.
Here's a look at the performance of the Shanghai benchmark during the tenures of the chairmen of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, including the first day of Liu Shiyu who was just this past weekend tapped to be the new chairman.
One caveat: The data assume dividends were reinvested, which enhances the performance seen under some chairmen, particularly in the early, volatile years. But the snapshot of the index values alone underscores the challenge of wrestling the Shanghai market.

China Economic Planner Says Slowdown Isn't Stunting Global Growth; Head of Beijing's top economic-planning agency dismisses predictions of a hard landing,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1770928568?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--The head of China's top economic-planning agency Sunday rejected suggestions the Chinese slowdown was dragging on global growth and markets, saying the world's second largest economy continues to be a source of demand and vitality.
National Development and Reform Commission chief Xu Shaoshi cited the 6.9% growth the economy clocked last year and the high volume of commodities it is importing as among the contributions China is making to global economic health. Even as the government is lowering its growth target for the slowing economy, Mr. Xu ruled out any likelihood of a hard landing.
Mr. Xu's defense is one of the more forceful from a senior official since China's slowdown, the surprise shifts in the central bank's currency policy, and the government's botched handling of a stock market meltdown began reverberating through global markets last year.

""China is fully capable of keeping economic growth within a reasonable range,"" Mr. Xu said Sunday at a news conference on the sidelines of China's annual legislative session. ""All predictions of a hard landing will definitely fail.""
Worries about China's deceleration--and how the Chinese leadership is managing it--have dominated policy and business discussions across the globe. At a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies last month in Shanghai, Chinese leaders strove to reassure major trading partners that Beijing wouldn't devalue the yuan as it navigates the economic tangle.
The International Monetary Fund, along with other institutions, investors and analysts, has said the decelerating Chinese economy and its rebalancing away from smokestack industries and toward services will continue to drag global growth this year and next.
Mr. Xu, turning the tables, singled out weak global growth as exacerbating China's slowdown. He pointed to a clutch of China data, including rising household income and mild inflation, as evidence of economic strength. He also said that plans to restructure heavy industries beset by overcapacity won't result in large-scale unemployment.
""There definitely won't be a second large wave of layoffs,"" he said, referring to wrenching economic reforms in the 1990s that economists estimate laid off about 20 million workers over 1996 and 1997 alone.
This time around, Beijing has outlined plans to cut 1.8 million workers from steel and coal plants over the next five years. The government policy program for this year , unveiled at the National People's Congress opening on Saturday, outlined the restructuring but didn't include an estimate for numbers of workers to be retrenched.
One reason layoffs have yet to soar is that many companies sometimes slash salaries and work days of employees, but retain them on payrolls--something Mr. Xu supported, despite economists saying it ultimately prolongs the economy's transition.
Defending China's economic leadership, Mr. Xu pointed to rising volumes of China's commodity imports, even as their overall value fell last year given sagging prices for commodities world-wide. Shipments of iron ore, for instance, rose 11% by tonnage, but fell 25% by value, according to customs data.
""As the world's second-largest economy, China's growth will have a spillover effect on the global economic recovery,"" Mr. Xu said. ""Still, I disagree with the statement that China is dragging on the global economy.""
Mr. Xu cited data from the IMF and the World Bank showing that China accounts for about 15% of global economic output. The World Bank in January estimated that a decline of 1 percentage point in China's growth triggers a 1.2 percentage point fall in the growth of commodity-exporting economies such as Australia and Brazil.
Concerning the recent bouts of market volatility in the U.S. and Europe, Mr. Xu played down China's role. He pointed to a week-long period last month when he said global markets were volatile, while China went on its Lunar New Year vacation. ""They have overestimated China's ability,"" he said. ""We don't have so large a spillover effect.""

World News -- China's World: China's 'Great Wall of Sand' Upstages U.S.,"Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780387201?accountid=14586,"Â  SHANGHAI -- Armed only with a set of revolving teeth, the Tian Jing Hao, Asia's largest dredger, has pulled off a stunning naval upset.
Under the noses of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, this Chinese vessel led a civilian armada that built almost 3,000 acres of land atop submerged reefs in the Spratly Islands, altering a strategic balance that has held since the great naval battles of World War II established U.S. primacy in the western Pacific.
The construction began shortly after the Philippines challenged China's territorial claims in the South China Sea by filing a case at a United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague in January 2014. Now, on the eve of a verdict, China has achieved its objective: a new geography in the world's busiest commercial waterway where China's claims overlap with those of five neighbors.
However the five judges decide the case, China has permanently altered facts on the ground in its favor.
The seven Spratly outcrops on which it has built runways, docks, radar and other facilities give China the ability to project new force in its contest with the U.S. for regional mastery.
Possession, after all, is nine-tenths of the law. And China's island-building may not have ended. The Pentagon fears dredgers might be planning fresh construction on Scarborough Shoal, which would give the People's Liberation Army a jumping-off point just 140 miles from Manila. It's bracing, too, for China to declare an Air Defense Identification Zone over the entire South China Sea, which China could enforce from artificial islands. China has pledged to ignore the tribunal's findings.
China's land reclamation won't change the legal case in The Hague; semi-submerged reefs don't become islands even if you build on them. Nevertheless, slow-moving Chinese dredgers have outmaneuvered the world's most powerful navy. China's political leaders calculated, correctly, that America wouldn't risk war over a bunch of uninhabited rocks and reefs to stop them.
Yet what the U.S. Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Harry Harris Jr., has termed China's ""Great Wall of Sand"" has raised the risk of future conflicts.
A regional arms race is under way. China's smaller neighbors feel bullied and threatened by what has become the sharp end of Beijing's diplomacy: powerful cutters attached to the dredgers that have unleashed environmental devastation, hacking to bits pristine coral and threatening marine life.
Moreover, China's moves to balloon specks of coral into military-capable platforms have helped spawn new networks aimed at blunting Chinese advances.
On Tuesday, China responded angrily to a declaration by foreign ministers of the Group of Seven urging a halt to ""intimidating, coercive or provocative actions"" in the South China Sea and East China Sea.
In another sign of how Chinese assertiveness is bringing together old adversaries, this week two Japanese warships and a submarine are visiting the Philippines naval base of Subic Bay, as thousands of American, Australian and Philippine forces conduct drills.
The so-called cutter suction dredgers -- the debris they create is vacuumed up underwater and showered onto the reefs through long pipes -- have created a dilemma for U.S. President Barack Obama.
Confronting China in the Spratlys by, for instance, trying to chase away dredgers and their naval protection not only risks war but could derail cooperation with Beijing on crucial issues like climate change or North Korea.
White House caution, though, has left U.S. naval commanders frustrated. Belatedly, they've got the political go-ahead to sail warships close to the man-made islands in ""freedom-of-navigation"" exercises.
These sail-by missions, however, won't stop the rapid militarization of a sea that carries $5 trillion in global commerce each year. China has recently positioned surface-to-air missile batteries on the Paracels, another set of South China Sea islands. Beijing, in turn, accuses the U.S. of militarizing the region with its patrols.
Meanwhile, the Tian Jing Hao dredger (its name translates as ""Heavenly Whale"") and its sister ships are moving on.
The reclamation work in the Spratlys was merely the first phase of an epic construction spree that has become Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature initiative: the Maritime Silk Road project to build a string of ports and industrial zones from East Asia to Europe via Africa and the Middle East.
This, it seems, is how China intends to reshape the ""Pacific Century"" -- one gigantic shovel from the seabed at a time.
This month, Chinese state media announced a ceremony to mark the crowning achievement of the Spratlys dredging exercise: a 55-meter lighthouse on Subi Reef.
At night, its lantern will cast a beam of light 22 nautical miles across a vast stretch of water that Beijing, increasingly, looks upon as a Chinese lake.

"U.S. Agency Sees Increased Risks From Wells Fargo, Three Chinese Banks; Office of Financial Research cites Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank as increasing systemic importance","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780578628?accountid=14586,"Â  WASHINGTON--Three of the largest Chinese banks and one U.S. bank--Wells Fargo & Co.--increased the risk they pose to the global financial system, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Office of Financial Research.
The agency said new data show the banks expanded their systemic risk profile between 2013 and 2014.
The Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China substantially increased their systemic importance, based on an updated analysis by the agency, while the China Construction Bank was added for the first time. ""The increase in Chinese banks' scores is consistent with other indicators of rising systemic risk in China,"" the report said.
U.K. and U.S. banks have $531 billion and $148 billion, respectively, in exposure to financial institutions in China and Hong Kong.
The research office, an arm of the Treasury Department, analyzed data on 30 institutions world-wide to assess their systemic importance and score each bank across five categories: size, interconnectedness with other banks, substitutability, complexity and cross-jurisdictional activity. And it came up with an interactive chart that shows changes from 2013 to 2014.
Regulators use the data to calculate how much extra capital large banks must hold. To calculate systemic importance scores, the OFR used public information from the individual banks' websites.
Institutions that are labeled as systemically important are those whose failure could pose a threat to the financial system. There are currently 30 global banks that meet that definition, including eight U.S. firms.
The report found that U.S. institutions such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. remain among the most systemically important financial institutions in the world because they are so highly interconnected and there are few substitutes for the financial services they offer.
Overall, U.S. banks' systemic importance changed little in 2014, with the exception of Wells Fargo, the nation's third largest bank, with $1.8 trillion in assets. Wells Fargo increased its score because of an increase in total exposures and underwriting activity, among other factors.
By contrast, three European banks--Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and France's CrÃ©dit Agricole--reduced their systemic importance by 10%.

There certainly is room for debate about the nature of China's paradoxical ideological-political development, but the important thing is to avoid demonizing it and instead maintain a strong U.S. military-diplomatic position in the Pacific, which is needed not only to serve U.S. security interests but also to help President Xi refute the ever-rambunctious demands of the radical Maoist elements in his party and in Chinese universities.

"Calls for China to Respect Maritime-Claim Ruling Grow Louder; China risks isolating itself by continuing its actions in the South China Sea, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter says","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1793695820?accountid=14586,"Â  SINGAPORE--Western officials ramped up calls for China to respect an impending ruling from a Hague tribunal on Beijing's broad maritime claim to the South China Sea, even though Chinese authorities have boycotted the proceedings and called them illegal.
U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said China risked erecting a ""Great Wall of self-isolation"" by taking expansive and unprecedented actions in the South China Sea. He called on China to stop isolating itself and join other Asian nations and the U.S. in building a partnership based on principle and international law. ( More: Beijing Hits Back at U.S. Over South China Sea Comments )
Mr. Carter's comments--made at a high-profile security conference in Singapore known as the Shangri-La Dialogue--come ahead of a ruling in the coming weeks from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, where the Philippines has challenged China's expansive maritime claim to the South China Sea under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

* Opinion: Avoiding a Military Showdown in the South China Sea
The U.S. views the ruling as binding, regardless of its outcome, Mr. Carter told several Asian leaders during side meetings at the Singapore conference.
""Only when everyone plays by the same rules can we avoid the mistakes of the past, like when countries challenged one another in contests of strength and will, with disastrous consequences for the region,"" Mr. Carter said in his keynote speech Saturday.
The tribunal's judgment presents an opportunity for renewed diplomacy aimed at lowering tensions in the South China Sea, according to Mr. Carter. ""All of us should come together to ensure this opportunity is realized,"" he said.
But the ruling could also inflame tensions in an already complicated area.
China has refused to negotiate terms for the South China Sea on the basis of the judgment, a position reiterated Saturday by a senior Chinese military official, who called the arbitration tribunal ""illegitimate.""
Instead of third-party arbitration, Chinese officials have long favored bilateral talks with rival claimants to the South China Sea, all of which are dwarfed by China militarily and economically. China has blamed the U.S. for hyping up the dispute over the waters as a pretext for advancing its military footprint in the region.
The notion that Beijing is cutting itself off from the rules-based international order ""is a fabricated concept that doesn't confirm to reality, and its purpose is to isolate China,"" said Rear Adm. Guan Youfei, director of the Chinese military's foreign affairs office.
China has spent years extending de facto control over parts of the South China Sea by installing artificial harbors, airfields and surveillance systems on uninhabited land formations, according to a recent Pentagon report , which accused China of using ""coercive tactics short of armed conflict."" Already, Beijing has signaled that it plans to reject the tribunal's decision, expected by many security analysts to be favorable to Manila.
Top Asian defense officials--including from Japan, South Korea and Malaysia--used their speeches at the Shangri-La Dialogue to urge respect for international laws and norms, though only Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani specifically mentioned China.
""Every judgment or decision made by related courts must be fully observed by all claimants in accordance with relevant international law,"" Mr. Nakatani said, adding that Beijing's land-reclamation program in the South China Sea has alarmed neighboring countries.
Governments with claims to the sea await the ruling in the coming weeks.
""The defining moment will be when they issue this ruling,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said on the sidelines of the conference.
""If China defies it, then the world is going to have a chance to do with China what we didn't do with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" Mr. Graham said. ""We learned our lesson on what happens when you let [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad cross a red line, you let Putin dismember a neighbor, and he really doesn't pay a price. That moment is coming to Asia.""
Mr. Carter has pursued a dual-track approach. He has hit out at China for its actions in the South China Sea, calling them provocative and destabilizing, and continued sending American planes and ships across the sea in ""freedom of navigation operations"" designed to ensure the waters remain open to all.
On Saturday, he warned that any further encroachment by China on Scarborough Shoal, a disputed clump of rocks, sandbars and coral reefs about 120 nautical miles from the Philippines, would raise tensions and result in actions by the U.S. and other countries in the region. He didn't make clear what those actions would be.
At the same time, Mr. Carter has cheered U.S. cooperation with China, vowing to deepen ties with Beijing and inviting the Chinese military to participate in high-profile Rim of the Pacific international naval exercises later this year .
During those exercises, the U.S. and China will sail together from Guam to Hawaii, conducting seven exercise events, including a practice of search-and-rescue capabilities.
Adm. Harry Harris Jr., commander of U.S. Pacific Command, described the U.S. approach to China in a briefing Saturday.
""We want to cooperate with China in all domains as much as possible,"" Adm. Harris said. ""I have a view of: 'cooperation where we can, but we have to confront them if we must.' We have to operate from a position of strength against all outcomes.""
Mr. Carter has faced criticism in some parts for not responding more aggressively to China's moves in the disputed waters. Beijing asserts sovereignty over almost the entire sea, a critical trade and fishing hub, ignoring overlapping claims from Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona described Mr. Carter's decision to invite China to participate in joint military exercises as ""foolishness"" given the Chinese actions in the sea.
""For us to reward them by engaging in joint military activities when they are conducting military activities which are in direct violation of international law is clearly encouraging them for further adventures in the region,"" Mr. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on the sidelines of the conference.
Mr. McCain warned that China is planning to cover the disputed South China Sea with an Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ. An ADIZ demarcates a zone outside a country's national airspace where planes must identify themselves for security reasons and follow the country's military instructions.
China initiated an ADIZ over islands it disputes with Japan in the East China Sea in 2013. Japan already had an ADIZ of its own in the area.
A senior U.S. defense official said such a move in the South China Sea would be provocative, but wouldn't change the American military's activities in the region or waters.
The tribunal set up under the 1982 U.N. convention has no power to enforce its decisions, so the case essentially threatens China with only reputational damage.
Mr. McCain said countries would have to band together to enforce and legitimate the judgment. ""Its enforcement requires serious political will among defenders of the law,"" he said. ""The legitimacy of this arbitration decision will be derived from the actions of nations that are not parties to the case, especially those in Southeast Asia.""

U.S.-China Talks Set to Open With Fresh Concerns Over Beijing's Sea Claims; U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrives in China for talks amid strains over the South China Sea,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1793803100?accountid=14586,"Â 
BEIJING--U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in China on Sunday for annual talks, with old and new strains over the South China Sea expected to cast a tense shadow on the last round of high-level consultations before President Barack Obama leaves office.
The annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue is a three-day affair that draws hundreds of U.S. and Chinese officials from a variety of agencies. They are led on the U.S. side by Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and on the Chinese side by State Councilor Yang Jiechi and Vice Premier Wang Yang.
The intent of the annual talks, which Mr. Obama launched in 2009, is to try to find common ground even as the great powers tussle over maritime and cyber security, as well as a host of economic issues .

Disputed claims in the South China Sea are likely to overshadow security discussions as Beijing pursues a series of major reclamation projects on disputed islands and reefs, part of an area variously claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The Pentagon views China's reclamation of more than 3,200 acres of land over the past two years in parts of the disputed South China Sea as coercive and intended to advance its interests while stopping just short of provoking war.
U.S. officials now are concerned that China will establish an air defense identification zone over the South China Sea, restricting flights by other countries. On Sunday, while in Mongolia before heading to China, Mr. Kerry said such a move would be ""provocative and destabilizing"" and would ""automatically raise tensions and call into serious question China's commitment to diplomatically managing territorial disputes in the South China Sea.""
China hasn't announced plans for a new air defense identification zone, but has long maintained it has a right to establish such zones, as do other countries.
An ADIZ demarcates a zone outside a country's national airspace where planes must identify themselves for security reasons and follow the country's military instructions.
Mr. Kerry urged China ""not to move unilaterally in ways that are provocative"" and reiterated the U.S. position on Sunday that it doesn't take sides among the claimants in the South China Sea but urges peaceful resolution of disputes.
Mr. Kerry is on a trip that also will take him to the Middle East, where he will visit officials in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. His visit to Saudi Arabia will precede an expected visit to Washington later in June by Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi deputy crown prince and son of King Salman.
The U.S. has been using military aircraft and naval vessels to challenge Beijing's claims. Last month the U.S. sent a guided missile destroyer within 12 nautical miles of a part of the disputed Spratly Islands and deployed a U.S. reconnaissance plane near Chinese-claimed territory.
Beijing repeatedly has said it considers recent moves by Washington as dangerous provocations.
""This may affect other aspects of the relationship,"" said Jia Qingguo, dean of Peking University's School of International Relations, and a U.S.-China specialist.
The U.S. in the past has challenged China's establishment of another air defense zone in the region, over the East China Sea, by flying American military aircraft through the area without first obtaining permission.
Military officials from both countries will participate in a strategic track of discussions this week chaired on the U.S. side by Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken. Officials previewing the talks said the sides would candidly discuss the South China Sea, North Korea and maritime and cyber security.
The annual talks also come ahead of a ruling expected in the coming weeks from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, where the Philippines has challenged China's expansive maritime claim to the South China Sea under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
The U.S. views the ruling as binding, regardless of its outcome.
Concerns over China's actions in the South China Sea also dominated a high-profile security conference in Singapore known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, attended by both Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Admiral Sun Jianguo, deputy chief of the People's Liberation Army's general staff department.
New developments concerning North Korea will represent another source of strain at this week's talks. The U.S. and China partnered earlier this year to enact tough sanctions on Pyongyang in response to continued arms and nuclear tests. But in a move that will add to the tension between the two powers, Washington took additional steps last week to further isolate North Korea from the global financial system that could bring Beijing and Washington into direct economic conflict. Pyongyang's biggest trading partner--China--likely will feel the effects.
""China has the ability to both create pressure and use that as a leverage that is a very important part of global efforts to isolate North Korea and get North Korea to change its policies,"" a senior Treasury Department official told reporters in Seoul, where Mr. Lew stopped before heading to the talks. The official said Mr. Lew and others would urge China to up the pressure on Pyongyang to denuclearize.
Last year's two-nation summit in Washington took place shortly after U.S. officials blamed China for a massive hack on the Office of Personnel Management that affected millions of personnel records. Since then, the U.S. and China have moved to repair ties on that front--Mr. Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced an agreement last September that neither nation would conduct or support the online theft of trade secrets or intellectual property.
They also created a higher-level cyber dialogue hosted by cabinet officials that first convened in December 2015 in Washington and is set to take place again in Beijing later this month. China had pulled out of lower-level cyber talks in 2014 after the U.S. indicted five People's Liberation Army officers for cybersleuthing and the December talks were the first dedicated to the topic since then. But U.S. officials continue to be concerned with China's cyber activities and cybersecurity firms have reported continued breaches by China even after the fall agreement.

China Is Acting Within Its Sovereign Rights; 'The origin of the South China Sea dispute is not China's territorial ambition but the illegal seizure and occupation of Chinese territory.',"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1795056916?accountid=14586,"Â  Regarding your editorial ""South China Sea Challenge "" (June 3), the origin of the South China Sea dispute is not China's territorial ambition but instead the illegal seizure and occupation of Chinese territory by other countries.
The islands and shoals in the South China Sea have long been Chinese territory. After World War II, China restored its sovereignty over them from Japanese occupation in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and Potsdam Proclamation, an act upholding postwar rules. But since the 1970s, 42 out of 51 land features in the Nansha Islands have been illegally occupied by other countries.
The 1898 Treaty of Paris, the 1900 Treaty of Washington and the 1930 Convention Between the U.S. and Great Britain defined the western limit of the Philippine's territory as 118 east longitude, reaffirmed by the Philippine Constitution in 1935. China's islands and reefs in the South China Sea, including Huangyan Dao (Scarborough Shoal), are all west of that line.
These historic rights are not superseded by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). In fact, Unclos respects the historic rights that predate it and are continuously claimed. By not accepting or participating in the arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines, China is simply exercising its legitimate sovereign rights under Unclos.
China has already signed border treaties through peaceful negotiations with 12 out of 14 of its land neighbors. The same practice should be adopted in the South China Sea.
U.S. military operations in the South China Sea only fuel tensions. The moves suggested by this editorial are even more reckless and alarming. No country's interests are served by turning the South China Sea into a geopolitical competing ground.
The U.S. often emphasizes the importance of reducing tension and maintaining the space necessary for diplomatic solution. We hope the U.S. will match its words with deeds.

"China to Hold Military Exercises in South China Sea, Raising Tensions; Announcement comes ahead of international tribunal's ruling on China's claims in the area","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1801323376?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China's military plans exercises in the disputed South China Sea this week, adding to tensions ahead of an international tribunal's ruling that is expected to challenge Beijing's maritime claims in the area .
The drills, announced in a brief online statement Sunday, are scheduled to stretch over seven days starting Tuesday and ending July 11, the day before the United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague is expected to issue its ruling. Beijing has repeatedly said it will ignore the verdict despite pressure from the U.S. and its allies to comply.
U.S. Navy ships have conducted exercises around the South China Sea in recent weeks and on Friday the Navy said an aircraft-carrier strike group was operating in the sea, without saying precisely where or how long it would stay. U.S. officials have warned that Beijing could respond to the ruling by expanding its recent island-building or declaring an air-defense zone in the area.
China's Maritime Safety Administration, in announcing the exercises, gave geographic coordinates for the drills in an area running east of China's Hainan Island down to and including the Paracel Islands.
""Entering prohibited,"" it said in English. The Paracels are controlled by China but also claimed by Vietnam, where government officials didn't respond to requests for comment.
Chinese defense ministry officials couldn't be reached for comment Sunday. In a speech on Friday to mark the 95th anniversary of the Communist Party's founding, President Xi Jinping said that China would never compromise on its sovereignty and was ""not afraid of trouble.""
China normally issues public notices in advance of military exercises, which it conducts regularly in the South China Sea and elsewhere.
The timing and location of these latest drills seem particularly provocative. They coincide with U.S.-led joint naval exercises off Hawaii which Chinese navy ships are joining for the second time as part of efforts to improve military relations.
The tribunal in The Hague is widely expected to rule against China on several counts in a case brought by the Philippines in 2013 challenging the legality of Beijing's claims to almost all of the South China Sea.
China's claims overlap with those of Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan , as well as those of Vietnam and the Philippines--a U.S. treaty ally. Analysts have said that among Beijing's concerns are that the tribunal's verdict will trigger copycat suits.
One possible Chinese response, U.S. officials say, would be to declare an air-defense identification zone in the area, like the one Beijing established over the East China Sea in 2013, which requires all foreign aircraft to identify themselves before entering.
Another is for China, which has already built seven artificial islands in the South China Sea in the past two years, to begin land reclamation at another disputed outcrop, known as the Scarborough Shoal, which Beijing seized control of from the Philippines in 2012.
China says it has the right to do both, but hasn't declared any specific plans for either. U.S. officials have warned that either move could force Washington to take action, without specifying what that response might be.
Last month, the U.S. sent two aircraft carriers to take part in joint naval drills with India and Japan in the Philippine Sea. One of them, the USS Ronald Reagan, and its strike group then moved into the South China Sea, the U.S. Navy said on Friday.
""Our forward-deployed ships are operating here to maintain the seas open for all to use,"" it quoted Rear Admiral John D. Alexander, commander of Task Force 70, which includes the USS Ronald Reagan strike group, as saying. The U.S. Navy didn't respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
At a monthly news conference on Thursday, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Col Wu Qian accused the U.S. of sending its forces into the South China Sea to undermine Beijing's resolve to protect its own national sovereignty.
""It is an act of militarization in the South China Sea and it endangers regional peace and stability,"" he said. ""But I'd like to say that the U.S. side is making the wrong calculation. The Chinese armed forces never give in to outside forces.""

World News -- China's World: Beijing Digs In Heels Over South China Sea,"Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1803320621?accountid=14586,"Â  SHANGHAI -- This was the humiliating result that China feared most: A small country, the Philippines, took on and comprehensively defeated the aspiring regional hegemon in an international court of law. Beijing can't back down.
After an unambiguous and unanimous legal verdict that strikes down Beijing's historic claims to the South China Sea, rebukes it for turning coral reefs into island fortresses through massive dredging and sides with bullied Philippine fishermen, the Chinese government's legitimacy is on the line.
China's response will be guided by the reactions of a nationalistic public and a conviction that the judges in The Hague who delivered their stinging judgment were pawns in a U.S. conspiracy to contain China's rise. China will now turn its wrath on America. Before the verdict, the China Daily denounced the case as a ""farce directed by Washington."" On Tuesday, Xinhua News Agency used similar language, calling it a ""farce directed with meticulous care by outside forces.""
At a time of rapidly rising tensions, the immediate danger is that miscalculations or accidents could draw China and America into conflict.
Ahead of the decision as China's denunciations of The Hague tribunal reached a crescendo, China held live-fire drills off the Paracels, a group of South China Sea islands it controls. China is ""not afraid of trouble,"" President Xi Jinping asserted. Earlier, America sent an aircraft-carrier battle group into the region.
On a map, the ""nine-dash line"" that the tribunal has invalidated looks like a cow's tongue hanging from China's southern coast and encompassing almost the entire South China Sea. In the eyes of the Chinese public, it is a proud marker of their country's spreading power and prestige. It is stamped into every new Chinese passport. Likewise, the artificial islands have become emblems of China's resurgence.
For a country that regularly invokes the sanctity of international law, citing its own victimization in the era of arrogant imperialism, the outcome is a moral challenge, as well as a legal one. Two years ago, Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged a United Nations gathering to ""reject the law of the jungle where the strong do what they want and the weak suffer what they must.""
If China follows the ruling with further attempts to alter regional geography by dredging additional islands, or grabbing more bits of disputed territory, or trying to assert control of the skies over the South China Sea -- all possibilities -- it will be seen by much of the world as an outlaw on the wrong side of justice.
Behind the turbulence in the South China Sea are two clashing Chinese priorities: its desire for a peaceful rise as a great nation, and a growing determination to recover every scrap of what it deems to be lost territory and control its ""near seas,"" which means pushing the U.S. military away.
Reflecting this stark contradiction, China's approach to its Asian neighbors has veered between charm and belligerence.
Southeast Asian officials still smart at the comments and body language of former Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, who at a meeting of regional leaders in Hanoi in 2010 drilled the Singapore representative with a stare, wagged his forefinger and declared: ""China is a big country and other countries are small countries, and that's just a fact.""
If China expected that the Philippines and other littoral states would simply defer to a new regional master and accept their place in a Chinese-ordered hierarchy, they've been disabused. Manila's decision to resist, with American encouragement, has made China apoplectic.
A few days ago, Dai Bingguo, a retired foreign-policy mandarin, warned Manila to avoid further provocations.
Inspired by Manila's landmark victory, however, copycat legal cases may now follow from one or more of the other claimants to the South China Sea. Hanoi is the most likely to follow suit.
Chinese leaders have painted themselves into a corner. They've linked their vision of restoring China's ancient position of pre-eminence in East Asia to the recovery of land, be it specks of coral in the South China Sea, rocky outcrops in the East China Sea disputed with Japan, or Taiwan, by far the most important estranged portion of the Motherland. This is the emotional heart of President Xi's ""China Dream.""
China's actions in pursuit of this formula for national greatness have stirred anxieties, fueled an arms race and spawned coalitions of smaller powers to counter Chinese territorial ambitions.
The dredged islands have only limited military utility. In the event of conflict a fusillade of missiles could return them to the sea bed instantly. (A supertyphoon might have a similar effect.)
Crucially, however, they are costly tokens of China's commitment to challenge American primacy in Asia.
This is a moment of reckoning for Beijing. Ultimately, it must decide between tranquility in its neighborhood and nationalist ambition. Its increasingly assertive position that its rise can only come at the territorial expense of its neighbors has met a legal barrier.
Beijing can have regional stability or revanchist dreams; it can't have both.

How the Philippines Can Enforce the South China Sea Verdict; The South China Sea can never become a Chinese lake as China intended under its nine-dash-line claim.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1804702037?accountid=14586,"Â  The historic ruling of an international tribunal in the Philippines v. China arbitration clarifies with finality the South China Sea maritime zones to which the Philippines and China are entitled under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). The ruling also clarifies the use by other states of the waters of the sea.
The ruling strikes down as illegal China's ""nine-dash line"" as a claim to nearly 90% of the waters of the sea. The result is that some 25% of the waters are high seas, found in the sea's center. High seas, where there is freedom of navigation and overflight for civilian and military vessels and aircraft of all nations, belong to mankind.
The illegality of the nine-dash line also affirms that around the high seas are the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of coastal states: the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam and China. The prevailing view, adhered to by an overwhelming majority of states, is that within the EEZs there is also freedom of navigation and overflight for civilian and military vessels and aircraft. No permission is required from a coastal state for the vessels and aircraft of other states to sail or fly there. China belongs to a small minority of states that hold the opposite view, that foreign military vessels and aircraft must secure the permission of the coastal state before sailing or flying in that state's EEZ.
Who will enforce the parts of the ruling affirming the existence of the high seas and EEZs? While there is no world policeman to do so, the world's naval powers, led by the U.S., have declared that they will sail and fly in the high seas and EEZs of the South China Sea to assert freedom of navigation and overflight for their military and civilian vessels and aircraft. Since China cannot prevent the world's naval powers from asserting such freedom of navigation and overflight, an important part of the ruling will definitely be enforced. The South China Sea can never become a Chinese lake as China intended under its nine-dash-line claim.
The illegality of the nine-dash line also means that it can't overlap with the EEZ of the Philippines. Any overlap could only come from maritime zones emanating from geologic features--actual land territories--claimed by China. The ruling declared that not a single geologic feature in the entire Spratly archipelago is entitled to a 200-mile EEZ, not even Itu Aba, the largest feature in the Spratlys. It declared that some features are uninhabitable natural ""rocks"" entitled only to 12-mile territorial seas. The ruling also held that Scarborough Shoal is entitled only to a 12-mile territorial sea.
The result is that only two rocks controlled by China, McKennan Reef and Scarborough Shoal, are within the Philippine EEZ. These two features are entitled only to a 12-mile territorial sea. Thus the entire Philippine EEZ in the South China Sea--estimated at 381,000 square kilometers, larger than the total land territory of the Philippines--is free from any overlapping claim from China, except for the two small 12-mile territorial seas of McKennan Reef and Scarborough Shoal.
How can the Philippines enforce its exclusive right to exploit the natural resources in its EEZ if China rejects the ruling? Again, there is no world police, but the Philippines is not helpless.
If a Chinese oil company brings a gas platform to Reed Bank, within the Philippine EEZ, to extract gas, the Philippines can sue the company in a state where the company has assets, like Canada, which is a member of Unclos. The Philippines can show the Canadian court the ruling that the gas in the Reed Bank belongs to the Philippines. The Philippines can ask the Canadian court to seize the assets of the Chinese firm in Canada to compensate the Philippines for the loss of the gas.
The Philippines can also seek reparations from China for damages. The ruling held that China's dredging inflicted irreparable injury to the fragile marine ecosystem in the Spratlys, including Mischief Reef and Subi Reef, which form part of the Philippine continental shelf. Under the Law of the Sea, a state is liable for damages for causing harm to the marine environment of a coastal state.
The Philippines can also ask the International Seabed Authority, a creation of Unclos, to suspend the four permits it issued to China to explore the seabed in the high seas beyond national jurisdiction. States that ratified Unclos agreed to accept it as a ""package deal""--accepting its provisions entirely and not selectively. If China rejects the ruling, the Philippines can assert that China is accepting the benefits of Unclos under its seabed provisions but rejecting its provisions under its dispute settlement mechanism.
Over time the ruling will be enforced substantially because the world will never accept that a single state can claim ownership to almost an entire sea that is bordered by several states. Such a precedent would mean the demise of the Law of the Sea.

China to Continue Construction on Disputed Islands; Comments from China's navy chief come days after The Hague rejected Beijing's claims over South China Sea,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1804878371?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China's navy chief told his U.S. counterpart that Beijing would continue construction work on disputed South China Sea islands regardless of foreign opposition, state media said, underscoring Chinese defiance toward an unfavorable international-arbitration ruling.
Adm. Wu Shengli's comments on Monday came days after a July 12 arbitration tribunal at The Hague rejected Beijing's historic and economic claims over much of the South China Sea , handing a legal victory to the Philippines, which had brought the case. The ruling also excoriated China's efforts to build artificial islands in the Spratlys chain, known as Nansha in Chinese.
""We will never stop our construction on the Nansha Islands halfway...no matter what country or person applies pressure,"" Adm. Wu told U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson during a meeting in Beijing, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Adm. Wu defended the construction--spanning land reclamation and the building of lighthouses and airstrips--as ""justified and lawful,"" and warned that efforts to coerce China ""will only have the opposite effect,"" Xinhua said.
Monday's meeting was part of Adm. Richardson's first visit to China as U.S. Navy chief.
""The overall tone of the meeting was positive, but the discussions were certainly candid and frank,"" U.S. Navy Cdr. Chris Servello said. ""Admiral Richardson conveyed the importance of adhering to international laws and norms and reiterated that U.S. forces will sail, fly and operate where [the] laws allow.""
China has boycotted the arbitration and said it would ignore the ruling, but some observers say the verdict could prompt Beijing to start reclaiming land and building facilities on Scarborough Shoal, a South China Sea outcrop also claimed by the Philippines.
Monday's meeting coincided with a Chinese air force statement saying that it recently flew long-range bomber aircraft near Scarborough Shoal, an uninhabited clump of rocks, sandbars and coral reefs near valuable fishing grounds, also known as Huangyan Island in Chinese.
The People's Liberation Army Air Force didn't specify when the ""air combat patrol"" took place, or whether it was before or after the tribunal's ruling. The patrol featured the H-6K bomber--a Chinese variant of a Russian-designed jet--as well as fighter, reconnaissance and tanker aircraft, the air force said Monday on its verified Weibo microblog.
Such patrols over the South China Sea will become ""regular"" practice, and are part of the PLAAF's efforts to carry out more realistic combat training, air force spokesman Sr. Col. Shen Jinke said in the Weibo statement.
The statement didn't say how many aircraft were involved in the patrol, nor did it reveal how close they came to Scarborough Shoal, control of which China seized from the Philippines in 2012. It wasn't clear whether the patrol was linked to PLA exercises in the South China Sea that ended on July 11.
China's Defense Ministry didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment on the patrol.
It wasn't clear if Adm. Wu and Adm. Richardson discussed the patrol in their meeting, which also broached bilateral naval cooperation. The PLA Navy is participating in U.S.-led joint naval drills held in waters near Hawaii, which end in early August.
Washington has publicly warned China against reclaiming land around Scarborough Shoal, located 120 nautical miles from the Philippines and some 250 nautical miles northeast of the artificial islands Beijing has built in the disputed Spratlys archipelago over the past two years. In April, the U.S. flew three different air patrols near the shoal as a signal of its concerns about possible Chinese plans for the area.

China Moves Toward Launching Credit-Default-Swap Market; China's interbank-market regulator is likely to seek approval from China's central bank to launch a CDS market soon,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1808558121?accountid=14586,"Â  SHANGHAI--China is edging closer to launching its own version of a popular hedging tool that protects investors in case of defaults, as the world's No. 2 economy struggles to cope with slowing growth and record numbers of companies not paying back debt.
The National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, an industry body backed by China's central bank, has consulted major banks and brokerage firms in recent weeks about the planned rollout of credit-default swaps, three people familiar with the situation said. The swaps would pay out if the issuer of a bond or a loan defaults, said the people, who were briefed by the regulator on the matter.
The regulator, which oversees China's $8.5 trillion interbank bond market, has drafted guidelines and standardized contracts for the product, one that has in the past two decades become a key tool in global markets to hedge government and corporate debt , the people said.
NAFMII has hired a group of lawyers to help align its CDS rules with internationally accepted practices and is expected to ask the People's Bank of China for formal approval to launch the market soon, one of the people said.
Officials at NAFMII weren't reachable for comment.
The planned rollout of rules for CDS reflects the pressures China faces as it tries to attract more investors, including global players, to a swelling bond market, even as debt defaults soar. China's domestic bond market has had 39 defaults totaling around 25 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) this year, already exceeding the total of 20 defaults worth 12 billion yuan for all of last year. In 2014, there were five such defaults, following one in 2013.
""If the [CDS plan] is carried out well in China, it will certainly be a big help to investors,"" said Wang Ming, a partner at Shanghai Yaozhi Asset Management Co., a bond fund that manages two billion yuan in assets.
China experimented with a less sophisticated version of a CDS called a credit-risk-mitigation agreement, or CRMA, in 2010, in the wake of a credit binge. But the CRMA market never took off, because the state kept bailing out insolvent companies instead of letting them default, in the interests of financial and social stability.
Now, there are signs that Beijing and the country's local governments are becoming more tolerant of debt defaults as the economy weakens further and governments feel increased fiscal strains.
""The timing is indeed better now for CDS to be introduced to China. Given that all kinds of defaults are on the rise, I think demand will be quite robust,"" Mr. Wang said.
The guidelines and standardized contracts for the credit derivative drafted by NAFMII look to be in line with those published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a global body based in New York that sets standard terms for derivatives transactions, said one of the people briefed on the instruments.
So great is the enthusiasm for CDS in China that some officials seem to view them as a way to help ailing companies get credit. The government of the northern province of Shanxi, China's biggest coal-producing region, said it hopes to encourage credit-default swaps as a means to raise investor confidence in debt issued by the area's struggling coal-mining firms. Typically big coal miners are backed by the state.
According to a front-page article published Thursday in the Shanxi Daily, the Communist Party's local mouthpiece, companies from the region are facing greater difficulties in issuing new debt because of a weakening economy and rising debt defaults among state-run enterprises.
One of the coal-mining firms from the province that is struggling to meet its debt repayment, state-backed ChinaCoal Group Shanxi Huayu Energy Co., defaulted on a 600 million yuan one-year bond in April.
""We've already come up with a plan, and Shanxi would like to become the first local government to roll out a CDS contract in China,"" said Liu Hongbo, an official at the financial affairs office of the Shanxi provincial government.
CDS are normally created by investment banks, which calculate the default risks involved and charge sometimes steep fees for the guarantees, and it is unclear how Shanxi province proposes to handle them.

"The Specter of an Accidental China-U. S. War; As China flexes its muscles in the South China Sea, the risks of an inadvertent clash with the U.S. are growing","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1811529813?accountid=14586,"Â  SHANGHAI--The last time America and China went to war--in Korea in 1950--they fought each other to a standstill.
Later that decade, as the Cold War ramped up, they came close to blows again; the Eisenhower administration repeatedly threatened ""Red China"" with nuclear devastation as tensions bubbled over Taiwan.
Today, given the astronomical stakes at play, many assume that armed conflict between the two giants is out of the question. They are each other's largest trading partner . Military confrontation wouldn't only threaten these huge flows but also student exchanges , scientific collaboration, joint technical projects and the myriad other ways in which the fates and fortunes of the world's two largest economies and their peoples are inextricably linked.
Yet, as China flexes its muscles in the South China Sea and East China Sea, the risks of an inadvertent clash on the water or in the air are growing by the day.
A new RAND Corp study says that a Sino-U. S. war as a result of such a crisis ""cannot be considered implausible.""
Violence could ignite quickly, the report warns. That is because each side has deployed precision-guided munitions, as well as cyber and space technologies, able to inflict devastating damage on the other's military assets, including Chinese land-based missile batteries and American aircraft carriers. Thus they have a strong incentive to launch massive strikes first as part of a ""use it or lose it"" calculation.
Once out of control, fighting could be prolonged, although it is unlikely to go nuclear, according to the RAND study sponsored by the U.S. Army. Both nations possess the military, industrial and demographic resources to absorb heavy losses and slog on. As in Korea, there would likely be no clear victor.
Washington and Beijing ""need to contemplate the possibility of a severe, lengthy, uncontrollable and devastating, yet indecisive, conflict,"" the RAND paper asserts.
This is the troubling context in which to view China's defiant response to last month's ruling by a panel of jurists in The Hague, who struck down Beijing's claims to almost the entire South China Sea and rebuked it for dredging artificial islands topped by military-capable runways that have intimidated other claimants, including Vietnam and the Philippines.
Instead of backing off, China has doubled down on its assertive strategy, flying a bomber over the Scarborough Shoal , which it has effectively seized from the Philippines, announcing war games with Russia and sending militia fleets swarming into waters contested with Japan.
The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, has published satellite photos showing aircraft hangers springing up on the fake islands, reinforced apparently to withstand air attack.
So far there are no signs that the People's Liberation Army has stationed military aircraft on the mid-sea platforms.
Then again, some Western experts think China may be biding its time so as not to spoil a Group-of-20 summit of leading economies it is hosting for the first time next month. Watch out for even more aggressive moves between then and the U.S. presidential election in November, they say.
Washington's response to The Hague ruling has been conspicuously restrained. U.S. officials seem to hope that avoiding provocative words and actions, such as sending warships steaming close by the island fortresses in ""freedom of navigation"" missions, will make it easier for Beijing to find a graceful way to comply with the ruling over time.
For the U.S., striking the right balance between displays of conciliation and resolve is critical. As the RAND report argues, war is much more likely to arise as a result of China misjudging America's willingness to defend its East Asian allies, and pushing them too far, than from a premeditated attack.
Indeed, Chinese leaders -- arch-realists on foreign policy -- may even feel emboldened now. Their man-made islands are a fait accompli; the tribunal has no power to enforce its judgment. Southeast Asia has been silent. So has a struggling Europe, as ever, most concerned with ginning up Chinese investment.
""Nobody is pushing back,"" says Jennifer Lind, an East Asia specialist at Dartmouth College. She thinks the Chinese strategy has been successful. ""They control more territory; they have more influence than ever before,"" she says.
Worryingly, the RAND report notes an increasing confidence among Chinese military strategists that they could conduct a short, sharp and victorious war.
Among the report's recommendations: America should make clear it doesn't favor pre-emptive strikes against China and must ""expand communications with China in times of peace, crisis, and war.""
On that latter objective, history isn't encouraging. In 2001, when a Chinese fighter ran into an America spy plane, its pilot killing himself and forcing the crippled U.S. plane to make an emergency landing on Hainan Island, then U.S. President George W. Bush tried to reach his Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, on a hotline. Mr. Jiang wouldn't take the call.

Philippines Says China Is Bolstering Presence in South China Sea; Philippines' Duterte to meet with China officials after Manila alleges new Beijing activity in disputed shoal,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1816764535?accountid=14586,"Â  MANILA--The Philippines said new surveillance images showed that Beijing is stepping up its presence in disputed South China Sea waters, raising the specter of a diplomatic clash as President Rodrigo Duterte attends his first regional summits.
Mr. Duterte's government Monday summoned the Chinese ambassador to explain why Beijing had sent a flotilla of 10 ships, including dredgers and barges, to a shoal that an international tribunal ruled belonged to Manila. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said a Philippine military pilot had photographed the flotilla on Scarborough Shoal on Saturday. He said there was no sign of dredging work but the ships' presence implied intent.
""If they try to construct anything in Scarborough, it will have [a] far-reaching adverse effect on the security situation,"" Mr. Lorenzana said.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said China ""has maintained a Coast Guard patrol and there are some fishing boats undertaking fishing operations in the area. The situation hasn't changed. We hope it won't be hyped up, and that both sides can work together to build trust.""
During his two months in office, Mr. Duterte has generally shunned international diplomatic norms. He has berated the United Nations secretary-general, international human- rights agencies and the U.S. ambassador to Manila, accusing them of meddling in the country's internal affairs by criticizing his bloody war on drugs and crime.
He often does so using off-color language, such as on Monday when he referred to U.S. President Barack Obama in Tagalog with an expression widely translated to mean ""son of a bitch."" Mr. Obama subsequently canceled a Tuesday meeting with Mr. Duterte.
Yet Mr. Duterte has so far been more circumspect on China, as he seeks to repair relations that have reached new lows recently over the two countries' territorial rivalry.
The revelation over the flotilla at Scarborough Shoal will test Mr. Duterte's approach when he is scheduled this week to meet with Chinese officials and other leaders at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit and the East Asia Summit in Laos.
""Why is China treating us this way?"" said Mr. Duterte, according to Agriculture Secretary Manny PiÃ±ol, who attended a cabinet security briefing at which Mr. Duterte was shown the surveillance photos. In a Facebook post on Sunday, Mr. PiÃ±ol said Mr. Duterte was upset to learn that China seemed determined to provoke the Philippines, despite his conciliatory efforts.
Diplomacy is a new remit for Mr. Duterte. He spent most of his career as a mayor in the southern Philippine city of Davao, where he earned a reputation for taking a no-nonsense approach. His experience there is a world away from the tightly choreographed arena of foreign relations.
Beijing has rejected the tribunal's ruling but made overtures to Mr. Duterte, inviting him to reset bilateral relations and open negotiations. He reciprocated in August by dispatching former President Fidel Ramos to Hong Kong to meet senior Chinese officials to prepare the ground for formal talks later this year. While making clear that he wouldn't set aside The Hague ruling when joining China at the negotiating table, Mr. Duterte said he was eager to mend ties and enlist Beijing as a much-needed development partner. Last week he promised not to raise the sensitive matter of the arbitration case in Laos so as not to antagonize the Chinese.
The Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila didn't respond to requests for comment.
China has dismayed its neighbors over the last two years by reclaiming land and building artificial islets in seven other locations in the disputed South China Sea, which is also claimed in part by Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. Chinese officials have consistently said that Beijing is within its rights to build within what it regards as Chinese sovereign territory.
Earlier this year, Beijing looked set to start similar construction work at Scarborough Shoal--a semi-submerged reef--until Mr. Obama warned in March that the U.S., a close Philippine ally, wouldn't tolerate such a move.
Scarborough Shoal is located roughly 140 miles west of the main Philippine island of Luzon, making any future Chinese base there a potential threat to the security of the Philippines and the thousands of U.S. personnel who will soon deploy there under the terms of a recent defense agreement.
The shoal was an important source of livelihood for hundreds of Filipino fishermen until Chinese vessels took control of the area following a monthslong standoff with the Philippine Navy in 2012. They have been blocked from entering since then.
The South China Sea issue comes as Mr. Duterte is grappling with the aftermath of a terrorist bombing in Davao, which claimed 14 lives last weekend. On Monday, police said security forces were searching for four suspects.
Mr. Duterte on Monday bristled over a question on how he would react if Mr. Obama were to raise the issue of extrajudicial killings under the Philippine leader's crackdown.
""The Philippines is not a vassal state--we have long since ceased to be a colony of the United States,"" he said. He then spoke in Tagalog, referring to Mr. Obama with the slur.
Following the comments, Mr. Obama cast doubt on his meeting with Mr. Duterte, which had been scheduled for Tuesday, questioning whether it could be productive. His office later announced it was canceled. The U.S. president said he directed his aides to talk with their Philippine counterparts after learning of Mr. Duterte's comments that Mr. Obama has no standing to confront him about human rights.

What the China Trade Warriors Get Wrong,"Wall Street Journal, Europe; Brussels",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1832974595?accountid=14586,"Â  After three intense presidential debates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump managed to agree on at least one thing: The Trans-Pacific Partnership is bad for America, in part because many trade deals have supposedly caused trade deficits. Unfortunately, they're both wrong. The U.S. would be better served by candidates who speak frankly about the complexity of international commerce -- rather than offer murky platitudes about supposedly harmful trade agreements.
The U.S. had a $334.1 billion trade deficit with China in 2015, including services, according to the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. It also had a $77.3 billion deficit with Germany and $55.4 billion with Japan. What do all these countries have in common? None have trade agreements with the U.S. Mr. Trump can't ""renegotiate"" trade deals that were never negotiated.
The U.S. also maintains trade surpluses with many countries. It ran a $31.7 billion trade surplus with Hong Kong last year, $17.5 billion with Singapore and $12 billion with the United Kingdom. Although a few trade-surplus partners have free-trade agreements with the U.S., it would be incongruous to attribute both surpluses and deficits to such accords. This bipartisan hullabaloo about some alleged link between trade deals and trade deficits is simply false -- politically convenient fiction.
Trade critics might instead tie the rise of China's exports to its joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's trade adviser, said in a recent interview that Bill Clinton lobbying for China's entrance into the WTO ""was the worst political and economic mistake in American history in the last 100 years."" He added that ""China had much higher tariffs than everywhere else, so the U.S. and Europe in particular got the short end of that stick.""
Mr. Navarro is wrong too. China joining the WTO had zero effect on U.S. tariffs against Chinese imports. But it did force China to cut weighted-average tariffs to 19.8% in 1996, down from 32.2% in 1992, according to World Bank estimates. They shrank farther to 14.6% in 2000 and 3.2% by 2014. Yet U.S. tariffs remained unchanged by China's entry into WTO, staying between 2% and 3% on a weighted average.
To be accepted by WTO members, China also had to shut down state industries after 1995. In a 2005 article for the China Economic Review, John Giles of Michigan State and Albert Park of the University of Michigan, with Juwei Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, investigated China's true unemployment rate. They found that China's ""aggressive restructuring led to the layoffs of 45 million workers between 1995 and 2002, including 36 million from the state sector."" If China's entrance to the WTO was about ""stealing jobs,"" it certainly got off to a bad start. Even in the world's most populous country, those tens of millions of lost jobs had a big effect.
In an August 2015 paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Johns Hopkins economists Robert Moffitt and Yingyao Hu, with Shuaizhang Feng of Shanghai University, estimate that the unemployment rate in China stood at around 3.9% between 1988 and 1995, ""when the labor market was highly regulated and dominated by state-owned enterprises."" It then rose greatly between 1995 and 2002 and hit an average of 10.9% between 2002 and 2009.
A frequently misquoted source of the assumption that China's industrial gains were due to WTO membership is a paper called ""The China Shock"" by MIT economist David Autor and his colleagues David Dorn and Gordon Hanson. An article in The Wall Street Journal about this China shock said, ""Imports from China as a percentage of U.S. economic output doubled within four years of China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. . . . By last year, imports from China equaled 2.7% of U.S. gross domestic product.""
Those numbers might appear to suggest U.S. imports surged after 2001, but it was actually Chinese imports that exploded. China's global imports jumped to 29.2% of GDP in 2005, according to the World Bank, up from 18.3% in 2001. Meantime, U.S. exports of goods to China quickly rose to $69.7 billion in 2008 from $19.2 billion in 2001, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. With services added, the U.S. exported $169.2 billion worth of goods and services to China by 2014.
U.S. global imports recovered modestly from 13.1% of GDP in the recession of 2001 to 15.5% in 2005, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. A decade later, U.S. imports were still 15.5% of GDP -- the same as 2005. The fact that China's share of U.S. imports was up and Japan's down didn't mean the U.S. was importing more.
Despite the popularity of their research among free-trade opponents, Messrs. Autor, Dorn and Hanson don't attribute China's export growth to joining the WTO. Rather, they explain that China's export growth came from the proliferation of market-friendly special economic zones, including free-trade zones. Before joining the WTO, China's exports had already risen 14.2% a year from 1994 to 1999. In a recent interview with the Minneapolis Fed, Mr. Autor said the research ""strongly confirmed"" that China's success was driven by ""falling costs and rising quality.""
When talking about trade, both U.S. presidential candidates have been marching voters down a dead-end street. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton claim larger imports or trade deficits are associated with weaker economic growth, which is the opposite of the U.S. experience. Before peddling risky solutions to a misunderstood problem -- such as threatening huge tariffs on countries or U.S. companies -- the candidates might first take more care to understand, define and explain what they are hoping to fix.

Rodrigo Duterte's China Overtures Appear to Bear Fruit in South China Sea; Philippine government says China seems to have stopped obstructing Philippine fishermen from entering contested waters,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1833121456?accountid=14586,"Â  The Philippine government said China appears to have stopped blocking Filipino fishermen from approaching disputed fishing grounds off the country's western coast, handing a potential victory to President Rodrigo Duterte following his visit to Beijing last week .
If the current situation holds, Mr. Duterte will enjoy an immediate reward for his push to pursue warmer relations with China and chart a foreign policy that is independent of the U.S., a longtime ally.
""For the past three days, it has been observed that there are no longer any Chinese Coast Guard and that Filipino fishing boats are no longer being intercepted,"" presidential spokesman Ernesto Abello told reporters in Manila on Friday.
Chinese vessels have long prevented Filipino fishermen from working in the Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground that both countries claim as being rightfully theirs. An international tribunal at The Hague in July ruled that no country had sovereign rights to the shoal and that there was no legal basis to China's claim to nearly the entire South China Sea.
The verdict had been widely viewed as a victory for the Philippines, but Mr. Duterte has said he would set aside the dispute to rebuild relations with China and harness its financial firepower to help develop infrastructure at home. The Philippine's powerful fishing lobby also pressured Mr. Duterte to negotiate for better access to the shoal.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman at news briefing Friday declined to directly comment on the reports that Filipino fishermen were returning to Scarborough Shoal. The spokesman, Lu Kang, said the Philippines and China discussed cooperating on fishing during Mr. Duterte's visit.
""I can tell you that both sides remain in communication on that,"" he said.
Mr. Duterte, who said he discussed fishing rights with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit, left Beijing with economic agreements and business deals worth some $24 billion. During the same visit, he announced his ""separation"" from the U.S., explaining afterward that he meant his foreign policy wouldn't always align with Washington.
Since taking office in June, Mr. Duterte has raised eyebrows in Washington and elsewhere with a series of frequently coarse remarks about U.S.-Philippine relations, often catching his own aides and officials off guard and raising questions about the solidity of the alliances that the U.S. has attempted to build in East Asia in recent years.
U.S. officials have said that ties with Manila remain strong and that Mr. Duterte hasn't actually done anything to match his rhetoric.
China, meanwhile, appears to be stepping up its diplomacy with other countries in the region whose claims in the South China Sea are contested by Beijing.
Earlier this week, two Chinese frigates and a supply vessel made a port call at Cam Ranh Bay, a strategic deep-water port in southern Vietnam.
The visit was the Chinese navy's first since Vietnam in recent years made a point of opening up the port to foreign navies to encourage a larger international military presence in the South China Sea.
A U.S. Navy destroyer and a submarine tender docked at the facility earlier this month, the first time U.S. warships had visited the site since the normalization of relations between the two countries 21 years ago, barring visits by technical and support craft.
Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak is scheduled to visit China this coming week. In a statement issued Wednesday, Mr. Najib said he aimed to elevate relations with Beijing to new highs. Like the Philippines and Vietnam, Malaysia also claims waters in the South China Sea that are contested by China.

Beijing Concerned by Trum p Questioning 'One China' Policy on Taiwan; President-elect Donald Trump questioned U.S. support for the idea that mainland China and Taiwan are part of 'one China',"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1847765104?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING--China expressed alarm over U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion that he is willing to use a bedrock agreement over Taiwan as a bargaining chip in the already-fraught U.S.-China relationship.
Speaking with Fox News on Sunday , Mr. Trump questioned why the U.S. should continue to observe a ""One-China policy"" unless Beijing is willing to make concessions on policies that obstruct American interests. He identified China's currency tactics, tariffs and military buildup in the South China Sea, and North Korea's nuclear program.
China's Foreign Ministry warned that Mr. Trump risks treading on an issue of unrivaled importance to Beijing. ""We are seriously concerned about it,"" ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press briefing in Beijing on Monday. ""The Taiwan question has a bearing on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and is one of China's core interests.""
Beijing has considered Taiwan a breakaway province since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists set up a government there in 1949, after years of civil war. Washington's agreement to rescind diplomatic recognition of the government in Taiwan and uphold a One-China policy was a precondition for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between U.S. and China in 1979.
""I don't know why we have to be bound by a One-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things,"" Mr. Trump said in the interview.
Mr. Trump had already cast doubt on his administration's willingness to stick by existing diplomatic protocol on Taiwan when he accepted a call by Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Dec. 2.
While Beijing initially played down the phone call by describing it as a trick by Taiwan, Mr. Trump's Sunday comments seemed more unsettling to China. State media lashed out at the remarks, and a tide of furious commentary washed over social media.
Nationalist-leaning tabloid Global Times said in a Chinese-language editorial Monday that the U.S. president-elect might be seen as a savvy deal-maker but ""was as confused as a small child"" on foreign policy.
""The 'One-China' policy isn't something that can be bought and sold,"" it said.
The goal of reunification with Taiwan is one issue on which the Communist Party has near universal domestic support. That means leaders in Beijing have almost nothing to gain politically from including the issue in any negotiations with the U.S.
While Chinese President Xi Jinping has advocated patience in responding to the new Trump administration, no one expects him to back down on questions of sovereignty. He has a range of response options if Mr. Trump continues his rhetoric over Taiwan, including recalling China's ambassador from Washington and sending more military flights in the skies around Taiwan.
China's military sent 10 aircraft through the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines on Saturday, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.
A more immediate response would be to tighten American access to Chinese investment and consumers, even if it hurts the countries' economic ties.
""China's weakest area is the economy. It wouldn't take the initiative to damage its financial and trade relationship with the U.S. for any reason--except for the Taiwan issue,"" said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Beijing's Renmin University.
""I think there is a good possibility [Messrs. Xi and Trump] will fall into a test of each other's wills, and that will introduce a lot of tension into the U.S.-China relationship,"" he said.
China's top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, met retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's pick for national security adviser, during a stop in New York on his way to Latin America in recent days, according to Mr. Geng, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. They talked about important matters in U.S.-China relations, he said, without elaborating.
Even before Mr. Trump's latest comments, his recent anti-China rhetoric has reverberated through the Chinese business community.
China's richest man , Wang Jianlin, who owns U.S. theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and production company Legendary Entertainment, said at a business forum in Beijing on Saturday that Mr. Trump's trade policies could affect the thousands of American workers he employs.
""I've invested $10 billion in the U.S. I have 20,000 employees there,"" Mr. Wang said, according to a transcript of his remarks posted online by his company, Dalian Wanda Group. The tycoon noted the U.S. film industry relies heavily for growth on the Chinese market. ""If things aren't handled well, those 20,000 people won't have food to eat,"" he said.
John Delury, an expert on China and North Korea at South Korea's Yonsei University in Seoul, said Mr. Trump's statements overestimate Beijing's ability to increase pressure on the regime in Pyongyang, North Korea, which China is loath to destabilize.
""China doesn't have the easy solution in its hand, as Trump mistakenly believes,"" Mr. Delury said. ""You're crashing U.S.-China relations for what? For no gain in the case of North Korea.""
On the issue of currency, it is unclear what U.S. pressure could accomplish. Mr. Trump has accused China of keeping its currency artificially low, while Beijing has been spending billions of its currency reserves to keep the yuan from falling too quickly against the dollar.

"Aluminum Billionaire Planning Escape From China: Lawyer; Giant aluminum stockpile in Mexico and Vietnam may represent an effort to get wealth out of China by Liu Zhongtian, chairman of China Zhongwang Holdings","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2016,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1853433688?accountid=14586,"Â  A giant stockpile of aluminum that has crisscrossed the globe remains a puzzle for American executives and investigators trying to unravel the logic behind its movements.
A Dallas attorney's correspondence suggests a surprising possibility: that the stash is a Chinese billionaire's retirement fund.
Like all Chinese citizens, Liu Zhongtian, the 52-year-old chairman of aluminum behemoth China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd., isn't supposed to move more than $50,000 a year out of the Communist Party-led country. To get around the restrictions, Chinese nationals have used Hong Kong money changers to illicitly transfer cash between bank accounts, combined their $50,000 quotas to make large-scale transfers and even carried cash across borders in suitcases.
Mr. Liu developed an industrial-scale approach involving boatloads of aluminum which he stockpiled with plans to sell the metal over time, according to the Dallas attorney's correspondence and people who have worked for Mr. Liu whose accounts are supported by shipping and corporate records.
Mr. Liu sought to establish companies that could control his wealth outside China and set up an office in Switzerland, according to a 2012 email from attorney Herman Randow of Dallas firm Munsch Hardt Kopf & Harr.
""We are at the early stages of this family office,"" Mr. Randow wrote in the email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. ""It will not be robust until Mr. Liu retires and leaves China to live in Switzerland. That is his ultimate goal.""
A China Zhongwang spokeswoman wrote in an email that Mr. Liu ""does not know this law firm, and has never had any business dealing with it."" She added: ""We have no knowledge of the correspondence to which you refer and question its authenticity.""
A spokeswoman for Munsch Hardt Kopf & Harr said the firm doesn't currently represent Mr. Liu ""nor have we represented Mr. Liu or his interests for quite some time."" She said Texas ethics laws prevented her from commenting further. Mr. Randow, who still works for the firm, didn't respond to requests for comment.
The law firm email is a tantalizing clue that could help explain why several large aluminum stockpiles have mysteriously popped up around the world. Metal caches in Mexico and Vietnam have been the subjects of Wall Street Journal articles that have traced the metals' connections to Mr. Liu and businesses tied to him and his family.
Mr. Liu has denied any connection to the aluminum or to the companies moving it around the world. ""As we have repeatedly stated, neither China Zhongwang nor Mr. Liu has connections to the 'stockpile' in Mexico, or the metal in Vietnam,"" his company's spokeswoman wrote.
Most of the Mexican aluminum stockpile was moved to Vietnam, according to trade records and people familiar with the matter. All told, about 1.7 million tons of aluminum has been stored in Vietnam since 2015 by a company co-owned by one of Mr. Liu's business associates, according to trade and corporate records and people familiar with Mr. Liu's business operations. Data provided by Global Trade Information Services, which tracks world-wide trade, values the aluminum at about $5 billion. The metal has been extruded, or turned into various shapes, for sale as products.
The stockpiles are so big that metals-industry officials have been worried they are depressing global aluminum-extrusion prices. The market for aluminum, like other commodities such as steel, has been plagued by a glut driven by supercharged Chinese production.
American executives have accused Mr. Liu of routing inexpensive, government-subsidized aluminum into the U.S. through Mexico and Vietnam to avoid U.S. tariffs. China Zhongwang's products have faced tariffs as high as 374% because a 2010 Commerce Department probe found the company received illegal Chinese subsidies and was ""dumping""--selling aluminum products below market prices.
The Department of Homeland Security is investigating whether U.S. companies linked to Mr. Liu illegally avoided punitive import tariffs on Chinese aluminum, according to people familiar with the probe. In a separate investigation, the Commerce Department ruled this year that China Zhongwang had sidestepped U.S. trade sanctions by disguising its metal in a form not specifically covered by the 2010 trade restrictions.
China Zhongwang said it was no longer selling the type of aluminum targeted by Commerce.
The Dallas attorney's email raises another possibility for the metal: Aluminum, which is commonly traded in dollars, provided a way of moving currency out of China.
In his email, the Dallas attorney, Mr. Randow, emphasized the secret nature of Mr. Liu's plans to set up businesses outside of China and live in Switzerland.
""I want to reinforce that all this information and these relationships absolutely are confidential, and I am not typically authorized to freely disseminate this information to third parties outside of the family office,"" Mr. Randow wrote.
Mr. Randow's email was related to two Swiss companies that he said were owned by Mr. Liu: Eighty Eight Investments AG and Grand Provenance Holdings AG.
Grand Provenance is the parent of GT88 Capital, a Singapore aluminum-trading firm that shipped more than $1 billion worth of aluminum from 2010 to 2013 to a Mexican facility once owned by Mr. Liu's son called Aluminicaste FundiciÃ³n de MÃ©xico, according to shipping and corporate records. The GT88 shipments formed part of the Mexican stockpile under investigation by the Commerce Department, people familiar with the matter say.
Mr. Randow wrote that Grand Provenance and Eighty Eight ""are simply the confidential holding companies for the family office for Mr. Liu Zhongtian.""
The companies ""simply direct all his investments out of the People's Republic of China,"" Mr. Randow wrote.
The email was sent to a business associate of Mr. Liu's in response to questions from Banque Heritage, a Swiss bank conducting due diligence on the companies as they tried to open an account.
If the bank had more questions about Mr. Liu, Mr. Randow suggested: ""Google him.""
Banque Heritage declined to comment.
Mr. Liu, through a spokeswoman, denied any involvement with Grand Provenance and Eighty Eight. Mr. Liu's main company, Liaoyang-based China Zhongwang, says it sells most of its aluminum to Chinese companies.
A U.S. attorney who has represented Mr. Liu, Charles Pok, says Mr. Liu's name was fraudulently connected to the two Swiss companies by a former U.S. business associate named Eric Shen. ""Eric Shen and Herman Randow definitely know that Mr. Liu never instructed them to establish these companies,"" Mr. Pok wrote in an email.
Munsch Hardt said the firm and Mr. Randow denied Mr. Pok's allegations. Mr. Shen also denied them.
American executives who have investigated the shifting stockpiles of metal say they suspected Mr. Liu may have been motivated in part by a desire to move wealth offshore. Even though he ultimately failed to sell large amounts of metal into the U.S., they point out that it still serves as a store of value.
Mike Rapport, who owns an aluminum business in Southern California, said an Aluminicaste salesman told him Mr. Liu planned to use the Mexican metal to fund his retirement.
Mr. Liu has made moves that indicate he may be preparing to leave China.
Last year, he paid [euro]650,000 to become a Maltese citizen, taking advantage of a new policy introduced by Malta's government in 2014, according to government records there. With Maltese citizenship, Mr. Liu can live and work in any country in the European Union. Chinese law forbids the country's citizens from holding dual citizenship.
Mr. Liu also has a Social Security number in the U.S., where his family owns several homes, according to a records search.
The China Zhongwang spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on personal matters.
In August, Zhongwang USA LLC, controlled by Mr. Liu and affiliated with China Zhongwang, agreed to acquire Cleveland-based aluminum producer Aleris Corp. for $1.1 billion, which would mark the highest price ever paid by a Chinese firm for a U.S. metals producer.

Deng's Take: Behind China's Tightened Monetary Stance; A divergence between the People's Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission came into focus in a recent speech,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1855041609?accountid=14586,"Â  China's top leadership has hinted at a slightly tightened monetary stance in 2017. But bubbling below that seemingly unified goal are long-simmering tensions among various financial regulators, each with its own thoughts on what policy measures are appropriate.
A divergence between the People's Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission came into focus in a recent speech by an official at the banking regulator.
Yu Xuejun said China should cut the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserves at the central bank, adding that other financing tools could be used to adjust liquidity after a cut, according to a report last week by state-owned Shanghai Securities News. Reducing the required reserve ratio, or RRR, would let banks lend more.
Tools like medium-term lending facilities, where the central bank agrees to lend to banks at a set rate for a few months, shouldn't be overused before a cut, Mr. Yu said.
But senior party officials at the recent Central Economic Work Conference have called for ""prudent and neutral"" policy this year. That language, shifting from ""accommodative"" in their previous statements, implies that the central bank will refrain from cutting RRR for banks, much less lower interest rates, according to analysts.
The dissonance in rhetoric lies in different regulators' priorities. The banking commission looks out for banks, which in China are buckling under a surge of bad loans coupled with slowing economic growth. The central bank looks out for the broader financial system and attempts to address risk wherever it may arise, from trying to deleverage the local bond market to curbing declines in the yuan and arresting capital flight. Increasingly, it is also taking on a coordinator role between China's various lumbering regulatory groups.
Cutting banks' reserve requirement ratios risks adding to the cash flowing out of China--the exact situation the leadership wants to prevent. The last time the central bank cut RRR was in March 2016, when it took the ratio down 0.5 percentage point to 17% for the largest banks. Since then, it has stuck with more flexible money-market instruments to adjust the supply of funds in the financial system, even though such measures are more expensive for banks.
Zhu Chaoping, an economist at UOB Kay Hian in Shanghai, said to ""expect more fine-tune measures"" this year, but not an RRR cut. The use medium- and short-term lending facilities started in 2015 and authorities are increasingly formalizing them as tools to adjust borrowing costs, he explained.
Given Mr. Yu's relatively narrow role at the banking regulator of overseeing state-owned financial institutions, his opinion might not carry much sway.
But his comments illustrate the need for more coordination between Chinese regulators. Similar policy tussles have surfaced between the central bank and National Development Reform Commission, the country's economic planner.
Unfortunately, analysts say last year's talk of consolidating regulation has fizzled out. China's undeniable message right now is stability at all costs.

Why China's Taco Bell Sells Chicken and Waffles; Yum China is bringing Taco Bell back to China--this time with a nod to local tastes,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1856229433?accountid=14586,"Â  SHANGHAI--It was lunchtime in the Lujiazui financial district, and Sally Yu was dining on fried chicken and soft-serve ice cream.
She had a taco, too, because after all she was at Taco Bell. But Ms. Yu, 30, could have easily skipped Mexican food altogether by choosing french fries or waffles to go with her chicken, perhaps with a cup of apple cider.
After almost a decadelong absence, Yum China Holdings Inc. is bringing Taco Bell back to China. But, wary that Chinese consumers may not be clamoring for beans and tortillas, it is hedging its bets with a menu that appeals to local tastes.
""Let's be honest: It's not Mexican food; it's Mexican-inspired food,"" said Greg Creed, chief executive of Yum Brands Inc., the former parent company of Yum China and owner of the Taco Bell brand.
The Taco Bell here represents the first initiative by Yum China to expand its portfolio since it was spun off last year from its U.S. parent company , which will collect 3% of Yum China's revenue as a license fee.
The Shanghai store had a soft opening last month, and company executives say they hope to open several more in other major Chinese cities this year to test the waters for a possible nationwide rollout.
If it succeeds, Taco Bell offers Yum China a chance to grow beyond its KFC and Pizza Hut chains . Those brands combined have more than 7,300 stores in China, but annual revenue in the country has been flat at about $6.9 billion since 2012.
Driving the Taco Bell initiative in China is Micky Pant, who oversaw the fast-food chain's push into international markets while at Yum Brands. Mr. Pant was named Yum China's chief executive in 2015 and has stayed on as CEO since the spinoff.
""Taco Bell has evolved very well as a brand and connects very well with millennials and younger consumers,"" Mr. Pant said. ""It was really attractive to try the best of Taco Bell in China once again.""
Yum China is the largest international fast-food chain in China, which has more KFCs than McDonald's stores. But some analysts say Mexican cuisine may be a tougher sell than fried chicken or pizza, which have shown broad appeal internationally.
In 2003, Yum opened what it called Taco Bell Grande in Shanghai and Shenzhen, offering table service and fancier food items such as enchiladas and fajitas. Servers greeted customers in large sombreros in restaurants decorated with colorful ceramics. The Louisville, Ky.-based company opened four of these stores in China before closing them all by 2008.
For the relaunch, Mr. Pant said the menu went through many changes over the past year. One insight was that Chinese diners preferred hot foods over cold, he said. ""The menu has a warmer profile than you would expect in other countries.""
Diners will find tacos filled with nacho-cheese sauce, tortilla chips that bear a closer resemblance to packaged varieties and burritos stuffed with shrimp and avocado. They won't find refried beans or grated cheddar cheese.
During tests, Chinese consumers immediately took to the quesadillas and hard-shell tacos, while rice and tortillas weren't as well received, Mr. Pant said. ""Getting it right was a combination of art and science.""
Some analysts say that this time around, Taco Bell has a better shot of connecting with Chinese consumers.
""There's an argument to be made that the people managing the brand are a little bit better,"" said Sara Senatore, a restaurant analyst at Sanford Bernstein.

Why China's Taco Bell Sells Chicken and Waffles; Yum China is bringing Taco Bell back to China--this time with a nod to local tastes,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1856368178?accountid=14586,"Â  SHANGHAI--It was lunchtime in the Lujiazui financial district, and Sally Yu was dining on fried chicken and soft-serve ice cream.
She had a taco, too, because after all she was at Taco Bell. But Ms. Yu, 30, could have easily skipped Mexican food altogether by choosing french fries or waffles to go with her chicken, perhaps with a cup of apple cider.
After almost a decadelong absence, Yum China Holdings Inc. is bringing Taco Bell back to China. But, wary that Chinese consumers may not be clamoring for beans and tortillas, it is hedging its bets with a menu that appeals to local tastes.
""Let's be honest: It's not Mexican food; it's Mexican-inspired food,"" said Greg Creed, chief executive of Yum Brands Inc., the former parent company of Yum China and owner of the Taco Bell brand.
The Taco Bell here represents the first initiative by Yum China to expand its portfolio since it was spun off last year from its U.S. parent company , which will collect 3% of Yum China's revenue as a license fee.
The Shanghai store had a soft opening last month, and company executives say they hope to open several more in other major Chinese cities this year to test the waters for a possible nationwide rollout.
If it succeeds, Taco Bell offers Yum China a chance to grow beyond its KFC and Pizza Hut chains. Those brands combined have more than 7,300 stores in China, but annual revenue in the country has been flat at about $6.9 billion since 2012.
Driving the Taco Bell initiative in China is Micky Pant, who oversaw the fast-food chain's push into international markets while at Yum Brands. Mr. Pant was named Yum China's chief executive in 2015 and has stayed on as CEO since the spinoff.
""Taco Bell has evolved very well as a brand and connects very well with millennials and younger consumers,"" Mr. Pant said. ""It was really attractive to try the best of Taco Bell in China once again.""
Yum China is the largest international fast-food chain in China, which has more KFCs than McDonald's stores. But some analysts say Mexican cuisine may be a tougher sell than fried chicken or pizza, which have shown broad appeal internationally.
In 2003, Yum opened what it called Taco Bell Grande in Shanghai and Shenzhen, offering table service and fancier food items such as enchiladas and fajitas. Servers in large sombreros greeted customers in restaurants decorated with colorful ceramics. The Louisville, Ky.-based company opened four of these stores in China before closing them all by 2008.
For the relaunch, Mr. Pant said the menu went through many changes over the past year. One insight was that Chinese diners preferred hot foods over cold, he said. ""The menu has a warmer profile than you would expect in other countries.""
Diners will find tacos filled with nacho-cheese sauce, tortilla chips that bear a closer resemblance to packaged varieties and burritos stuffed with shrimp and avocado. They won't find refried beans or grated cheddar cheese.
During tests, Chinese consumers immediately took to the quesadillas and hard-shell tacos, while rice and tortillas weren't as well received, Mr. Pant said. ""Getting it right was a combination of art and science.""
Some analysts say that this time around, Taco Bell has a better shot of connecting with Chinese consumers.
""There's an argument to be made that the people managing the brand are a little bit better,"" said Sara Senatore, a restaurant analyst at Sanford Bernstein. She noted that Taco Bell had a false start in India but is thriving there since a 2010 relaunch. It helps that Mr. Pant has experience taking Taco Bell to other countries, including India, Ms. Senatore said.

"China's Military Ambitions Likely Extend Beyond Asia, Pentagon Says; Pentagon report expressed continued U.S. concern over China role in South China Sea where smaller neighbors have competing resource claims","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1906274324?accountid=14586,"Corrections & Amplifications
A Pentagon report on China's military said China would likely build a base in Pakistan or other countries with which it has a longstanding relationship. The initial version of this article published Tuesday said the report didn't specify where a base could be built.
WASHINGTON--China's construction of a military base in Djibouti, closely watched by the U.S., may be a precursor to other projects outside of its neighborhood, such as in Pakistan, according to a new Pentagon report on China's military.
The annual report, required by Congress, has focused in past years on China's military operations in the South China Sea, where it has been building artificial islands and developing other land features in an island chain known as the Spratlys. There, China is more focused on enhancing infrastructure, developing an airfield and other facilities, according to the report.
Last year, Beijing began building a military base in the East African nation of Djibouti, which is also host to a U.S. base, Camp Lemonnier.
""China likely will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has longstanding, friendly relationships,"" the report said. The Chinese military's ""evolving focus"", the report said, reflects its ""expanding interest in a wider operational reach,"" according to the report.
Pakistan was the most likely country where China would establish a base, the report said.
Chinese officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Pentagon released the annual report on China's military power just days after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis appeared together in Sydney, where Mr. Tillerson said Beijing hasn't done enough for stability in the region. The U.S. has increasingly pushed China to lean on North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
""China is a significant economic and trading power, and we desire a productive relationship, but we cannot allow China to use its economic power to buy its way out of other problems, whether it is militarizing islands in the South China Sea or its failure to put appropriate failure on North Korea,"" Mr. Tillerson said Monday in Sydney.
The Pentagon report expressed continued U.S. concern over China's role in the South China Sea, where smaller neighbors--including the Philippines, a U.S. ally--have competing resource claims.
""In 2016, China focused its main effort on infrastructure construction at its outposts on the Spratly Islands,"" the report said. That activity gives China ""persistent civil-military bases to enhance its presence in the South China Sea and improve China's ability to control the features and nearby maritime space,"" according to the report.
The report also noted with unease that China's military has modernized at a fast pace. ""China's military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advantages,"" the report said.
China has been investing in hardware such as hypersonic missiles, directed energy weapons and space-based weapons systems, according to U.S. officials. That concerns Adm. Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, who testified in April that such developments should be seen as alarming. The U.S. is unable to match the development of China's hypersonic missiles because such missiles are banned under the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
The treaty was signed in 1987 between the U.S. and Soviet Union, binding no other countries, and prohibits the land-based deployment of missiles of intermediate range.
""Hypersonics that can match the Chinese weapons would be precluded by the INF,"" Adm. Harris told a House panel in April. ""So we're precluded from developing land-based weapons that can match the Chinese land-based weapons by treaty.""
The report said China, to support its modernization, ""uses a variety of methods to acquire foreign military and dual-use technologies, including cybertheft, targeted foreign direct investment and exploitation of the access of private Chinese nationals to such technologies.
The U.S. relationship with China has long been complex, but has grown more complicated in recent months with the increased belligerence from North Korea.
The country's missile launches, now somewhat more routine, have added to the region's strategic complexity. As recently as last year, the U.S. was focused on encouraging China to halt its militarization of the islands in the South China Sea.
But Washington now emphasizes its efforts to persuade Beijing to pressure North Korea to stop its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, while also working to counter China's claims in the Spratlys.
The Pentagon conducted its first freedom of navigation operation under the Trump administration in the South China Sea late last month.

"The Rising Stakes for Tesla in China; Given China's increasing importance to Tesla, Elon Musk's silence about a China strategy is a glaring omission","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1906330828?accountid=14586,"China has become a big part of Tesla, even if Elon Musk hasn't said much about it.
The electric-car maker is in many ways out of sync with its peers in the world's largest electric-car market. Unlike GM, Volkswagen and Ford, it doesn't have a local joint venture partner or a local dealer network to plug into. Its battery chargers don't comport with China's national standard. It doesn't produce locally, so its sticker prices are burdened with a 25% import tax in addition to the cost of shipping cars over.
Yet it has found some success. Revenue tripled last year and represents almost a fifth of the company's total. It attracted a big Chinese investor in Tencent, which took a 5% stake in March, giving it local credibility and contacts. Shortly thereafter, Chinese state media tweeted a picture of Mr. Musk and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang in Beijing. Talk started swirling of a Tesla factory in China, which would end the import tax and possibly qualify Tesla for generous subsidies on which Chinese rivals such as BYD thrive. It boasts an ever-expanding list of its so-called supercharger stations in China.
The question is, will whatever strategy Tesla is using to win those sales continue to work as it introduces its mass-market Model 3? Tesla hasn't said when next year it will launch the Model 3 in China and doesn't disclose sales margins there. Mr. Musk has said almost nothing in presentations or earnings calls about the China strategy, a glaring omission given China's increasing importance.
Tesla may already be hitting a rough patch there. Based on customs data, research firm JL Warren Capital figures first-quarter shipments were down 15%, a trend that continued in April. Meanwhile, inventory built up. The number of vehicles sitting at dealerships in March and April was close to the highest ever for Tesla in China--almost 5,000, a substantial count for a company that imported fewer than 12,000 vehicles last year.
Tesla has been leaning on marketing tactics that will likely be short-lived. It has raised prices twice over the past year, both times announcing the increase was imminent--which may pull demand forward, but is no way to generate new demand. It has offered discounted insurance--50% off for cars bought at a Tesla store--as well as perks like free charging across the country for a limited time.
Scalability is an issue. Tesla's success in big cities has been underpinned by another tactic: arranging coveted license plates for buyers. Plate issuance is restricted to reduce pollution and congestion, so including them with the purchase has given Tesla an edge, though not an unassailable one.
Mr. Musk has hinted at times the company could reveal plans about China production. Given Tesla's ambitions--and its lofty stock price--such a plan could carry serious importance.

China: USS McCain Collision Shows U.S. Naval Patrols Are Threat to Safety; China's Foreign Ministry warns of danger posed to safety of navigation in South China Sea,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1930699577?accountid=14586,"BEIJING--China's response to a U.S. warship's collision with a cargo vessel off Singapore carried a vibe of vindication for its past warnings about a rising American military presence in Asian waters.
Beijing, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, has long said the increase in U.S. naval traffic in those waters, including exercises and freedom-of-navigation patrols that challenge Chinese territorial claims, pose a threat to maritime safety.
News that the guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with a merchant ship early Monday--the second such accident in Asian waters in just over two months--prompted Chinese officials and state media to air concerns and criticism over American naval operations in the region.
Asked about the mishap, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry on Monday expressed ""hope that the missing are safe,"" but flagged Beijing's concerns about ""the threat and hidden danger posed by the relevant incident to the safety of navigation in the South China Sea and relevant waters.""
Some Chinese state media echoed the Foreign Ministry's sentiment in commentaries about the collision.
In a Monday editorial, the English-language China Daily accused the U.S. Navy of becoming ""a dangerous obstacle in Asian waters,"" while claiming that Beijing has ""boosted navigational safety by constructing five lighthouses on its islands"" in the South China Sea.
""Anyone should be able to tell who is to blame for militarizing the waters and posing a threat to navigation,"" the newspaper said.
Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, published English and Chinese-language editorials decrying what it saw as the U.S. Navy's arrogant behavior, saying its vessels ""patrol too frequently"" in the Asia-Pacific region and lack ""respect for huge merchant ships.""
""The frequent collisions of U.S. warships with merchant vessels offer a warning to the Americans that they should restrain themselves,"" said the Global Times, published by the Communist Party's official newspaper People's Daily.
On Chinese social media, some users greeted the news of the McCain's collision with an air of schadenfreude.
""What goes around, comes around,"" wrote a blogger named Long Kaifeng on the Weibo microblogging service. ""The U.S. military has long pushed for the freedom to run wild and run amok on the world's oceans, and hence keeps colliding with cargo ships. It's retribution.""
Some Chinese observers, however, urged their compatriots not to gloat.
""We shouldn't mock the U.S. Navy. Every navy is currently studying how to ensure that vessels and crews, while under great work pressure, can focus and function properly when making urgent evasive maneuvers,"" wrote Song Xiaojun, a Beijing-based commentator on military affairs and a former naval officer, on his official Weibo microblog.
As China's navy ""increases overseas activities, we also have many young researchers studying this subject,"" Mr. Song wrote.
""Accidents at sea are part and parcel of naval operations,"" said Shi Yinhong, an international-relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing. ""The Pentagon wouldn't make any major adjustments to its military deployments just because of a few accidents.""
""All this incident reflects is the increased frequency of U.S. naval operations in the South China Sea, which brings with it increased risk of mishaps,"" Mr. Shi said.

"S & P Lowers China's Credit Rating; The rating and the view of risks in China now match those of Moody's, which lowered China's rating in May, and Fitch, which did so in 2013","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1940862453?accountid=14586,"BEIJING--Standard & Poor's became the last of the three major rating agencies to lower its view on China's creditworthiness, a move that came as China has taken forceful measures to tamp down risks and emphasize stability.
The timing of the move, just weeks ahead of a sensitive Communist Party leadership transition, was likely to be an irritant for Beijing, and raised eyebrows among some economists and investors.
In a statement Thursday, S&P said the downgrade, to A+ from AA-, reflected its assessment that ""a prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased China's economic and financial risks."" The rating and the view of risks in China now match those of Moody's Investors Service,
which lowered China's rating in May , and Fitch Ratings, which did so in 2013.
""The S&P conclusion isn't exactly head-slapping news to the market or Chinese regulators,"" said David Loevinger, a managing director at fund manager TCW in Los Angeles. ""It's a bit ironic given that China's fundamentals are the strongest they've been in two years,"" Mr. Loevinger added.
China's economy expanded 6.9% in the first half of the year, well above Beijing's 2017 growth target, though recent data indicate that higher borrowing costs are starting to have an effect on business activity.
""The timing is awkward for China's leaders,"" said Mark Williams, chief China economist at Capital Economics. It is ""arguably questionable on the basis of recent economic and financial developments,"" he wrote in a note following the S&P move.
An S&P spokesman declined to comment on questions about the timing of the rating agency's action.
In a bid to keep the economy on an even keel ahead of the power transition, Beijing has moved aggressively to rein in rampant borrowings this year. Regulators from the central bank to the top banking, securities and insurance watchdogs have taken steps to reduce banks' lending to each other or to other financial firms, which had been among the main sources of risk for the country's financial system.
The result: Credit growth in China, as measured by M2, a broad gauge of money supply, hit a low last month. Officials at the People's Bank of China say slowing M2 growth could be a ""new normal"" thanks to Beijing's resolve to keep a lid on leverage.
However, S&P raises a valid concern about China's credit continuing to expand faster than output, economists and analysts say. That reflects more loans going into supporting loss-making firms, such as state-owned steelmakers, as opposed to more productive areas. Such continued misallocation of resources raises the specter of a prolonged economic downturn down the line.
""Given the high levels of debt in China, this doesn't look like it is unreasonable,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. ""The downgrade is not putting China in the basket-case territory,"" he added. With the downgrade, China now has the same long-term S&P rating as Japan, Ireland and Israel.
Chinese officials have maintained that Beijing has the ability to control its debt growth and prevent systemic risks. The Ministry of Finance didn't respond to requests for comment late Thursday to the S&P move.
China opened the credit spigot during the 2008 global financial crisis, a move that helped shield it from the economic malaise afflicting much of the rest of the world, and debt levels have continued to balloon in order to prop up growth. The Institute of International Finance estimates that China's overall debt load will reach nearly 300% of its gross domestic product by the end of this year, up from less than 180% at the end of 2008.
Corporate debt is projected to make up about 169% of GDP by the end of 2017, followed by government debt at 47%, according to the institute. In recent years, Chinese families have also increased their borrowings, with households' debt-to-GDP ratio set to increase to 45% by the end of this year from less than 40% two years ago, it said.
In its statement Thursday, S&P said recent government efforts to rein in leverage could stabilize ""the trend of financial risk"" in the medium term. But ""credit growth in the next two to three years will remain at levels that will increase financial risks gradually,"" the agency said.
Market reaction to the move, announced after the close of China's stock markets, was muted with little movement in the yuan, which edged down 0.3% against the dollar in mainland trading. The action also did little to damp foreign appetite for a $7.6 billion capital-raising effort by a large state-owned Chinese bank.
Postal Savings Bank of China Co., the country's sixth-largest bank by assets, was in the midst of taking orders for its new offshore preference shares when S&P cut China's rating. Despite the downgrade, strong investor demand for the deal led bankers to lower guidance for the securities' yield to 4.55%, from 4.85% earlier in the day.
Going forward, some analysts say, the downgrade could make it more expensive for Chinese companies seeking to sell bonds overseas though it likely will have limited impact on China's domestic bond market. Most bonds traded on the mainland are owned by Chinese banks, insurers and other domestic entities.
""The risk is actually mitigating,"" said UBS China economist Wang Tao.

China Looks After Itself With Its Korea Policy; China lets North Korea do China's dirty work to make troubles for America.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1977872601?accountid=14586,"I agree 100% with Daniel Nidess in ""What Is China's Angle in North Korea "" (op-ed, Dec. 6.) North Korea is the second-best thing that has happened to China. The first being American manufacturing shifting to its shores. China lets North Korea do China's dirty work to make trouble for America. And it is hard to believe that North Korea has developed its strong nuclear capability without any assistance from China. It is wrong to assume that China fears a humanitarian catastrophe along its border with North Korea. China has bulldozed its own villages as well as urban communities without any compassion, just compensation or repercussions. China will be even more brutal to any possible refugee influx from North Korea.
I have no doubt that China's goal is to replace U.S. influence not only in east Asia, but in all of Asia and eventually to become the global superpower. What has puzzled me all these years is why successive U.S. administrations have not only ignored China's goals but actually facilitated them. We have continuously tolerated China's human-rights violations and lately have even stopped raising the issue. We have been stupid to tolerate China's intellectual property violations and unfair trade policies which have resulted in millions of manufacturing job losses in America.

It's Time for China's Property Developers to Quit Gambling; The likes of China Evergrande have performed well as China's property market boomed. But their high leverage could haunt them now as prices cool.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1988884310?accountid=14586,"Chinese house prices have been booming for two years and shares of the country's home builders--which have made big leveraged bets on the market--have likewise been on a tear. The question now, as the market shows signs of cooling, is: Should they hold or fold?
Some of the sector's best performers are also the most indebted. Shares in China Evergrande, which sits on net debt of $63 billion, have surged nearly six times in value since the beginning of 2017. Likewise, Sunac China's shares have risen more than five times in the same period. Its net debt is equivalent to four times its equity, while the ratio is 240% for Evergrande. The average for U.S. real-estate firms, by contrast, is 96%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Chinese developers have loaded up on borrowing in the past few years to gobble up land or property projects. Betting the house on the housing market has been a winner so far. The boom--especially in smaller cities where local governments have provided support by buying up apartments--has allowed them to offload their properties quickly at a rising price. Evergrande, for example, sold 2.5 times more apartments last year than it did in 2015.
There have been signs of developers deleveraging . Evergrande raised a total of $20 billion last year by selling about a third of its property business in three rounds--the latest in November. Sunac raised $1 billion from issuing new shares last month.
More remedial action will be needed if the cooling of China's housing market continues. Data this week showed housing prices in China ticked up slightly in December; but growth is much slower now than a year ago, and prices are heading down in major markets such as Beijing. Lower revenues mean developers will have to reduce their already sky-high debt-servicing costs: Evergrande's interest bill in the first half of last year was equal to about half its operating profit, for example. The company has reported negative operating cash flow ever since it was listed in 2009.
The worry for investors should be that--as any gambling addicts could tell you--old habits die hard.

But they reflected the tremors of their time, after the United Nations ""police action"" in Korea had spun beyond control, engulfing U.S.-led forces in a massive ground war with China--the same China that less than a decade earlier had been a U.S. ally.
What had Marshall, the now almost universally admired U.S. Army chief of staff who had contributed so much to victory in World War II, supposedly done wrong? He had dared and failed in something grand. In December 1945, he went to China as a special envoy of President Harry Truman in an attempt to broker peace between Chiang Kai-shek's governing Nationalists and Mao Zedong's insurgent Communists. In the end, though striving mightily, Marshall failed. As Mao drove Chiang and his forces to Taiwan and unified the mainland under Communist tyranny, his good name back home fell into a snake pit of paranoiac partisanship.
In ""The China Mission,"" Daniel Kurtz-Phelan, the executive editor of Foreign Affairs, skillfully tells the story of Marshall's quixotic and forlorn diplomatic initiative. Deeply researched and written with verve, the book ought to be read by any U.S. foreign-policy maker practicing diplomacy in Asia. Marshall's oft-forgotten experience in Asia has been covered before, notably in Forrest C. Pogue's four-volume life (1963-87). But Mr. Kurtz-Phelan has performed a service in reviving this important episode with such aplomb, rigor and pace.
Three days before Christmas 1945, Marshall arrived at a small stone bungalow in Chongqing to begin a series of parleys aimed at ending 18 years of civil war. After an eight-year hiatus following the Japanese invasion in 1937, the conflict had resumed with a vengeance.
While there was idealism in Marshall's heart--he was gravely concerned about the famine confronting ordinary Chinese people--power politics justified the effort too. Without a strong, unified China, Washington calculated, the Soviet Union could assert control of Manchuria, which it was already infiltrating and pillaging for industrial capital and infrastructure. Truman and Marshall believed a negotiated peace could serve American interests at home and abroad. Yet the American people in 1946 had little patience for expensive foreign projects.
Doggedly pushing through thickets of disagreement, Marshall won a quick cease-fire pact between Chiang and Mao's emissary, Zhou Enlai. Chiang had come to the table because his extermination campaign against Communist forces failed once they retreated into China's hinterlands. Though Mao professed to be a ""Soviet pupil,"" Stalin had humbled him, signing a peace treaty with Chiang's government.
The China Mission
By Daniel Kurtz-Phelan
Norton, 476 pages, $28.95
On Jan. 22 Marshall handed Chiang a draft bill of rights, a procedure for a constitution and a plan for interim coalition government. He followed this up by securing an understanding to unify the rival Chinese armies under Chiang's national leadership. ""Marshall had achieved what even cynics were calling a miracle,"" Mr. Kurtz-Phelan writes.
Praising him breathlessly were not only American journalists, who believed peace in their time was finally at hand, but his Chinese hosts as well. Chiang's emissary called Marshall the midwife of unification, the leading strategist of the world and an ambassador of peace. Thus the American general departed Mao's headquarters on March 5, 1946, flattered and hopeful.
But a stronger geopolitical tide was rising. On that very same day, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill gave his ""Iron Curtain"" speech in Missouri. America had already resolved to contain Soviet Communism, of course. And the previous June, the U.S. War Department had concluded that the ""Chinese Communists are Communists,"" in league with the movement directed from the Kremlin.
The three-man ""truce teams"" dispatched throughout China to effect the cease-fire soon encountered difficulty. Both Chinese sides considered the negotiations a stratagem for improving their position on the battlefield before the peace terms froze the lines in place. The cease-fire provided a rationale to press disputes that kept the fighting going.
Mr. Kurtz-Phelan's brisk narrative handles all this as a compelling drama. He adeptly paints his characters as more than mere avatars of political positions. Zhou was polished and gracious, a talented actor and dissembler who had become a communist in Paris, where he learned to debate with the best the Sorbonne had to offer. With a ""personality full of mobility,"" he engaged Marshall with relish about ""Lincoln's spirit of freedom and Washington's spirit of independence."" One of Marshall's aides thought Zhou ""could run General Motors.""
Mao himself needed the talents of Zhou in order to play Marshall, for the Communist leader was by his own admission emotional, arrogant and quick to point fingers. Mao's strength was his mystical sense of himself and a massively ambitious ego fueled by the resentments of his upbringing.
Marshall emerges in ""The China Mission"" as a figure of considerable sympathy. Mr. Kurtz-Phelan shows him as a devout public servant, a consummate professional and a sincere idealist who relied upon the good faith of all with whom he dealt. He could command a room yet conveyed ""abject humility."" His Olympian calm coexisted with what the author calls ""a reputation for truth-telling, for an almost insolent integrity in rooms of yes-men."" He was less a battlefield leader than a superlative organization man. In World War I he had spoken truth to power--to Gen. John Pershing, who promptly made Marshall his aide. In World War II, his talents had helped defeat Hitler and Hirohito. But the problem of China, in the end, was beyond him.
His warm personal relationships with Chiang and Zhou did not seem to matter. Culture was part of it--at every turn, the American was desperate to make a deal. But the Chinese civil war had a momentum, a ruthlessness, all its own. The talents that made Marshall an effective leader in Allied war councils doomed him to failure with his cynical Chinese counterparts. ""Each side overplayed its hand when momentum seemed to be in its favor and them came back to negotiate when the momentum had shifted, at which point the other side was no longer interested,"" the author writes.
Before Marshall knew it, American troops stationed in China to oversee an orderly repatriation of Japanese troops were caught in the rekindled civil war. Marshall pressed on nonetheless. Unable to parse the murky relationship between Mao and Stalin, he gambled on good faith, hoping for the best. An honest broker trapped in a wicked game, Marshall was in the end whipsawed by cultural and political forces beyond his ken.
By November 1946, Marshall was all but finished. More than two-thirds of his truce teams had been recalled to headquarters for reasons of their safety. With Truman's domestic poll numbers in the tank, the midterm elections saw a Republican sweep of Congress. Marshall flew back to Honolulu two months later, never to return.
His failure inadvertently offered up America as a scapegoat for the continuing misery of ordinary Chinese. The Communists exploited it to the hilt. Chiang, meanwhile, believing that Republicans were more sympathetic to him, was counting on the 1948 presidential vote to save his cause. But his reading of U.S. politics was no keener than Marshall's reading of China's. With a fatal overconfidence, and poor counsel, Chiang saw his Nationalist forces stretched thin, too heavily outfitted to pursue Mao's guerrillas into the hills. The same day Chiang's armies finally lost Manchuria, Truman won a close re-election.
Chiang's collapse produced an opening for McCarthyites in Washington to push back against Marshall's idealism. The general returned home to vicious gossip. ""There have been rumblings and rumors around Washington to the effect that you have been taken in by the Chinese Communists,"" his colleague Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer told him.
The Marshall Mission was, by any standard, a failure. The 13 months of frenetic negotiation led to all-out war, and a Communist government in Beijing that vexes America to this day. The question is whether it had any chance of succeeding at all. After World War II, with the U.S. carrying out a massive demobilization (Truman preferred the term ""disintegration""), failure was probably foreordained. Mr. Kurtz-Phelan's book is valuable for its reminder that diplomacy is futile when it is backed only by the frail regiment of hope.
When a chastened Marshall, as Truman's secretary of state, turned his attention to Europe, he found that change and peace were possible in war-torn regions of the world. The success of the Marshall Plan was a godsend for the ravaged continent and a boon for America too. But U.S. largesse toward Europe summoned forth hungry supplicants around the world. When Chiang's ambassador in Washington said there should be a Marshall Plan for China--his chorus of supporters posited the existence of a racist double standard--Marshall could only laugh. Mr. Kurtz-Phelan does so right along with him. ""Predictions by American diplomats and journalists that the Chinese Communists would turn into mere 'agrarian democrats' proved laughable."" Mao's victory made it possible for Stalin to approve North Korea's invasion of South Korea.
We know how the movie ends: the Communists in control by 1949, Chiang defeated and exiled to Taiwan, a customer of American arms. After Moscow tested a hydrogen bomb and war broke out on the Korean peninsula, the Cold War hit full stride.

"China, China, China: Beijing Cuts Reserves, but Investors Yawn; Asian stocks largely dropped on Monday","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2058402145?accountid=14586,"Asian stocks mostly fell on Monday, led by a 0.8% drop in Taiwan's Taiex index.
Monday's Big Theme
It's all about China, again. The People's Bank of China said Sunday it will cut the amount of reserves banks are required to keep with the central bank, which will free up more than $100 billion for commercial banks to boost lending and restructure debt.
What's Happening
The news is hitting the yuan, which is sliding against the dollar and has now erased its year-to-date gain, according to Wind Info.
One dollar bought 6.5301 yuan recently, which means the Chinese currency has lost 0.5% against the greenback for the day. It has now slipped 0.3% for the year.
But the central bank's announcement didn't boost the Shanghai Composite in a big way. The index flipped between slight gains and losses on Monday, rising 0.2% in recent trade. That's not much compared with how it reacted after the central bank made similar cuts in the past.
The Shanghai Composite rose 0.8% on April 18, the day after the PBOC said it planned to reduce the amount of reserves held by commercial banks.
The index also added 0.8% on Oct. 9, the first day of trading after the bank had announced a targeted required-reserves cut on Sept. 30. Chinese markets were closed for the local Golden Week holiday in between.
While the cut in banks' reserve requirement ratio should be positive for stocks, the prospect of a trade war with the U.S. and the slowing momentum of China's own economy continue to weigh on the market. In the latest sign of rising tensions, President Donald Trump plans to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech firms .
Market Reaction
""It's not so easy to rebuild confidence in a market which has just recorded a fresh two-year low and broken the key 3000 level it had tried to defend for half a year,"" said Zhang Yanbing, senior analyst at Zheshang Securities Co.
The Shanghai index has dropped for five straight weeks through Friday, putting it on the edge of a bear market. Despite the increasingly attractive valuations of Chinese stocks, ""investors' sentiment remains quite weak at the moment,"" Mr. Zhang said.
Another reason why the central-bank news hasn't lifted stocks? ""The PBOC did not surprise anyone,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for greater China at ANZ in Hong Kong, pointing to a notice from the country's State Council last week flagging the move.
Ultimately, the central bank's latest credit easing may continue to have more of an impact on the yuan.
""The fact that the RRR cut came ahead of Trump's move slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods shows that the authorities are now willing to let the yuan slide a bit more,"" said a Shanghai-based senior currency trader at a mid-sized Chinese bank.
Elsewhere
Brent crude fell 1.8% on Monday, dwarfing the 0.3% pullback in U.S. oil prices. Oil prices rallied Friday after the some of the world's biggest oil producers agreed to boost crude output less than many investors had expected.

James Dobbins argues that this is exactly Beijing's long-term plan (""The Global Order Will Outlast U.S. Leadership ,"" op-ed, July 25). Mr. Dobbins overestimates China's ability to structure the global order to its economic and political benefit.
While it is certainly true that Chinese state-controlled financial institutions are investing enormous financial capital into public infrastructure projects around the world, Beijing's strong-arm tactics aren't winning the country any friends. China has weaponized loans and engaged in predatory trade agreements, all of which are causing consternation among many of its neighbors. When governments are unable to repay their debts to Chinese banks, Beijing leverages its financial position to attain strategic facilities as a form of compensation. Just ask Sri Lanka, which handed over a critical port to the Chinese to alleviate its debt crisis.
Mr. Dobbins also assumes that countries in Asia would simply succumb to Beijing's wishes. The evidence is the opposite; Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines are all united against China's reclamation project in the South and East China Seas. South Korea refused to demobilize the Thaad missile defense system despite Chinese sanctions on South Korean firms. Japan, increasingly recoiling from what it considers Chinese expansionism, is discussing the need to boost its own defense budget. These actions aren't the signs of docile countries accepting the inevitability of Chinese hegemony.

"'Red China's Green Revolution' Review: The Commune Revisited; In this revisionist history, Mao's collective farms spurred an agricultural revolution that laid the foundation for China's current success. Gerard Gayou reviews ""Red China's Green Revolution"" by Joshua Eisenman.","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2095966304?accountid=14586,"In December 1978, 18 starving farmers from the Chinese village of Xiaogang, desperate to escape the constraints of collective farming, compacted to divide their communal land into individual plots. Each farmer would tend to a single plot, and from his harvest contribute his share to the collective, keeping for himself whatever surplus he might reap. Within a year, village output soared.
It's a powerful tale of peasants outsmarting autocrats and an irresistible allegory of market reforms in China. To scholars and government officials, the Xiaogang pact introduced the profit motive to comrades starving for one. It was the spark that Deng Xiaoping would use to propel his country to almost 10% average GDP growth over the next three decades.
In his revisionist ""Red China's Green Revolution,"" Joshua Eisenman plays spoiler to that narrative, challenging what the Xiaogang story presupposes. He argues that, far from being doomed to low productivity and poor accountability, the Mao-era communes, in particular during the decade from 1970 to 1979, paralleled a period of great productivity in China--grain production grew by more than 50%, the number of pigs on farms increased more than 80% and life expectancy increased by almost five years. This would hardly have been possible with a dysfunctional collective farming system.
Red China's Green Revolution
By Joshua Eisenman Columbia, 436 pages, $35
The story starts in 1958 with the catastrophic Great Leap Forward. Mao Zedong had envisioned a commune system built on mass mobilization, in which millions of farmers would build infrastructure, launch industry and boost crops by sheer numbers and political zeal. It was meant to spearhead a frantic push toward agricultural modernization within a decade. Instead, it led to widespread famine: From 1958 to 1962, some 30 million Chinese died of hunger.
Mr. Eisenman's analysis here agrees with the common consensus: Communist orthodoxy proved a poor substitute for genuine expertise, and communes languished under entitlement programs detached from individual productivity. Massive collective-action problems ensued--the slackers earned as much as the hard workers, which encouraged more slacking. This only exacerbated misdirection from the top: "" 'Redness,' including political zeal, enthusiasm for the collective, and class background,"" Mr. Eisenman writes, ""was prized over technical knowledge and experience.""
But in a bold second look at one of history's most infamous institutions, Mr. Eisenman argues that in the decade following the famine, Mao's government learned from the tragedy and effectively reformed the commune system. ""Economic performance was unquestionably placed at the fore,"" the author tells us, ""and ideology was employed to encourage productivity."" From then on, ""a worker's industriousness and expertise became prime determinants of his or her redness.""
Among the reforms that dramatically improved productivity were the ""three freedoms,"" which allowed households to grow food on side plots, make products for cottage industries and create small local markets at which to sell these products. Handicrafts, silk and firewood were common sideline staples. By 1962, three years after Beijing introduced these markets to stem the famine, roughly ""one-quarter of all rural commodity transactions"" were conducted at such marketplaces. In the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan, the value of household farming ""exceeded collective farming.""
By the 1970s, according to Mr. Eisenman, China's communes were humming and its workers productive. It's an image that contrasts sharply with the conventional wisdom of monolithic work camps subject to the whims of Mao and teetering on the brink of collapse.
Mr. Eisenman instead argues that the commune's eventual demise--known as decollectivization, beginning in 1979--was a top-down directive from Deng Xiaoping, who had just emerged victorious after a yearslong battle to succeed Mao. A wily political operator, Deng harnessed the goal of economic growth and began attacking the commune system as its main impediment. By condemning Mao's ideology and increasing household autonomy, Deng unleashed a tide of private consumption, winning for himself widespread popular support and sweeping away both his political rivals and the country's erstwhile collective ethos.
As for the higher agricultural output during Deng's early years, Mr. Eisenman contends that communes were still reaping the benefits of Mao's agricultural investments even after decollectivization. Investment in agriculture was eventually squeezed, however, to 10% of total collective investment in 1988 from nearly 40% in 1982. With less capital and labor to work the farms, coupled with Deng's support for mass urbanization, the prospects for Mao's long sought-after agricultural modernization were quickly diminished.
In his book, Mr. Eisenman, an assistant professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, relies in part on original data he gathered in China. He concedes that the Mao era is a sort of ""black box"" for accurate statistics, but insists that Chinese officials were more likely to underreport productivity, as overreporting would have required a heavier contribution to the collective. The author also argues that, despite China's addition of 158 million people during the 1970s, no famine was reported among its population. Something must have been going right.
Moral objections inevitably surface with a thesis as provocative as Mr. Eisenman's. It's reasonable to suspect that any economic system could yield some production if you stretched people far enough, long enough and mercilessly enough. How much longer could China's communes have lasted, given that a willful smothering of the human spirit was doubtless as important to the commune's ""success"" as the right combination of capital inputs and institutional reforms?
Mr. Eisenman calls for readers to look anew at one of the darker periods of human history. It's a worthy intellectual exercise and a useful check on lazy approaches to China's modern history. But the result hardly casts doubt on Deng's decision to usher in more economic, political and moral freedoms.

"China's Sovereign-Wealth Fund Interested in Buying HNA's Deutsche Bank Stake; Others expressing interest include Chinese state-owned financial institutions Citic Group, China Merchants Group and China Everbright Group","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2102398354?accountid=14586,"China's sovereign-wealth fund and other large investors have expressed interest in potentially buying shares in Deutsche Bank AG from embattled Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co., according to people familiar with the matter.
HNA, which is one of Deutsche Bank's largest shareholders, is planning to unload its entire 7.6% stake in the German bank as part of a plan to shrink its global footprint, the Journal previously reported.
The potential buyers that were recently in contact with HNA include state-backed fund China Investment Corp., as well as Chinese state-owned financial institutions Citic Group, China Merchants Group and China Everbright Group, the people said. Some European and U.S. investors have also inquired about HNA's stake in Deutsche Bank, they added.
The airlines-to-hotels conglomerate is reversing a $40 billion global acquisition spree in which HNA took stakes in banks, airports, office buildings and other assets around the world. Chinese authorities, uncomfortable with HNA's rapid expansion and heavy debt load, have ordered the group to focus on running Chinese airlines and related businesses , The Wall Street Journal reported last week.
The recent talks HNA has had about its Deutsche Bank stake are at a preliminary stage and may not result in any deal, people familiar with the matter said. No formal sales process has begun, some of the people added. A sale could be complicated because HNA's shares are tied up in derivatives agreements with banks.
HNA has been one of Deutsche Bank's largest shareholders since early 2017. The relationship between the two firms has been tense at times , partly because the Chinese group borrowed billions of dollars to finance its share purchases and used derivatives to hedge its position. Some investors and executives therefore saw HNA as a speculative investor. Still, an HNA-nominated member of Deutsche Bank's supervisory board, Alexander SchÃ¼tz, received shareholder support in May for re-election to a five-year term.
Other investors previously held discussions with HNA about acquiring its Deutsche Bank shares. Earlier this year, Cerberus Capital Management LP--which disclosed a roughly 3% stake in Deutsche Bank last November--contemplated increasing its stake and held discussions with HNA about acquiring the Chinese group's shares, according to people briefed on the discussions.
Instead, Cerberus became a paid adviser to the German lender, The Wall Street Journal reported in July. Cerberus is restricted from buying or selling Deutsche Bank shares while in that role, according to people familiar with the consulting arrangement.
Deutsche Bank first disclosed early last year that HNA was a significant shareholder. The Chinese conglomerate ultimately built a stake of close to 10% using derivatives contracts with banks as part of more than $2.8 billion in financing it obtained. When some of the contracts matured, lenders sold shares to recoup what they were owed, whittling down HNA's ownership to about 7.6% currently. Deutsche shares have fallen about 42% since early 2017, valuing that stake at roughly $1.74 billion.
HNA could let the rest of its Deutsche Bank stake similarly roll off over the next 18 months when the rest of its financing arrangements expire, the Journal previously reported. That would result in a loss for the Chinese firm because the shares are worth less than what the firm bought them for.
If it were to sell its Deutsche Bank stake before the contracts mature, HNA would likely have to pay a fee to banks to exit the arrangements early, according to people familiar with the matter. But a sale could be attractive if HNA gets an offer that would enable it to recoup more money, one of the people said.

Can Tesla Drive Out of the Slow Lane in China? The electric car company has suffered amid U.S.-China trade tensions.

Its plan to move into the fast lane may not go smoothly.
The electric car maker has been one of the biggest victims of China-U.S. trade tensions, ever since Beijing raised the tariff on cars imported from the U.S. to 45% from 25% in July. Unlike many American car makers that have factories in China, Tesla's cars are made solely in the U.S. That means a Tesla sold in China is around 60% more expensive than one sold back home. Tesla vehicle imports into China dropped from around 1,500 a month in the first half to around 260 a month on average in July and August, according to data collected by JL Warren Capital.
To drive around that pothole, Tesla plans to build its first factory in China--its second-largest market, accounting for around 17% of sales last year. The auto maker bought a 210-acre plot in Shanghai this week to build a factory it says could eventually produce up to 500,000 cars a year . In turn, Tesla could become the first foreign car maker to have a wholly owned factory in China.
First it will need to find some cash . Tesla boss Elon Musk said in August that the Chinese factory will cost around $2 billion, though Goldman Sachs, for example, reckons total costs could amount to $4 billion to $5 billion. Tesla will need to raise that cash on top of refinancing $4.3 billion of its existing borrowings coming due by 2020.
Tesla expects what it calls ""local debt"" to fund much of the initial investment in its China plant, although who those local lenders might be is unclear. The Chinese government, which is eager to push its own electric-vehicle industry, may be interested in chipping in. It could, though, demand a steep price, such as forcing Tesla to transfer some of its technology.
Assuming everything works out--a big assumption for a company that has had myriad difficulties ramping up production at home --the Tesla factory still may not start operating for two to three years. Meanwhile, Tesla will continue to suffer from higher Chinese tariffs while its competitors play catch-up. China is already the world's largest EV market , with many domestic car makers able to produce low-end models.
Tesla has a long road ahead to reach its destination in China.

Tesla vehicle imports into China dropped from around 1,500 a month in the first half to around 260 a month on average in July and August, according to data collected by JL Warren Capital.
To drive around that pothole, Tesla plans to build its first factory in China--its second-largest market, accounting for around 17% of sales last year. The auto maker bought a 210-acre plot in Shanghai this week to build a factory it says could eventually produce up to 500,000 cars a year . In turn, Tesla could become the first foreign car maker to have a wholly owned factory in China.
First, it will need to find some cash . Tesla boss Elon Musk said in August that the Chinese factory will cost around $2 billion, though Goldman Sachs, for example, reckons total costs could amount to $4 billion to $5 billion. Tesla will need to raise that cash on top of refinancing $4.3 billion of its existing borrowings coming due by 2020.
Tesla expects what it calls ""local debt"" to fund much of the initial investment in its China plant, although who those local lenders might be is unclear. The Chinese government, which is eager to push its own electric-vehicle industry, may be interested in chipping in. It could, though, demand a steep price, such as forcing Tesla to transfer some of its technology.
Assuming everything works out--a big assumption for a company that has had myriad difficulties ramping up production at home --the Tesla factory still may not start operating for two to three years. Meanwhile, Tesla will continue to suffer from higher Chinese tariffs while its rivals play catch-up. China is already the world's largest EV market , with many domestic car makers able to produce low-end models.
Tesla has a long road ahead to reach its destination in China.

"Natural High: Gas Sellers Spared From China's Market Slump; Gainers in this downbeat year include China Gas Holdings, China Resources Gas, ENN Energy and Kunlun Energy","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2136396108?accountid=14586,"China's big gas distributors are among the few stock-market winners this year, despite higher fuel prices' cutting into profit margins.
What's Happening
Trade tensions and economic weakness have driven most mainland Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong lower this year. Less than a third of stocks in the Hang Seng's mainland-focused HSM 100 index are in positive territory for 2018.
Among the gainers, however, are gas distributors such as China Gas Holdings, with a market cap of $16 billion, and smaller rivals China Resources Gas Group, ENN Energy Holdings and Kunlun Energy Co.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has tried to curb pollution, partly by reining in coal use. That has increased gas consumption, which was up 19% from a year earlier in the first nine months of 2018.
The sudden expansion of the market has brought teething problems. A shortage late last year briefly tripled prices of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, causing some factories to close and pressuring the margins of local providers, which struggled to pass all of the increased cost to customers.
There could be some supply tightness again this winter, but Fitch Ratings sees the sector as better prepared overall. China increased both its import and storage capacity, and distributors have stocked up.
What it Means
Analysts at Nomura Securities say ""gas-supply tightness will become the new normal"" for China as demand growth keeps outstripping increases in domestic supply, requiring LNG imports to cover the gap. They foresee roughly 20% compound annual growth in earnings for China Gas and CR Gas over the next three years.
Their peers at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about China Gas, noting it has grown rapidly as coal-fired power stations switch to natural gas.
China's growing appetite is good for global LNG prices. The country's sharply increased imports over the past few years have made it the world's second-largest customer behind Japan.
At the same time, though, suppliers such as the U.S. and Australia have boosted production and export capabilities--which helps explain why prices remain well below the highs of earlier this decade.

"Trump: China to 'Reduce and Remove' Tariffs on American Cars; 'China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%,' president says","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2140769851?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI--China has agreed to cut tariffs on American-made cars, President Trump said on Twitter, apparently signaling Beijing's readiness to make concessions to prevent further escalating trade tensions.
Chinese officials didn't immediately confirm or deny Mr. Trump's assertion, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman on Monday sidestepping questions on auto tariffs.
""The two presidents instructed their economic teams to work toward the direction for removing all tariffs for win-win outcomes and mutual benefit,"" Geng Shuang said, describing the outcome of weekend talks between Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 Summit in Buenos Aires.
The concession would be a notable one on Beijing's part: U.S. automobile exports to China were worth $9.5 billion last year, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, topped only by aerospace and agriculture exports.
Three quarters of those exports came from four U.S. states: Alabama, California, Kentucky and South Carolina. Among the biggest beneficiaries if the tariffs are lifted, in addition to Ford Motor Co. and Tesla Inc. : German auto makers BMW AG and Daimler AG, which build sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. for export to China.
Still, the trade spat may ultimately persuade some manufacturers to insulate themselves against future tariff shocks by building fewer export models in the U.S.
""Long-term, in response to these disputes their strategy will be to export less and to build more locally,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based research consultancy Automotive Foresight.
BMW declined to comment. Daimler, Ford and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Trump announced the Chinese commitment to reduce tariffs in a tweet sent out late Sunday Washington, D.C. time, early Monday in Argentina. ""China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%,"" he said.
After Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi dined together Saturday night, the U.S. postponed by 90 days its threatened tariff increase --to 25% from 10% on $200 billion in Chinese goods--setting the stage for intense trade talks over the coming weeks. U.S. officials said that both countries recognized the increase would have hurt their economies.
Under international pressure to open its automotive sector, China cut its tariff on vehicles to 15% from 25% in July--but within days increased its tariff on U.S.-made cars to 40% in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs on vehicle imports.
That put companies exporting cars to China from the U.S.--notably BMW, Daimler's Mercedes unit, Ford and its Lincoln division, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV-owned Jeep, Tesla and Volvo Car Group--at a significant cost disadvantage to those shipping from Europe and Japan.
For Mr. Xi, the U.S. auto tariffs are a relatively painless issue on which to retreat without demanding reciprocal action from Washington: China exports very few vehicles to the U.S, and imports are a tiny fraction of China's domestic car market--4% of vehicles sold last year, or 1.2 million cars, according to the China Automobile Dealers Association. They were chiefly luxury cars destined for affluent buyers.
Most global auto makers build the bulk of the vehicles they sell in China at local plants through joint ventures. Some, such as General Motors Co., export to China only in very low volumes, though for others exports are a lucrative niche.
Ford was having a bleak year in China even before the tariffs hit, and through October its sales were down 31% from a year earlier, including a 15% drop in sales of imports. High-value imports had been a bright spot, but they too slowed as tariffs bit.
Sales of its Lincoln vehicles through October were up 3%--to nearly 46,000 vehicles, second only to BMW among U.S.-made imports--but Ford has been absorbing the cost of tariffs to keep retail prices competitive.
Similarly, Tesla last month--after its August-October sales in China slid 56% from a year earlier--said it would slash retail prices in China, canceling increases it had introduced to pass the cost of tariffs onto consumers.
Both Tesla and Ford are moving away from the export model.
Ford was already gearing up to start building Lincoln vehicles in China in 2019 before the trade dispute began; it plans to launch three localized models by 2021. Tesla said it would speed up plans to open a plant in Shanghai.
GM's announcement last month that it would close several U.S. plant drew fire from Mr. Trump , who declared the company should build more in the U.S. and less in China. But auto analysts said exporting cars from the U.S. to China no longer makes sense for most manufacturers.
Assembling autos in relatively costly U.S. plants and then shipping them across the Pacific is not ""economically viable in a hypercompetitive (and slowing) China market,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Shanghai consultancy Automobility.
Volvo, which had planned to base global production of its S60 sedan at its new plant in Charleston, SC, said last month it would instead split production between the U.S. and China in response to tariffs.
In interview earlier this year, Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo, which is owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., said tariffs were bad news for Volvo's American workers, whose jobs are partly supported by the export market.
BMW has made similar appeals against tariffs. A spokeswoman said that it exports 70% of the sports utility vehicles built at its plant in Spartanburg, S.C., and that over a third of those exports go to China. Earlier this year, BMW said it would build more models in China and acquired a majority stake in its local joint venture Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd.

"China's Plan for Tech Dominance Is Advancing, Business Groups Say; Critical report on 'Made in China 2025' issued as U.S.-China trade talks are set to resume next week","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2169257987?accountid=14586,"Two influential U.S. business groups have issued a report detailing how China is moving ahead with a technology policy set to be a key point of contention in the U.S.-China trade talks that resume next week in Washington.
In a joint report to the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in China say Beijing's ambitious plan to become a global technology leader is being widely implemented, casting doubt on efforts by Chinese officials to play down its significance.
There is evidence of ""a deep, concerted and continuing effort"" by provincial officials to pursue the central government's Made in China 2025 plan, which seeks to make China a leader in electric vehicles, aerospace, robotics and other frontiers of manufacturing, the two business groups say.
The report comes as negotiators for the U.S. and China prepare to continue trade talks in Washington Jan. 30.
The chambers wield clout with the White House as representatives of American companies doing business in China, many of whom are reluctant to criticize Beijing publicly.
The business associations also have influence among China's leaders as longtime advocates of closer U.S.-China business ties. To that audience, their report reinforces a message U.S. business leaders have been trying to convey to Beijing: China can no longer take U.S. business-group support for granted.
The USTR's investigation into Chinese trade practices last year concluded that Made in China 2025 created an unfair playing field for American companies, including by making their trade secrets vulnerable to Chinese competitors.
Under pressure from the U.S., Chinese officials have agreed to redraft the plan. Xin Guobin, vice minister of industry and information technology, conceded in a news briefing last week ""the need to improve the policy system.""
But Beijing negotiators also say the U.S. has exaggerated the significance of Made in China. Vice Premier Liu He, Beijing's top trade envoy to the U.S., has played down the importance of the plan in meetings with U.S. business groups, participants say.
The chambers' report was delivered last week to USTR and obtained by The Wall Street Journal. It advocates structural reforms to further open Chinese markets for foreign companies, including an end to forced transfer of trade secrets.
A spokesman for the USTR declined to comment on the report. The USTR's own March 2018 report, which alleges China has forced U.S. firms to hand over technology to Chinese partners, mentions the Made in China 2025 program 120 times. But it doesn't show how the program is being put into effect around the country, a topic the report by the two chambers of commerce examines in detail.
The business groups' 142-page report is silent on one of President Trump's main goals--reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China--but devotes 32 pages to how the Made in China plan is being rolled out nationwide.
In Guangdong province near Hong Kong, the report says local officials have solicited companies to become ""backbone"" robotics enterprises, create ""secure and reliable"" next-generation information-technology systems, and establish the region as a Made in China 2025 ""demonstration zone.""
The rust-belt province of Liaoning, meanwhile, has preferential tax policies for advanced manufacturing and for scientific investment, according to the report.
The report gives U.S. negotiators more evidence to press for changes during talks with the Chinese delegation, which are to be led by Mr. Liu. The U.S. has suspended until March 1 plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from the current 10%, while the two sides carry on talks.
The chambers' report focuses on the specifics needed to change China's economy so U.S. companies compete more fairly, giving ammunition, however to those who worry Mr. Trump will settle for promises by China to buy more U.S. goods and services and largely ignore structural changes. In midlevel negotiations in Beijing earlier this month, about half the time was taken up on prospective purchases, negotiators say.
The chambers don't push--or even mention--additional U.S. exports. ""Purchases may be important to this administration, but in terms of [fundamental reform] going forward, purchases are not the answer,"" said Jeremie Waterman, head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's China Center.
Among other recommendations, the report advocates the creation of a new international arbitration system to resolve complaints by U.S. companies that believe they were mistreated in China. That could be a tough sell to both governments, as the Trump administration has tried to reduce the power of international bodies and China could object to a system that overrules its judiciary.

Did he and the Democrats in Congress make any progress?"" The answer is yes, though the project remained slightly incomplete at the time of President Trump's election. A coalition was formed in this regard, and a consensus was arrived at, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a comprehensive, multilateral trade agreement among all the major trading nations along the Pacific Rim with the exclusion of China; this rankled the Chinese leadership and they attempted to counter with a rare multilateral trade agreement of their own.
While it is difficult to defend most of the legislation, executive orders and pseudo-treaties (Iran nuclear, Paris climate) that were promulgated under President Obama, the passage of TPP would have hamstrung, to some degree, many of China's larger ambitions that are now in the works: Belt and Road Initiative, Made in China 2025, possibly some of the expansion in the South China Sea, their own trade negotiations with the nations that were part of TPP, etc.
President Trump honored his campaign promise to deep-six America's participation in the TPP but he received nothing from China for doing so unilaterally. It was the biggest chit for the art of dealing for the protection of intellectual property, the control of fentanyl exports, the tamping down of cyber espionage and other diplomatic, political and economic concerns much larger than the fluctuating price of soybeans. When we received nothing for it, the champagne corks popped in the Chinese Politboro and America's trade negotiators were left in a weaker position.

"U.S. Government Bonds Climb on Approach of China Trade Deadline; Increased tariffs on imports from China are set to kick in Friday, and China has vowed to retaliate","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2221902670?accountid=14586,"U.S. government-bond prices rose Thursday as investor concerns intensified about the risk that the U.S. and China might not reach a trade deal.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell for the fourth time in the past five trading sessions, settling at 2.453% from 2.484% Wednesday.
Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, declined with stocks and other riskier assets and as investors reallocated to the safety of U.S. government debt. Treasurys' reliable interest payments tend to become more attractive when the prospects for the economy are less certain.
The U.S. and China are the world's largest economies, setting the pace of consumption and manufacturing around the world, driving demand for commodities such as oil and copper, as well as finished goods such as autos and consumer electronics. Growth in Europe, whose economies are fueled by exports and trade, has been hard hit by slowing consumer demand from China.
""The market's concerned that maybe things will get worse before they get better,"" said Donald Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at Federated Investors. ""We're seeing this reflected in risk assets, and that's created a flight-to-quality.""

Mr. Ellenberger said he has added to his holdings of U.S. government debt as tensions have increased.
Increased tariffs on imports from China are set to kick in early Friday, and China has vowed to retaliate. Higher tariffs are likely to slow trade between the two largest economies and contribute to a further slowdown in global economic growth, analysts said.
Adding to the pressure, the U.S. formally filed paperwork Wednesday to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from the current 10% at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Beijing's Commerce Ministry responded by threatening to take unspecified countermeasures. At a campaign rally in Florida Wednesday night, President Trump said Chinese leaders ""broke the deal"" in trade talks with the U.S.
The 10-year yield hovered near the rate on three-month Treasury bills, briefly falling below the shorter-term rate Thursday. Investors and Fed officials closely watch the dispersion of short- and longer-term yieldsâknown as the yield curveâbecause the three-month yield has exceeded the 10-year yield ahead of every recession since 1975.
Three-month and 10-year yields inverted for about one week in March, with shorter-term yields exceeding those for longer-term debt for the first time since August 2007.

"Tiananmen: The Crackdown That Defined Modern China; In the spring of 1989, a democratic future for China seemed possible. Then came Tiananmen. The U.S.-China relationship still hasn't recovered.","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2232415603?accountid=14586,"To stroll through Tiananmen Square that soft spring day in mid-May 1989 was to experience an atmosphere of excitement, hope and optimism unparalleled in recent Chinese history. Hundreds of thousands of idealistic demonstrators had flooded their country's most hallowed public space. What had catalyzed the immense, exuberant crowd was a spontaneous impulse to memorialize the April 15 death of Hu Yaobang, the former Communist Party General Secretary, who had been cashiered two years earlier for failing to suppress student demonstrations. Now this unexpected remembrance had morphed into the longest and largest mass protest in Chinese history .
To get a better view, I climbed up into an empty traffic kiosk in front of Mao's iconic portrait on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Stretching away to the east and west as far as the eye could see were two enormous rivers of bobbing heads and floating banners, surging joyously down the broad Avenue of Eternal Peace into Tiananmen Square. Besides students, there were families with children in strollers, Buddhist monks in robes, government bureaucrats in suits, laborers on heavy earth-moving equipment, elderly pensioners and even a gang of street hooligans with a placard reading, ""Don't Fight, Don't Make Trouble.""
The media, long under the strict control of the Central Propaganda Department, had also come to life for the first time in decades. Even the once-turgid People's Daily was not only accurately reporting each startling day's events but publishing ecstatic poetry, such as one verse that began: ""Standing at the edge of winter/ Looking forward to spring,/ I feel spring so close to me.""
China was indeed experiencing a springtime. At last, its halting tradition of democratic activism and cosmopolitan aspiration seemed on the verge of triumphing over the rival traditions of imperial rule and Leninism. Here was definitive proof that ideas of freedom were not just a foreign import or imposition. For the first time since 1949, one could suddenly imagine a China that was both more democratic and more fully integrated into the outside world.
But the moment didn't last, as we know in marking this week's melancholy 30th anniversary. Whatever the power of China's long-suppressed democratic hopes, they could not withstand the ideological determination and brutal might of the Chinese Communist Party. The crushing of the Tiananmen protest movement was a shock not just to all those intoxicated, idealistic Chinese demonstrators but also to Westerners like myself who believed that, with our help, China was starting to find its way to being a more modern and open society.
The tragedy of that possibly misplaced faith weighs especially heavily today. Under President Xi Jinping, a newly assertive authoritarian China now strikes many in the U.S. not just as a disappointment but as a threat. In retrospect, through the ups and downs of decades of diplomatic engagement and growing economic connection, the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989 now appears to be the moment when the regime most fully revealed the fundamental principles that now guide Mr. Xi and a rising China.
The Tiananmen demonstrations were hardly the first chapter in China's striving for greater political openness. A reform movement at the end of the last imperial dynasty had segued into Sun Yat-sen's short-lived constitutional republic in 1912. There had been the May 4th Movement of 1919, when mass protests erupted across the country in opposition to great-power imperialism and in support of ""science and democracy."" And in the 1930s, Chiang Kai-shek had presided over a seemingly promising ""Golden Era"" of stability and reform, brought to an end by Japanese occupation and World War II.
With the victory of Mao's communist revolution in 1949, China's democratic tradition was stifled. It didn't revive again until the late 1970s and '80s, when Deng Xiaoping's bold new agenda of ""reform and opening up"" brought not only radical market reforms in the state-controlled economy but a relaxation of political controls as well.
As protesters poured into Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989, the long-suppressed democratic hopes of the Chinese people were welling up again like a great lava vent. The square, the party's sanctum sanctorum, had been turned into a liberated zone, creating a heady, if naive, sense of invincibility among protesters. I watched as one father sat beside his hunger-striking daughter, daubing her brow with a cool cloth. ""My generation never dared speak out, much less to act out what we believed,"" he sobbed. ""Now my daughter's doing it for me."" A Peking University student told me, ""There's no way the party will ever get things back into the old bottle! Just look around us. History's sweeping them away!""
When a grim-faced Premier Li Peng appeared on television on May 19 to declare martial law, it was clear that a moment of reckoning was approaching. ""An extremely small handful of people who want to achieve their political goalâ¦are undermining the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,"" he intoned. The government had decided to ""take decisive and firm measures to put a swift end to the turmoil.""
To everyone's surprise, however, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered the city, hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded the streets to peacefully block their march to the square. As this putative ""people's army"" was stopped by the people themselves, protesters rejoiced by playing Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy.""
But even as they celebrated, a humiliated Deng was planning a second, more unyielding assault. On June 3, the loudspeakers around Tiananmen Square crackled to life, and an ominous voice thundered: ""For many days now, the Liberation Army has exercised restraint, but now it must resolutely counteract the rebellion.""
This time, with fresh columns of PLA troops brandishing automatic weapons and led by armored vehicles, not even the thousands of angry citizens who again rallied in the streets to throw up barricades could stop them. When dawn broke over the smoking wreckage on the morning of June 4, untold numbers had been killed and wounded. The seven-week-long protest movement had been crushed and, with it, the dream of a more democratic China.
The crackdown left the U.S. in a quandary unlike any it had faced since the Nixon-Kissinger breakthrough of 1972. At the heart of its still imperfectly formed relationship with the Communist regime was the expectation that China would continue to undergo economic and political reform, gradually becoming more congruent with the existing international order and better integrated into it. But political liberalization had now been dealt a decisive blow. Could the policy of engagement proceed on narrower grounds? Might China still find a place in the global economic order and perhaps even be goaded back toward a political system that allowed for more freedom of speech, individual rights and dissent? After all, as the U.S. policy establishment averred, were open markets not a sure path to more open societies?
In the decades after the Tiananmen crackdown, such rationales defined American policy. In the immediate wake of the June 1989 massacre, President George H.W. Bush, a Republican realist more concerned with the balance of power than human rights, bent over backward to keep channels open with Deng by sending his trusted national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, on a secret visit to Beijing. The decision to keep interacting with China, even as the memory of the massacre was still raw, was controversial, but Deng's rededication to economic reform soon afterward seemed to vindicate it.
Indeed, the commitment to continuing economic engagement became a bipartisan U.S. view. After deriding ""tyrants from Baghdad to Beijing,"" President Bill Clinton, the Democrat who defeated Bush in 1992, not only flip-flopped and approved permanent most-favored-nation trading status for Beijing but facilitated China's eventual entrance, in 2001, into the World Trade Organization. As President Clinton declared, admission to the WTO was the best way ""to integrate China further into the family of nations and secure our interests and ideals."" A more open trading relationship, he predicted, would advance reform in China and have ""a profound impact on human rights and liberty.""
Others were less starry-eyed about the move and simply saw China's acceptance into the WTO as good for business. In any event, the Chinese economic miracle in the years thereafter grew in no small measure from the American willingness to continue engaging with China, both diplomatically and economically.
President George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 declaring that trade was not only economically advantageous but capable of creating ""habits of liberty"" and ""expectations of democracy."" He too was a proponent of engagement, directing his Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, to set up a Strategic Economic Dialogue, a ""forum for discussing ways the United States and China can work together to address economic challenges and opportunities as responsible stakeholders in the international economic system.""
President Barack Obama also made a concerted effort to continue working with China, even after being received with notable coolness at a Beijing summit in 2009. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, sought to reassure the country's Communist leaders that while human-rights issues were important, it was also ""essential that the U.S. and China have a positive, cooperative relationship."" She cautioned against allowing such concerns to interfere with efforts to tackle ""the global economic crisis, the global climate-change crisis and the security crisis."" Indeed, every president since Nixon has tried to reassure Beijing that the U.S. has no intention of either ""containing"" China or preventing it from gaining its ""rightful place in the world.""
As for China's leaders themselves, they have never hinted at second thoughts about the fateful decisions of June 1989. Indeed, when the Soviet Union disintegrated two years later, the regime felt vindicated: The mistakes of Mikhail Gorbachev made it clear that communist states that opened up politically were simply signing their own death warrant.
Nor were they persuaded that U.S. intentions were benign in focusing so single-mindedly on China's economic integration into the world order. They sometimes reciprocated American rhetoric by adopting sympathetic policies, with soothing slogans such as ""peaceful rise,"" suggesting that a wealthier, more powerful China need not be aggressive or disruptive. Such signals allowed Western proponents of engagement to stick to the idea that both China and the U.S. would only benefit from deeper ties. At the same time, however, the party kept alive official rhetoric about the U.S. being a ""hostile foreign force"" and continued reviling the notion of China's ""peaceful evolution"" as a Western plot to undermine communism.
In hindsight, the crushing of the 1989 democracy movement was a clear indication that China's leadership understood and rejected the cost of moving onto ""the right side of history"" (to borrow President Clinton's Panglossian term) and joining the U.S.-dominated global order. For Americans, it was a beguiling dream and expressed a genuine desire to work things out between the two countries without provoking conflict. But it was a hope that too often overlooked just how antithetical the two countries' systems, values and perceptions of their national interests actually remained.
The limits of such wishful thinking have become more obvious since 2012, when Xi Jinping began his ascent to the top of the Chinese leadership. With his new Big Leader cult, disdain for democracy, authoritarian zeal and repudiation of political reform, Mr. Xi has prompted a far-reaching reconsideration among U.S. foreign policy elites, including second thoughts about the wisdom of the policy of engagement itself. Indeed, his policiesâexpanded party control over the economy, heightened state censorship, persecution of minorities (especially the Uighurs and the Tibetans) and a more assertive military posture in ""core interest"" areas of the South and East China Seas and the Taiwan Straitsâleave no doubt that the U.S. and China have widely divergent interests and aims for the global order.
For the roots of today's impasse and increasing hostility, we must look back to the crackdown of 1989 and its aftermath. Both the uprising in Tiananmen Square and the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union led Deng and other hard-line Chinese leaders to conclude that democratization and even some forms of economic reform were direct threats to one-party rule. As both sorts of reform have lagged in China, it has become harder for any American to make the case that China and the U.S. are still coming together, even slowly. And without some kind of convergence, ""engagement"" as a policy becomes futile.
Today's trade problemsâwith President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Mr. Xi's increasingly resistant Chinaâare just one small expression of a far wider and less tractable clash of systems and values. This antagonism is the logical and inevitable result of China's assertively autocratic policies over the past 30 years. If things continue to unravel, which seems likely, both Chinese and Americans may well look back on Deng's bold, pragmatic reforms of the 1980s with a wistful sense of opportunity lost and on the suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations as a pathway foreclosed.

30 YEARS AFTER TIANANMEN
Tiananmen's Survivors and the Burden of Memory
Protesters who lived through the crackdown now wonder what they could have done differently and how to share their stories with today's Chinese
1989 and the Birth of State Capitalism in China
In the 1980s, Beijing allowed decentralized markets to flourish and private firms to prosper. After Tiananmen, the party took more economic control to ensure its own power and survival.
China's Effort to Erase the June 4th Protests From History"
"REVIEW --- 30 Years After Tiananmen: The Crackdown That Defined Modern China --- In the spring of 1989, a democratic future for China seemed possible. Then came Tiananmen. The U.S.- China relationship still hasn't recovered.","Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2233027376?accountid=14586,"To stroll through Tiananmen Square that soft spring day in mid-May 1989 was to experience an atmosphere of excitement, hope and optimism unparalleled in recent Chinese history. Hundreds of thousands of idealistic demonstrators had flooded their country's most hallowed public space. What had catalyzed the immense, exuberant crowd was a spontaneous impulse to memorialize the April 15 death of Hu Yaobang, the former Communist Party General Secretary, who had been cashiered two years earlier for failing to suppress student demonstrations. Now this unexpected remembrance had morphed into the longest and largest mass protest in Chinese history.
To get a better view, I climbed up into an empty traffic kiosk in front of Mao's iconic portrait on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Stretching away to the east and west as far as the eye could see were two enormous rivers of bobbing heads and floating banners, surging joyously down the broad Avenue of Eternal Peace into Tiananmen Square. Besides students, there were families with children in strollers, Buddhist monks in robes, government bureaucrats in suits, laborers on heavy earth-moving equipment, elderly pensioners and even a gang of street hooligans with a placard reading, ""Don't Fight, Don't Make Trouble.""
The media, long under the strict control of the Central Propaganda Department, had also come to life for the first time in decades. Even the once-turgid People's Daily was not only accurately reporting each startling day's events but publishing ecstatic poetry, such as one verse that began: ""Standing at the edge of winter / Looking forward to spring, / I feel spring so close to me.""
China was indeed experiencing a springtime. At last, its halting tradition of democratic activism and cosmopolitan aspiration seemed on the verge of triumphing over the rival traditions of imperial rule and Leninism. Here was definitive proof that ideas of freedom were not just a foreign import or imposition. For the first time since 1949, one could suddenly imagine a China that was both more democratic and more fully integrated into the outside world.
But the moment didn't last, as we know in marking this week's melancholy 30th anniversary. Whatever the power of China's long-suppressed democratic hopes, they could not withstand the ideological determination and brutal might of the Chinese Communist Party. The crushing of the Tiananmen protest movement was a shock not just to all those intoxicated, idealistic Chinese demonstrators but also to Westerners like myself who believed that, with our help, China was starting to find its way to being a more modern and open society.
The tragedy of that possibly misplaced faith weighs especially heavily today. Under President Xi Jinping, a newly assertive authoritarian China now strikes many in the U.S. not just as a disappointment but as a threat. In retrospect, through the ups and downs of decades of diplomatic engagement and growing economic connection, the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989 now appears to be the moment when the regime most fully revealed the fundamental principles that now guide Mr. Xi and a rising China.
The Tiananmen demonstrations were hardly the first chapter in China's striving for greater political openness. A reform movement at the end of the last imperial dynasty had segued into Sun Yat-sen's short-lived constitutional republic in 1912. There had been the May 4th Movement of 1919, when mass protests erupted across the country in opposition to great-power imperialism and in support of ""science and democracy."" And in the 1930s, Chiang Kai-shek had presided over a seemingly promising ""Golden Era"" of stability and reform, brought to an end by Japanese occupation and World War II.
With the victory of Mao's communist revolution in 1949, China's democratic tradition was stifled. It didn't revive again until the late 1970s and '80s, when Deng Xiaoping's bold new agenda of ""reform and opening up"" brought not only radical market reforms in the state-controlled economy but a relaxation of political controls as well.
As protesters poured into Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989, the long-suppressed democratic hopes of the Chinese people were welling up again like a great lava vent. The square, the party's sanctum sanctorum, had been turned into a liberated zone, creating a heady, if naive, sense of invincibility among protesters. I watched as one father sat beside his hunger-striking daughter, daubing her brow with a cool cloth. ""My generation never dared speak out, much less to act out what we believed,"" he sobbed. ""Now my daughter's doing it for me."" A Peking University student told me, ""There's no way the party will ever get things back into the old bottle! Just look around us. History's sweeping them away!""
When a grim-faced Premier Li Peng appeared on television on May 19 to declare martial law, it was clear that a moment of reckoning was approaching. ""An extremely small handful of people who want to achieve their political goal . . . are undermining the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,"" he intoned. The government had decided to ""take decisive and firm measures to put a swift end to the turmoil.""
To everyone's surprise, however, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered the city, hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded the streets to peacefully block their march to the square. As this putative ""people's army"" was stopped by the people themselves, protesters rejoiced by playing Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy.""
But even as they celebrated, a humiliated Deng was planning a second, more unyielding assault. On June 3, the loudspeakers around Tiananmen Square crackled to life, and an ominous voice thundered: ""For many days now, the Liberation Army has exercised restraint, but now it must resolutely counteract the rebellion.""
This time, with fresh columns of PLA troops brandishing automatic weapons and led by armored vehicles, not even the thousands of angry citizens who again rallied in the streets to throw up barricades could stop them. When dawn broke over the smoking wreckage on the morning of June 4, untold numbers had been killed and wounded. The seven-week-long protest movement had been crushed and, with it, the dream of a more democratic China.
The crackdown left the U.S. in a quandary unlike any it had faced since the Nixon-Kissinger breakthrough of 1972. At the heart of its still imperfectly formed relationship with the Communist regime was the expectation that China would continue to undergo economic and political reform, gradually becoming more congruent with the existing international order and better integrated into it. But political liberalization had now been dealt a decisive blow. Could the policy of engagement proceed on narrower grounds? Might China still find a place in the global economic order and perhaps even be goaded back toward a political system that allowed for more freedom of speech, individual rights and dissent? After all, as the U.S. policy establishment averred, were open markets not a sure path to more open societies?
In the decades after the Tiananmen crackdown, such rationales defined American policy. In the immediate wake of the June 1989 massacre, President George H.W. Bush, a Republican realist more concerned with the balance of power than human rights, bent over backward to keep channels open with Deng by sending his trusted national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, on a secret visit to Beijing. The decision to keep interacting with China, even as the memory of the massacre was still raw, was controversial, but Deng's rededication to economic reform soon afterward seemed to vindicate it.
Indeed, the commitment to continuing economic engagement became a bipartisan U.S. view. After deriding ""tyrants from Baghdad to Beijing,"" President Bill Clinton, the Democrat who defeated Bush in 1992, not only flip-flopped and approved permanent most-favored-nation trading status for Beijing but facilitated China's eventual entrance, in 2001, into the World Trade Organization. As President Clinton declared, admission to the WTO was the best way ""to integrate China further into the family of nations and secure our interests and ideals."" A more open trading relationship, he predicted, would advance reform in China and have ""a profound impact on human rights and liberty.""
Others were less starry-eyed about the move and simply saw China's acceptance into the WTO as good for business. In any event, the Chinese economic miracle in the years thereafter grew in no small measure from the American willingness to continue engaging with China, both diplomatically and economically.
President George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 declaring that trade was not only economically advantageous but capable of creating ""habits of liberty"" and ""expectations of democracy."" He too was a proponent of engagement, directing his Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, to set up a Strategic Economic Dialogue, a ""forum for discussing ways the United States and China can work together to address economic challenges and opportunities as responsible stakeholders in the international economic system.""
President Barack Obama also made a concerted effort to continue working with China, even after being received with notable coolness at a Beijing summit in 2009. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, sought to reassure the country's Communist leaders that while human-rights issues were important, it was also ""essential that the U.S. and China have a positive, cooperative relationship."" She cautioned against allowing such concerns to interfere with efforts to tackle ""the global economic crisis, the global climate-change crisis and the security crisis."" Indeed, every president since Nixon has tried to reassure Beijing that the U.S. has no intention of either ""containing"" China or preventing it from gaining its ""rightful place in the world.""
As for China's leaders themselves, they have never hinted at second thoughts about the fateful decisions of June 1989. Indeed, when the Soviet Union disintegrated two years later, the regime felt vindicated: The mistakes of Mikhail Gorbachev made it clear that communist states that opened up politically were simply signing their own death warrant.
Nor were they persuaded that U.S. intentions were benign in focusing so single-mindedly on China's economic integration into the world order. They sometimes reciprocated American rhetoric by adopting sympathetic policies, with soothing slogans such as ""peaceful rise,"" suggesting that a wealthier, more powerful China need not be aggressive or disruptive. Such signals allowed Western proponents of engagement to stick to the idea that both China and the U.S. would only benefit from deeper ties. At the same time, however, the party kept alive official rhetoric about the U.S. being a ""hostile foreign force"" and continued reviling the notion of China's ""peaceful evolution"" as a Western plot to undermine communism.
In hindsight, the crushing of the 1989 democracy movement was a clear indication that China's leadership understood and rejected the cost of moving onto ""the right side of history"" (to borrow President Clinton's Panglossian term) and joining the U.S.-dominated global order. For Americans, it was a beguiling dream and expressed a genuine desire to work things out between the two countries without provoking conflict. But it was a hope that too often overlooked just how antithetical the two countries' systems, values and perceptions of their national interests actually remained.
The limits of such wishful thinking have become more obvious since 2012, when Xi Jinping began his ascent to the top of the Chinese leadership. With his new Big Leader cult, disdain for democracy, authoritarian zeal and repudiation of political reform, Mr. Xi has prompted a far-reaching reconsideration among U.S. foreign policy elites, including second thoughts about the wisdom of the policy of engagement itself. Indeed, his policies -- expanded party control over the economy, heightened state censorship, persecution of minorities (especially the Uighurs and the Tibetans) and a more assertive military posture in ""core interest"" areas of the South and East China Seas and the Taiwan Straits -- leave no doubt that the U.S. and China have widely divergent interests and aims for the global order.
For the roots of today's impasse and increasing hostility, we must look back to the crackdown of 1989 and its aftermath. Both the uprising in Tiananmen Square and the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union led Deng and other hard-line Chinese leaders to conclude that democratization and even some forms of economic reform were direct threats to one-party rule. As both sorts of reform have lagged in China, it has become harder for any American to make the case that China and the U.S. are still coming together, even slowly. And without some kind of convergence, ""engagement"" as a policy becomes futile.
Today's trade problems -- with President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Mr. Xi's increasingly resistant China -- are just one small expression of a far wider and less tractable clash of systems and values. This antagonism is the logical and inevitable result of China's assertively autocratic policies over the past 30 years. If things continue to unravel, which seems likely, both Chinese and Americans may well look back on Deng's bold, pragmatic reforms of the 1980s with a wistful sense of opportunity lost and on the suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations as a pathway foreclosed.

Rex Tillerson's South China Sea Remarks Foreshadow Possible Foreign Policy Crisis,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1858171866?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG -- Rex W. Tillerson's call for China to be denied access to its artificial islands in the South China Sea, made Wednesday during his confirmation hearing for secretary of state, set the stage for a possible crisis between the world's two biggest economies should his comments become official American policy.
Mr. Tillerson told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that China's multibillion-dollar island-building campaign in the oil-and-gas rich sea was illegal and ""akin to Russia's taking of Crimea.""
""We're going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops,"" Mr. Tillerson told the senators. ""And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.""
Should those words be translated into action after Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency on Jan. 20, it would be a remarkable change in the American approach to Beijing's island-building in the South China Sea, which is transforming the area into what one Washington think tank said would by 2030 become ""virtually a Chinese lake."" China asserts sovereignty over most of the South China Sea despite competing claims by countries including Vietnam and the Philippines and an international ruling rejecting most of Beijing's assertions.
The Obama administration has challenged what it calls China's ""excessive maritime claims"" in the sea by sailing warships close to the artificial islands, some of which feature deep harbors and runways capable of handling jumbo jets. But that has not stopped China from continuing its buildup, which now includes military installations such as radar stations on more than 3,000 acres of artificial land built on reefs and shoals.
Mr. Tillerson's comments, with the possible implication that the United States might use its armed forces to deny the Chinese access to the islands, garnered reactions including confusion, disbelief and warlike threats from analysts in China.
""This is a signal, now that Trump is set to take office, that he wants to have a tough stand on China,"" said Yang Chengjun, a retired senior colonel and military expert, who said that China's potential war-fighting capability was greater than America's. ""China does not stir up troubles but we are not afraid of them when they come.""
Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, declined to answer a reporter's question about what Beijing might do if the United States Navy moved to deny China access to the islands, saying it was a ""hypothetical question.""
But his reaction also highlighted the confusion sown by the testimony, because Mr. Tillerson did not explain how the United States could block China from the islands.
""I can't predict what Mr. Tillerson is thinking specifically, and on the other hand, it is impossible for me to make any prediction about China's policy, based on your assumptions of what he said,"" Mr. Lu said.
That confusion was shared by one of China's most prominent experts on the South China Sea, who also questioned the legality of any American effort to block access to the islands.
""Is this a warning? Or will this be a policy option?"" said Zhu Feng, executive director of the China Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea at Nanjing University. ""If this is a policy option, this will not be able to block China's access to these constructed islands. There is no legal basis.""
Mr. Trump's transition team did not respond to emailed questions asking for details on Mr. Tillerson's remarks, and whether they represented the intended policy of the United States after Mr. Trump assumes the presidency.
What is also not clear is the extent to which Mr. Tillerson's tough stance on the South China Sea springs from his extensive experience in the region during his time as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, when his company became embroiled in bitter territorial disputes over the extensive oil and gas reserves beneath the seafloor.
During his tenure, the company forged close ties to the Vietnamese government, signing an agreement in 2009 with a state-owned firm to drill for oil and gas in two areas in the South China Sea. The agreement with PetroVietnam was signed quietly, according to a leaked United States diplomatic cable, because it conflicted with Chinese territorial claims.
While Exxon Mobil has some operations in China, including a stake in a petrochemical plant in the country's south, it has a very small presence in the country's huge retail market for gasoline, which is dominated by state-owned Chinese companies. In contrast, its agreements with Vietnam are potentially huge, given that the South China Sea may contain 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.
A spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil in Singapore did not return a phone call asking for comment about the company's operations in Vietnam. The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry did not reply to a request for comment about Mr. Tillerson's remarks.
But his statements have put further strains on one of the world's most important bilateral relationships. Policy directions set by President Richard M. Nixon more than 40 years ago have remained relatively steady under the Republican and Democratic administrations that followed. But Mr. Trump's talk of enacting new tariffs on Chinese goods and his willingness to break decades of protocol by taking a phone call from Taiwan's president have called those policies into question.
""How much farther will the Trump administration go?"" said Mr. Zhu of Nanjing University. ""When it comes to South China Sea, we'll have to wait and see.""

Trump Injects High Risk Into Relations With China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1861695144?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING -- For China, President Trump's scrapping of the American-brokered Pacific trade agreement is a chance to extend Beijing's economic and political influence. And it is an opportunity to deepen ties with its neighbors in Asia.
But with a cooling economy at home and a looming leadership shake-up, the last thing President Xi Jinping wants is a trade war, though officials are girding for that possibility. Rather, China's leaders crave stability and predictability.
Early signs indicate they may not get their wish. The Chinese fear that if Mr. Trump was willing to toss aside years of delicate negotiations with allies and decades of American trade policy, he could also go his own way on issues he has staked out with Beijing, including Taiwan and the South China Sea.
As if to bolster that point, on Monday -- the same day that Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement -- his spokesman said the United States would prevent China from accessing islands it claims in the South China Sea, a threat that one nationalist Chinese newspaper had already warned would mean war.
""This shows that Trump might act on his words,"" Deng Yuwen, a public affairs commentator in Beijing, said in an interview. ""With previous presidents, their election promises weren't taken so seriously.""
He added, ""That means China must take his other warnings more seriously, especially about the South China Sea and Taiwan.""
Mr. Trump's goal in squelching the trade agreement was to protect American jobs and businesses. His trade officials have argued that the deal does not do enough to help the United States or to contain China, which was not invited to join the agreement.
But in killing an agreement designed to limit China's vast economic reach in Asia and anchor America's presence in the world's fastest growing region, analysts said, Mr. Trump created a void that President Xi was already practicing to fill.
Only last week, Mr. Xi was trying on the mantle of global leadership at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, suggesting that with the United States in retreat, China was prepared to step up as a champion of free trade and protector of the global environment.
Mr. Xi has kept China's economy behind high walls, and China remains the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but inconsistencies have never ruffled the president.
""This is indeed a big win for China in the struggle for global leadership,"" said Zhang Baohui, director of the center for Asia Pacific studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. ""Trump is surrendering this opportunity to prove the continuing relevance of American primacy.""
The death of the trade agreement is likely to accelerate Beijing's push for its alternative trade agreement, the China-centered Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
That agreement would exclude the United States and would reduce or eliminate tariffs on trade among China, Southeast Asian nations, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. It includes few of the features of T.P.P. that would have been most awkward for Beijing, such as protections for independent labor unions and the environment, and requirements that state-owned enterprises behave more like commercial enterprises.
The agreement has stalled on rifts between Southeast Asian nations and the others, but Thailand's minister of commerce, Apiradi Tantraporn, said Monday that the talks ""are expected to be expedited"" without the T.P.P.
But the end of the T.P.P. will not be Mr. Trump's last word on trade with China.
His trade officials say they expect greater access to the Chinese market in exchange for the easy access Chinese goods have to the United States. And they appear prepared to risk a trade war, an expanding tit-for-tat contest of tariffs and other trade restrictions, to get it.
Mr. Trump's trade officials have threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods, starting with heavily subsidized products such as steel and aluminum, imported into the United States. ""It's a little weird that we have very low tariffs and China has very high tariffs,"" Wilbur Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary, said at his Senate confirmation hearing last week.
Last week, China proposed allowing greater foreign investment in certain sectors, but there was little confidence the recommendations would be carried out in the foreseeable future, and American businesses said they felt less welcome in China than before.
While Mr. Trump's advisers say that China has more to lose than the United States in a trade war, Chinese officials told visiting American businessmen last week that Beijing was prepared. They had developed lists of punitive options they would take against the United States if Washington took the initiative, they said.
""The signals are very clear: If this is going to be a trade war, China will reduce imports of American aircraft from Boeing and agricultural products,"" said Wu Xinbo, director of American studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ""We can turn to Europe, Australia and Canada for those products. And we know that 20 to 30 of the states in the United States with big agricultural lobbies and Boeing plants will be putting pressure on Congress.""
A long-serving American trade expert in China agreed, saying China was prepared to go to the mat.
""Trump's trade team would be wise to shelve 'The Art of the Deal' and focus on the 'Art of War,' if they really want to know what's ahead in U.S.-China trade relations,"" said James Zimmerman, a managing partner of the Beijing office of the law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton who has worked in China for 19 years. ""China views Trump as a paper tiger that will likely back down on the complicated, thorny issues that are not negotiable. The Chinese also know that Trump won't risk a trade war lest the business community will be up in arms.""
Others, though, detect anxiety, and read China's outward confidence as bluster. Bilahari Kausikan, ambassador at large for Singapore, said China had ""a real insecurity about a trade war.""
Both sides are likely to lose, he said, but China stands to lose more ""since the U.S. domestic political order is not at stake in the same way as the Chinese Communist Party rule may be at stake.""
The next few months, as Mr. Xi focuses on choosing new members of the ruling Standing Committee for his second five-year term, will be a particularly tense political period, and economic instability is the last thing he needs. Similarly, he will try at all costs to appear strong to his domestic, nationalistic audience in the face of challenges from Mr. Trump on Taiwan and the South China Sea.
Mr. Trump has suggested that the One China policy, under which the United States recognizes the government of Beijing and not Taiwan, is not sacrosanct, a major concern for Mr. Xi.
""In a year of political transition, Xi cannot afford to come across as weak,"" said Paul Haenle, the director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, who served as China director for the National Security Council under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. ""Taiwan is the core of core issues for China -- a bottom line. Many Chinese stress that it is nonnegotiable.""
But for now, at least, the increased contention with Washington is likely to strengthen Mr. Xi's political hand at home by rallying public and elite support against a foreign threat, said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics and Chinese-American relations.
""Short term, it will almost certainly give the Chinese government a boost in its public support,"" Dr. Pei said in a telephone interview. ""It helps Xi, because whenever there is such pressure from outside, Chinese officials tend to rally around the top leader.""
Mr. Trump has also threatened China on control of territory it claims in the South China Sea. The comments by Mr. Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Monday echoed those made by his nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, at his Senate confirmation hearing.
While Mr. Trump has not explained how he will keep China off islands where it has built airstrips and installed weapons, the comments by his appointees suggest the possibility of an American blockade. While Mr. Obama tried unsuccessfully to leverage American allies in the region to compel China to back down, Mr. Trump seems willing to abandon them and face China on his own.
That go-it-alone attitude has raised alarms at the Pentagon and among American Navy experts, who said such a blockade would be tantamount to war. The idea has also alarmed America's allies.
Australia, Washington's staunchest ally in the Asia Pacific region, would not participate in such a venture, its defense officials said, adding that a blockade could not be successful and could serve to persuade disenchanted American friends in the Asia Pacific to pivot toward China.
With Mr. Trump portending divisive action on many fronts, Mr. Xi was calm and prepared, his foreign minister, Wang Yi, suggested.
""Serene under the tumultuous clouds,"" Mr. Wang said, quoting a line from a poem by Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist China.
No one knows how long that will be the case.

Isolating China Doesn't Work,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865287196?accountid=14586,"Â  The United States and China have been inextricably linked since the birth of America. The first fortunes made in the United States came thanks to the tea trade with China. The profits made in Canton and reinvested in America transformed the young republic into the 19th century's factory of the world. For its part, 19th-century China turned to the United States as the first country to educate its young in a desperate effort to counter the West. In the present day, the United States, with its open wallets, open universities and open society, has been by far the most important foreign enabler of China's rise.
Throughout the course of this shared history, Americans have generally held that a strong China was in their interests. But now that China is strong, many Americans are not so sure. For the last decade and a half, neither side has figured out how much of the other it wants and how much of the other it hates.
No matter who became United States president in 2017, a reckoning was due. China's rise has been too rapid. Along the way, Beijing has gamed the international system created by the United States to increase its growth at the expense of others, engaged in widespread industrial espionage as a shortcut to innovation, repressed free speech at home and bolstered governments abroad such as North Korea that threaten their neighbors and the United States.
Regardless of political party, the majority of those in Washington who make China policy have united around the view that Beijing has, in the words of one adviser to President Trump, ""played the United States for a sucker for far too long.""
But the complexity and depth of the relationship makes reconfiguring it fraught with risks. China is now a major world power, and its economy is tightly interwoven with America's. More than 300,000 Chinese students attend American universities. Chinese firms have invested upward of $100 billion in the United States. Apple sells more iPhones in China than in the United States, and 150,000 Boeing employees rely on its China sales for their jobs.
In the last few weeks, both President Xi Jinping and Mr. Trump have set out to show the world how different they are. On Jan. 17 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Xi defended globalization and equated protectionism with ""locking oneself in a dark room."" Mr. Trump's retort came on Jan. 20 with a fiery inauguration speech promising that in all ways he would put America first. As one of his first acts as president, Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact grouping 12 nations along the Pacific Rim, excluding China. Mr. Xi, seeking to capitalize on the folly of Mr. Trump's move, then invited those Asian neighbors abandoned by America to join a Chinese-led regional economic partnership.
There is a rich irony in both approaches. At Davos, Mr. Xi portrayed himself as the un-Trump, the last defender of globalization. It was a cynical move: China's embrace of globalization can roughly be defined as having foreigners buy as much Chinese stuff as possible and demanding that foreign firms share their technological secrets with Chinese partners so that a Chinese competitor can learn to make a product at a lower price.
For his part, Mr. Trump seems to be channeling more Mao Zedong than Andrew Jackson. Mao used the passions whipped up by China's fight with America during the Korean War as a way to bring his Communist revolution to the point of no return, to make China the un-America. A Chinese Communist Party directive in 1951 ordered that the admiration for the United States that coursed through Chinese society must be redirected into ""hate the U.S. imperialists,"" with the goal of ""encouraging national self-confidence and self-respect"" -- forever joining the yin of hating America with the yang of loving China.
The Chinese Maoist thinker Zhang Hongliang said in a recent blog post that Mr. Trump's commitment to put America first reminds him of Mao's famed 1949 speech that the ""Chinese people have stood up."" In Mr. Trump's vow to battle Washington's elite, Mr. Zhang sees Mao's promise to obliterate capitalist overlords and establish a ""people's government."" And in Mr. Trump's maddening unpredictability there are echoes of one of Mao's famous quotes: ""There is chaos under heaven, the situation is excellent.""
Mr. Trump has returned to a more negative view of the Middle Kingdom that has shadowed America's policy of benevolent solicitude since the two countries began interacting in 1784.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump's accusations that China was ""raping"" the United States over trade recalled the railings of Denis Kearney, the firebrand founder of the Workingmen's Party in 1880s California who at the end of each rally would lead the crowd in a chant, ""The Chinese must go!"" Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Kearney masterfully merged a hatred of the robber barons -- the elites of the day -- with a fear of China.
The Workingmen's Party used its heft to lobby Washington to bar Chinese people from America's shores. This coalesced in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which, in its prohibition of Chinese laborers' traveling to America, was the first time Americans targeted a specific immigrant group for exclusion from the United States. Sound familiar?
Mr. Trump's tactics mark an end to the strategy pursued for decades by American leaders who held that an open America would create a more open China. In this, he is ignoring the main lesson of the two countries' shared history: Isolating China doesn't work.
It took 61 years for the United States to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, and it did an enormous amount of hurt. It persuaded the Chinese to favor Communism over capitalism and kept the Chinese community in America isolated, small and scared.
Ignoring China in the 1950s did a similar disservice. Indeed, Mao was clearly petrified of closer ties with America, telling the Soviet ambassador in January 1955 that a lack of relations with the United States ""gives us the chance to more freely educate our people in the anti-American spirit.""
Starting a trade war with China or gearing up for a military conflict in the South China Sea will do very much the same. It will push China into a defensive crouch, validate its paranoia and allow it to nurture its anti-American fears. It will also provide Mr. Xi with the opportunity to profit from Mr. Trump's missteps, to appear statesmanlike when Mr. Trump appears bellicose, to bully Taiwan and to make China's repressive system of government seem more attractive.
Far better for Mr. Trump to use his maddening unpredictability and all the leverage available to an American president to dare China to open its society further and to become a responsible world leader. The long history that binds China and the United States should strengthen the relationship, not doom it to failure.

Task Force Urges Better U.S. Engagement With China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865602021?accountid=14586,"Â  The United States' relationship with China was strained during the Obama administration, with sharp differences over economic and trade issues, cyberattacks and Beijing's assertive maneuvers in the South China Sea.
But since taking office last month, President Trump has signaled that matters could get even more contentious, as his administration has vowed to project more military might in Asia and to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods. China could respond with its own punitive measures.
A new report by a bipartisan task force of prominent China specialists is warning of dire consequences, including the possibility of a trade war or an armed skirmish, unless the United States can find a more effective way to engage China.
The 72-page report, to be issued Tuesday by the Asia Society's Center on U.S.-China Relations and the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, urged the Trump administration to take a tougher line on China, while reaffirming principles that have guided relations between the two nations since the 1970s.
At times, the report, ""U.S. Policy Toward China: Recommendations for a New Administration,"" seemed at odds with the new president. It argued that the White House should support a trade agreement similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump has already rejected, to strengthen economic ties in Asia.
And it cautioned the administration not tamper with Washington's commitment to a One China policy -- a clear reference to the president's recent suggestion that the United States could ignore what had become a central tenet of the relationship after President Richard M. Nixon's groundbreaking trip to China in 1972.
The report urged swift action to reassure the United States' allies in Asia about its security commitments there. It also recommended that the administration initiate talks, as soon as possible, with China's leaders and develop constructive policies on what the task force identified as the six most critical areas of engagement, including efforts to halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
""We're really at a critical inflection point,"" said Orville Schell, a scholar at the Asia Society and a chairman of the task force. ""We are worried about the increasingly antagonistic relationship"" and ""think the U.S. needs to up its game in terms of the effort its puts into high-level negotiations.""
Mr. Trump has given no clear indication of how he will deal with China, but his administration has hinted at a more confrontational approach. The commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., has complained about Chinese tariffs, and Mr. Trump named Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy.
The defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has said the United States would stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with Japan and its Asian allies, which angered China. He has also given China some reassurance, however, saying on Saturday in Tokyo that military maneuvers in the South China Sea were unnecessary. Diplomacy, he said, should resolve the differences.
The task force rebuked Mr. Trump's questioning of the One China policy, by which the United States recognizes the government in Beijing, rather than that of Taiwan, as representing China.
The report said that ""it would be exceedingly dangerous to unilaterally abandon our longstanding One China policy -- an understanding that has served as the basis for the U.S. relationship with China, helped protect Taiwan's security, prosperity and democracy, and preserved peace and stability in Asia for almost four decades.""
""Across-the-board tariffs or challenging the One China policy is not the way to go,"" said Susan L. Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and a chairwoman of the task force. ""We shouldn't undervalue what we've achieved over the years -- a more or less peaceful Asia, a big market for exports and a key partner on global problems, like climate change. If it was to become unhinged, it's not just chaos in Asia but destabilizing for the global economy.""
United States-China relations have been charged for decades, particularly after the military suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989 in Beijing. But the task force said that American policies, regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican was president, had helped integrate China into the global economy and encouraged it to adhere to a rules-based international system.
But relations worsened after the 2008 financial crisis, which China withstood well with a huge stimulus package, it said. Beijing's leaders grew more hostile toward economic and military supremacy by the United States. In 2013, with Xi Jinping as president, these tendencies hardened.
Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that as China's economy grew, so did its abilities and determination, and old suspicions that the United States wanted to contain it resurfaced.
""China's goal is clear: It wants to be a regional power,"" said Mr. Li, who was not on the task force. ""Xi Jinping wants to revitalize China's glorious past. And, with the world's second-largest economy, it wants to build a stronger military.""
The task force report said the Chinese government also tightened restrictions on American internet companies, nongovernmental organizations and media outlets.
As relations between Washington and Beijing started deteriorating, the task force was formed two years ago to make recommendations for the next president. Its members included Charlene Barshefsky, a former United States trade representative; Winston Lord, a former United States ambassador to China; Kurt M. Campbell, a former State Department officer; and Evan S. Medeiros, a special assistant to President Barack Obama on Asia.
As they began to meet, consensus emerged that the United States needed to strengthen its resolve and show greater firmness in dealing with China.
The task force urged the administration to keep a strong military presence in Asia. It also said new policy and diplomatic tools, including sanctions, litigation over trade disputes and the use of reciprocal measures, were needed. For example, if China restricted investment or trade, the United States might need to do the same.
The administration should make clear its resolve to combat climate change, avoid protectionism, reaffirm the One China policy, bolster its military commitments in Asia and, effectively, stay the course, the task force said.
The task force warned that if the new administration alters the basic course that has long guided United States relations with China, it could ""destabilize not only the bilateral relationship, but also the region as a whole.""

Why U.S. Antimissile System in South Korea Worries China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1876524373?accountid=14586,"Â  BEIJING -- Mao Zedong famously dismissed the atomic bomb as a ""paper tiger,"" able to kill and terrify, but not decisive in war. Even so, China built a nuclear arsenal of its own, and now concerns about the effectiveness of that arsenal as a deterrent are driving it into confrontation with the United States over an antimissile system being built in South Korea. Here's an explanation of why.
How big is China's nuclear arsenal?
China conducted its first nuclear test in 1964, and has developed a stable of nuclear missiles. But it is not a big stable, compared with the thousands of warheads held by the United States and Russia.
China does not reveal the size of its nuclear forces. It has about 260 nuclear warheads that could be put on missiles, and by the Pentagon's latest estimate, China has between 75 and 100 intercontinental ballistic missiles. Some estimates are lower, and one recent assessment said 40 to 50 of China's ballistic missiles could reach the continental United States.
The United States has deployed about 1,370 nuclear warheads and has stockpiled more than 6,500, and has submarines and aircraft able to launch nuclear weapons.
China has also built several submarines that can launch nuclear missiles. But even its latest-model submarine ""is noisy and quite vulnerable to anti-submarine warfare,"" and therefore is not a very potent addition to its nuclear deterrent, M. Taylor Fravel, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Fiona S. Cunningham, a graduate student there, who recently published an assessment of China's nuclear modernization, said by email.
China has also been upgrading some of its missiles so that several nuclear warheads can be placed on a single missile that then unleashes them on different targets.
China has had the ability to put multiple warheads on missiles since the 1990s, but seems to have done so only recently, when some missiles were installed with three or four warheads, said Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on China's nuclear forces at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. This showed how China has been cautious in playing catch-up to the United States, he said.
""I don't think that the Chinese and U.S. have, historically, experienced the kind of tit-for-tat modernization that we saw during the U.S.-Soviet arms race,"" Mr. Lewis said. ""The Chinese more or less modernized for their own reasons and according to their own ideas.""
Why has China's nuclear arsenal stayed relatively small?
By the time China joined the nuclear club, the United States and Russia were already well ahead in building a stockpile of weapons. Mao decided to stick to a relatively small arsenal big enough to serve as a deterrent, and that decision was made a fait accompli by the political turmoil of Mao's era, which held back the nuclear weapons program.
""China's leaders thought that the important thing was to master the technology,"" Mr. Lewis said. ""While the United States did fine calculations of the deterrence balance, Chinese leaders tended to think of deterrence like a checklist of achievements.""
Ever since, Chinese nuclear doctrine has stuck to the idea of a ""minimum means of reprisal,"" with a force designed to survive and retaliate after an initial nuclear attack. Alongside that, China has a nuclear ""no first use"" policy: that it will not be the first to launch nuclear weapons against another nuclear foe, and that it will not use its nuclear weapons against a country without nuclear weapons.
Even so, China has been expanding and upgrading its nuclear forces, and that modernization may speed up if the government feels that it is falling too far behind the United States.
""China is probably confident in its ability to be able to retaliate, but given the size and sophistication of U.S. nuclear forces and the steady development of ballistic missile defenses, coupled with China's small nuclear arsenal, the margin for error is thin,"" Mr. Fravel and Ms. Cunningham said.
Why does China fear the antimissile system?
The Chinese government worries that the American antimissile system, called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, could erode its nuclear deterrent -- its ability to scare off potential foes from ever considering a nuclear attack.
Its chief worry is not that Thaad could take down missiles: the system offers a canopy of potential protection over South Korea, but does not have the reach to bring down China's intercontinental ballistic missiles. Instead, China's complaint is focused on Thaad's radar system, which Chinese experts have said could be used to track the People's Liberation Army's missile forces.
Deploying Thaad's current radar system ""would undermine China's nuclear deterrence by collecting important data on Chinese nuclear warheads,"" Li Bin, a nuclear weapons expert at Tsinghua University in Beijing, wrote last week.
He and other Chinese experts say the radar could identify which Chinese missiles are carrying decoy warheads intended to outfox foes. That would be like being able to see what cards China holds in a nuclear poker game, and that could weaken China's deterrent, they say.
""For China this is a very important point, because its missiles are limited in number to begin with,"" Wu Riqiang, a nuclear expert at Renmin University in Beijing. That meant, he said, ""China could lose its nuclear retaliatory capacity.""
For China, it does not matter that the American and South Korean governments have said Thaad is meant only to foil North Korean missiles. Mr. Wu said.
""What we worry about is the ability. It doesn't matter to us whether the United States says this is aimed at North Korea or China,"" Mr. Wu said. ""If there's this ability, then China must worry.""
Are China's fears justified?
Chinese experts are nearly unanimous in supporting Beijing's criticisms. But quite a few foreign experts say those fears are overstated or unfounded. The United States already has access to radar systems in Qatar and Taiwan able to peer at China's missile tests, and Japan has two radar systems just like the one used for Thaad, Mr. Lewis said.
""I don't see the deployment of Thaad in South Korea as a significant improvement in the ability of the U.S. to monitor Chinese missile tests,"" he said.
The Chinese government appears to have an exaggerated view of the Thaad radar's abilities, two experts, Jaganath Sankaran and Bryan L. Fearey, wrote in a recent paper. That radar is often said to have a range of about 620 miles. Some Chinese experts say its reach could be much farther.
But in practice the range could be much lower and ""not possess the ability to track Chinese strategic missile warheads/decoys,"" Mr. Sankaran and Mr. Fearey wrote. ""The Thaad radar simply cannot cover the entire or even a substantial part of the Chinese mainland.""
Even so, China's real, underlying worry appears to be that Thaad could open the door to a much wider, more advanced fence of antimissile systems arrayed around it by America's allies, several experts said. That would magnify Chinese worries about the effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent, and entrench Chinese fears of encirclement by a coalition knit together by a shared antimissile system.
""I think this is what really worries them, because then what you have is the basis for a common interoperable system,"" said Michael J. Green, the former senior director for Asia in the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. ""I think it's more about the creation of a virtual collective security system,"" he said of China's worries about Thaad.
Will China alter its nuclear policy in response to Thaad?
Last week, the Global Times, a stridently nationalist Chinese newspaper, warned in an editorial that China could consider abandoning its ""no first use"" policy if Thaad leads to other antimissile systems deemed threatening to China.
But for now at least such threats are bluster, said many experts. China is far from taking a dramatic step like abandoning its bedrock nuclear policy, they said.
""I don't see 'no first use' going soon -- at least most responsible officers and officials stick to the policy, despite ongoing debate behind the scenes,"" said Douglas H. Paal, a China expert who worked on the National Security Council under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
Instead, China is likely to respond by spending more on its nuclear, missile and antimissile forces ""to ensure survivability of a second-strike force, and expanded penetration aids and decoys to defeat U.S. missile defenses in the event of a second strike,"" Mr. Paal said.
In the shorter term, China may accelerate the introduction of a new generation of missiles, the Dongfeng-41, which can be moved around on roads and will also be able to carry multiple warheads, said Mr. Fravel and Ms. Cunningham.
China is also working on a ""glide technology to alter the trajectory of a warhead as it nears its target, which could be used to overcome U.S. missile defenses in the long term,"" they said.

How Trump Can Solve His Chinese Puzzle,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.l ib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1884195238?accountid=14586,"Â  Getting tough with China is a central part of Donald Trump's plan to ""make America great again."" During the election campaign, he claimed that China was ""raping"" American industry. Since the election, he and senior aides have denounced Chinese policies over trade, North Korea and the South China Sea.
These facts alone would make President Trump's summit meeting this week with China's president, Xi Jinping, very difficult. It is not that confrontation with China should be feared for its own sake. The real danger is that Mr. Trump's China policies are likely to be counterproductive, damaging America's prosperity and endangering its security, while hastening the rise of China.
Mr. Trump's erratic approach to security issues scares American allies, making them less likely to stand with the United States if it confronts China over North Korea or the South China Sea. At the same time, the president's protectionism, demonstrated by his decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, will reduce America's economic role in Asia. As a result, America's traditional partners in the region will increasingly be tempted to look to Beijing, rather than Washington, for a lead.
The underlying problem is that a tough-guy approach to Asia belongs to a bygone age when America's economic and strategic dominance was unquestioned. The rise of China has changed the balance of power in the region. The United States needs the help of allies and trading partners to manage a more assertive China -- the very allies Mr. Trump's policies threaten to alienate.
China is now the world's largest manufacturer, largest exporter and largest market for vehicles, smartphones and oil. In 2014, the International Monetary Fund announced that China had become the largest economy in the world, measured by purchasing power. By then, China had also become the biggest export market for 43 countries in the world; the United States was the biggest market for just 32 countries. And this year, Germany announced that China is now its largest trading partner.
This shift of economic power, a process I call ""Easternization,"" has increased China's geopolitical clout. All of America's most important partners in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, Australia and South Korea, still look to the United States for protection. But their most important economic relationships are all now with China. That gives Beijing real leverage, which Mr. Xi's government is increasingly prepared to use.
Some traditional American allies show signs of defecting. During a visit to Beijing last year, the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, announced a ""separation"" from the United States and a new relationship with China. Filipino officials cite Chinese loans, infrastructure investment and fruit imports to explain why their country has modulated its criticism of Beijing's maritime claims in the South China Sea. As the defense minister said this week, ""any product that we produce, they will buy.""
China is also more prepared to use economic and diplomatic threats against American allies. To put pressure on Seoul not to cooperate with the deployment of an American antimissile shield, Beijing recently canceled contracts with prominent South Korean companies.
Even Australia is feeling the heat. On a recent trip there, China's prime minister, Li Keqiang, warned Australia not to take sides in any dispute between America and China -- a remarkable intervention, given that Australians fought alongside Americans in two world wars, as well as the Korean and Vietnam wars. But no Australian government can afford to ignore Beijing's wishes, given China's significance as a trading partner and investor. In 2015, a Chinese company bought a 100-year lease on the port of Darwin on Australia's northern coast -- to the consternation of the Obama administration, which had chosen the location for a new Marine Corps training facility.
Neither South Korea nor Australia has yet gone as far as the Philippines, but there is a serious debate in both countries about their future relations with the United States. Their doubts will only increase thanks to Mr. Trump's frequent questioning of such alliances.
""I believe in relationships,"" he told The Financial Times last weekend. ""And I believe in partnerships. But alliances have not always worked out very well for us. O.K.?""
Faced with a delicate situation in Asia, America must adopt intelligent policies that reassure its partners. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has done the precise opposite: targeting countries that run big import surpluses with the United States with a review of ""trade abuses"" and threatening retaliatory measures. That move is a threat not just to China, but also to vital allies like South Korea and Japan.
The president has also shown an unnerving unpredictability on security issues. His strong hints that the United States would entertain the idea of a first strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities will not be welcome in Seoul, which is just 35 miles from the North Korean border and could be devastated by retaliatory strikes. Mr. Trump has also demonstrated a willingness to risk war with China over both Taiwan and the South China Sea, conflicts that none of America's allies (with the possible exception of Japan) would welcome.
As tensions mount, nations in the region must feel able to trust Mr. Trump's judgment and his word. So far, the president has given them little reason to do so. Any suggestion now of a trade war with China -- or worse, a shooting war -- would horrify most of Asia. So, too, would any hint of a grand bargain with Beijing that involved trading away American allies' interests in return for trade concessions for the United States from China.
In his meeting with Mr. Xi this week, Mr. Trump needs to send a carefully balanced message -- not easy for a president who doesn't do nuance -- to reassure America's Asian allies that it will stand by them, and stand up to China without taking reckless steps. If the president fails to offer such reassurance, America's position in Asia will continue to erode.

When Solar Panels Became Job Killers,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1885293397?accountid=14586,"Â  WUHAN, China -- Russell Abney raised two children on solar power. The 49-year-old Georgia Tech graduate worked for the last decade in Perrysburg, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, pulling a good salary as an equipment engineer for the largest American solar-panel maker.
On the other side of the world, Gao Song boasted his own solar success story. A former organic fruit retailer who lives in the dusty Chinese city of Wuhan, he installed solar panels on his roof four years ago and found it so lucrative that he went into business installing them for others. By last summer, he and a team of 50 employees were installing solar-panel systems on nearly 100 roofs a month.
Then China shook the global solar business -- and transformed both their lives.
""A small vibration back in China,"" said Frank Haugwitz, a longtime solar industry consultant in Beijing, ""can cause an avalanche in prices around the world.""
Late last summer, Chinese officials began publicly toying with slashing the subsidies they offer domestic solar-panel buyers. Mr. Gao's business dried up, and he laid off half his workers. ""I have been working hard and was just off to a good start,"" he said. ""Now I have to start over.""
China's solar-panel makers cut their prices by more than a quarter to compensate, sending global prices plummeting. Western companies found themselves unable to compete, and cut jobs from Germany to Michigan to Texas and points beyond.
Those points included Perrysburg -- where Mr. Abney and about 450 other employees suddenly found themselves out of work. ""Within just a few months, it all came crashing down,"" Mr. Abney said. ""It's like a death in the family. People feel awkward talking about it.""
President Trump, who pressed President Xi Jinping of China on trade and other issues this week when they met at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., has vowed to end what he calls China's unfair business practices. Much of his oratory has involved old-fashioned smokestack industries like steel -- industries in which the jobs were already disappearing even before the rise of China.
But economists and business groups warn that China's industrial ambitions have entered a new, far-reaching phase. With its deep government pockets, growing technical sophistication and a comprehensive plan to free itself from dependence on foreign companies, China aims to become dominant in industries of the future like renewable energy, big data and self-driving cars.
With solar, it has already happened. China is now home to two-thirds of the world's solar-production capacity. The efficiency with which its products convert sunlight into electricity is increasingly close to that of panels made by American, German and South Korean companies. Because China also buys half of the world's new solar panels, it now effectively controls the market.
For much of the past century, the ups and downs of the American economy could spell the difference between employment or poverty for people like Chilean copper miners and Malaysian rubber farmers. Now China's policy shifts and business decisions can have the same kind of global impact once wielded by power brokers in Washington, New York and Detroit.
The story of China's rise in solar panels illustrates the profound difficulties the country presents to Mr. Trump, or to any American president. Its size and fast-moving economy give it the ability to redefine industries almost on a dime. Its government-led pursuit of dominance in crucial industries presents a direct challenge to countries where leaders generally leave business decisions to the businesses themselves.
Already, China is the world's largest maker and buyer of steel, cars and smartphones. While it does not necessarily dominate those industries, its government ministries are moving to replicate that success with robots, chips and software -- just as in solar.
Chinese panel makers ""have the capital, they have the technology, they have the scale,"" said Ocean Yuan, the chief executive of Grape Solar, a distributor of solar panels based in Eugene, Ore. Of American rivals, he said, ""they will crush them.""
Rooted in Fish
Before he became one of the solar industry's most powerful players, Liu Hanyuan raised fish.
The son of peasants from China's hardscrabble southwest, Mr. Liu sold some of the family's pigs in 1983 for what was then around $100 to buy some fish. Soon he went into the even more lucrative business of selling fish feed, and he eventually moved into pig feed and duck feed. The brand name, Keli, is a combination of the first and last Chinese characters from a famous paraphrasing of Karl Marx by Deng Xiaoping, the father of modern China: Science and technology are primary productive forces.
According to Mr. Liu's authorized biography, he faced local criticism at first for his early embrace of capitalism, and responded by saying that his fish feed was an improved product that followed Deng's dictum. ""When my business grows bigger,"" he said at the time, ""I will build another floor for labs.""
Plans to shift into computer chips did not pan out, so by 2006, he shifted to solar technology, after taking control of a company that made chemicals for the production of polysilicon, the crystalline raw material for solar panels. That move proved fortunate: China was just then embarking on a concerted effort to become a solar-industry powerhouse.
Over the next six years, Beijing pushed state-owned banks to provide at least $18 billion in loans at low-interest rates to solar-panel manufacturers, and encouraged local governments to subsidize them with cheap land. China had more on its mind than just dominating solar exports: Its severe pollution problems and concerns that rising sea levels from climate change could devastate its teeming coastal cities lent urgency to efforts to develop green technology. At the same time, China also became a major player in wind power through similar policies.
With ample assistance, China's solar-power production capacity expanded more than tenfold from 2007 to 2012. Now six of the top 10 solar-panel makers are Chinese, including the top two, compared with none a decade ago. The solar division of Mr. Liu's company, the Tongwei Group, which discloses few financial details, is one of the fastest-expanding players in the industry.
That growth forced many American and European solar-panel manufacturers into a headlong retreat. Two dozen of them filed for bankruptcy or cut back operations during President Barack Obama's first term, damaging the heady optimism then about clean energy.
In 2012 and 2013, the United States and the European Union concluded that Chinese solar-panel makers were collecting government subsidies and dumping panels, or selling them for less than the cost of producing and shipping them. Both imposed import limits. Chinese manufacturers and officials denied improper subsidies and dumping, and still do.
Several large Chinese manufacturers that had previously overexpanded and had been selling at heavy losses for years then closed their doors. But Western solar companies say Chinese banks still lent heavily to the survivors despite low loan-recovery rates from the defaults of big Chinese solar companies like Suntech, Chaori and LDK Solar.
""The main subsidy is massive, below-market loans by Chinese state-owned commercial banks to finance new capacity and also the massive ongoing losses of Chinese companies,"" said JÃ¼rgen Stein, the president of American operations for SolarWorld, a big German panel maker.
Li Junfeng, a top architect of China's renewable-energy policies until he retired from that responsibility in early January, said that the West had exaggerated the role of the state in helping to finance Chinese solar-panel manufacturers. ""The market can decide for itself,"" he said. ""The good companies can get money, the bad companies cannot.""
High-Tech Hopes
Like the Chinese solar industry as a whole, Tongwei is thinking bigger.
Mr. Liu's company bought an enormous solar-panel manufacturing complex in central China in 2013 from LDK Solar, which had run into severe financial difficulties. Now it plans to build factories of five gigawatts apiece in the Chinese cities of Chengdu and Hefei. By comparison, the entire global market is only about 77 gigawatts each year, while world capacity is 139 gigawatts.
At the same time, Mr. Liu is dismissive of companies in the West that pioneered many solar technologies but have lost their market shares to China. ""They are very jealous,"" he said, ""and cannot catch up with China's pace.""
From an environmental standpoint, China's solar push has been good for the world. Solar-panel prices have fallen close to 90 percent over the past decade. Many of the solar panels in America's backyards and solar power plants are made by Chinese companies.
But for the solar industry, Chinese expansion could mean an extended period of low prices and cutbacks for everybody else.
""The solar industry is facing again, I would say, a new winter,"" said Patrick PouyannÃ©, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas giant, which owns a controlling stake in SunPower, an American solar-panel maker.
China now hopes to replicate its solar industry's growth in other areas.
Under a plan called Made in China 2025, China hopes to become largely self-sufficient within seven years in a long list of industries, including aircraft, high-speed trains, computer chips and robots. The plan echoes the solar-panel and wind-turbine buildup a decade ago, but with a larger checkbook. Made in China 2025 calls for roughly $300 billion in financial backing: inexpensive loans from state-owned banks, investment funds to acquire foreign technologies, and extensive research subsidies.
If successful, Made in China 2025 would represent a fundamental shift in how China deals with the world. Initially, most of the industries that moved to China, such as shoe and clothing production, were already leaving the United States anyway. Heavy industries such as steel followed. While the shift was profound -- some economists estimate that up to 2.4 million American jobs were lost to China from 1999 to 2011, though others dispute that analysis -- China has struggled in some areas like autos to create viable global competitors.
American and European business groups have warned that the China 2025 plan means that a much wider range of Western businesses will face the same kind of government-backed competition that has already transformed the solar industry.
""The policies started in solar and are now starting to infect the higher reaches of the economy with Made in China 2025,"" said Jeremie Waterman, the president of the China Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
Ripples From Wuhan
In the end, China did not slash subsidies for rooftop solar panels, and cut them only slightly for large power-plant arrays. But prices barely rebounded from last year's slump.
Mr. Gao, of Wuhan, is a slender 37-year-old whose dark hair is already thinning. He said that his business had depended not on homeowners but on profit-minded investors who made use of the subsidies.
The investors would pay three-fifths of the cost of a homeowner's system. The homeowner would take only enough electricity from the panels to power the home. The investor would sell the rest of the electricity to the grid at a high, government-assisted price.
The suggestion that the government might cut the subsidy, even though the government did not follow through on it, panicked his investors. So they stopped financing further deals.
""They fear that the year after next, they may have nothing,"" he said. He recently hired four more employees to drum up sales, even as installations creep along at a small fraction of demand a year ago.
In Perrysburg, Mr. Abney lost his job at First Solar, the largest solar-panel manufacturer based in the United States, and looked in vain for a job in the auto industry in the Toledo area. He ended up taking a job three weeks ago at a building materials company in Lancaster, Pa. His daughter is going off to college in the autumn, while his wife and son, a high school freshman now, will follow him to central Pennsylvania this summer.
""It's hardest on him because we're pulling him away from his high school and his activities,"" Mr. Abney said.
First Solar struggled with improving Chinese technology as well as dropping prices.
It laid off workers in Perrysburg partly because it decided not to produce its Series 5 generation of panels, which represented a limited improvement over its existing Series 4 panels. First Solar, to better compete with Chinese producers, will wait for its lower-cost, high-efficiency Series 6 panels to be ready for production in 2018. In the end, First Solar, which is based in Tempe, Ariz., laid off 1,600 people worldwide.
""It's just kind of a shock factor when a lot of families realize they're no longer going to have a job,"" said Michael Olmstead, the Republican mayor of Perrysburg.
Though Mr. Abney has started his new job at almost the same pay as his previous one, he says part of him pined for the days when the United States still led in solar energy, and when First Solar was at the forefront of that leadership.
""They were good for us,"" he said. ""And it was great while it lasted.""

"Trump Targets Steel Trade, but China Will Be Tough to Contain","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1890265231?accountid=14586,"Â  HANGZHOU, China -- China's vast steel industry is a major target of President Trump. But this hulking shell of a mill here shows why China is likely to keep pumping out more and more steel, inflaming trade tensions between the two countries.
The Hangzhou steel mill, a vast labyrinth of blast furnaces, warehouses, chimneys and worker dormitories covering hundreds of acres, was one of Mao Zedong's favorite projects. Built in just 13 months in the late 1950s, it once employed 25,000 workers.
Pollution and the march of progress made the mill a liability. But closing a mill eliminates well-paying jobs -- a central reason China keeps factories churning out steel the world doesn't need.
When authorities do manage to shutter a plant, it is a costly ordeal, as the story of Hangzhou shows. With the help of a $34 million grant from government officials, the Hangzhou plant owner, Hangzhou Iron and Steel Group, offered the 12,000 remaining workers lavish severance benefits and pensions.
""I don't have to wake up early,"" said Tang Guomin, 49, who had labored at the blast furnaces since he was 18 years old. He received nearly six years' pay from the company as severance and when he turns 50 in a few months, he will be able to collect an inflation-adjusted pension from the government equal to 90 percent of his previous pay for the rest of his life.
""I sleep till I wake and don't have much to worry about,"" he said, while doing his family's morning vegetable shopping at a street market. ""I miss the factory, but that time won't be back again.""
Invoking an obscure trade law, President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday for a 270-day review to determine whether steel imports were harming national security. If the Commerce Department does find harm, Mr. Trump will have up to 90 days to decide whether to impose broad import restrictions.
China is an obvious target of the order, though the impact could ripple worldwide. While only about 2 percent of American steel imports come directly from China, global steel makers and industry experts blame China for shipping its surplus steel to other countries, which drives down prices and prompts those countries to further process the steel into high-value products for export to the United States. The Trump administration, which has made it clear that it will take a more aggressive stance on steel, has suggested it could bring trade actions against those countries as well.
China denies that it sells excess steel to other markets below the cost of making it, a move called dumping. But China does concede that it has too many steel factories making too much steel.
The trick is trimming that excess capacity, which is proving to be neither easy nor cheap. Steel making represents a reliable source of high-wage jobs in a country where economic growth has slowed compared with previous years. Steel also remains a key material for China's manufacturing sector, the world's largest.
""Steel is the food for China's industry,"" said Wang Guoqing, the research director at the Lange Steel Information Research Center, a Chinese industry group in Beijing. ""It is in a key position for China's development and infrastructure.""
The steel industry in the United States employs about 140,000 people, or less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the American work force. China's steel makers, by contrast, employed 4.7 million workers in 2014, the last official figure released, or 0.6 percent of China's labor force then. Nearly 60 years after Mao's drive to make China a steel giant contributed to a famine that killed millions of people, the country now makes as much steel as the rest of the world put together.
Today, China's steel sector represents the sort of bloated, wasteful industry that people both inside and outside the country say is holding back economic development. China in early 2016 committed to closing steel mills representing 100 million to 150 million tons of capacity over five years, or roughly a tenth of its capacity then. China closed 65 million tons of capacity last year and plans to close another 50 million tons this year, according to a speech in early March by Premier Li Keqiang.
Yet production remains stubbornly high, and new mills have continued to open. China's steel mills produced a record quantity of steel last month. China hasn't released more recent data on total steel capacity.
For now, China's steel exports are shrinking, though it isn't clear how long that will continue. China's appetite for steel has improved in recent months as government lending and spending and a revival in its property industry lift the economy and encourage consumption. But the government has said it wants to rein in lending, concerned that the economy may be too reliant on ever-rising debt.
Mr. Trump's advisers are using steel as part of a broader push against China's excess factories. They are singling out steel while blaming Chinese industrial policies for overcapacity in other sectors, like aluminum and solar panels.
""To me the objective is to make it uneconomic, to make it expensive, to do something that has inefficiency in the market,"" said Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump's nominee to become United States trade representative, at his Senate confirmation hearing.
China calls that effort shortsighted, saying it has made itself an indispensable provider of high-quality steel to the world at a time when many American steel mills are aging. Advocates of a more confrontational American trade policy fail to understand this, said Li Xinchuang, the dean of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, a government agency.
""I have explained this time and time again, but they won't listen,"" he said. ""It's like playing the lute to a cow.""
The Hangzhou steel plant, and the city that it is named after, represent China's effort to shift its economy away from industries like steel. The city of at least 4 million urban residents is the hometown of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, and also contains the headquarters of Geely, the Chinese automaker that bought Volvo from Ford in 2010.
The former factory looks a little like a postapocalyptic scene on a Hollywood movie set: cavernous warehouses moldered on a damp spring day, windowless and doorless. Conveyor belts and other steel equipment that might have scrap metal value had already been removed, leaving barren concrete tubes and walls. A long row of black hopper cars rusted on a railroad siding.
Migrant construction laborers camped in the evening in a dilapidated, three-story concrete building, resting after a long day of tearing apart old buildings as the next step in clearing the site. Tall grass, leafy bushes and even small trees had begun growing vigorously in open areas of the factory, sometimes pushing their way up through cracks in concrete plazas.
""It looks beautiful,"" said Le Rong, a 42-year-old migrant worker involved in dismantling the complex. ""I even told my wife and kids about it.""
A Hangzhou Iron and Steel spokesman declined to discuss what the company would do with the site, saying it had not yet been decided but that the company would find an ""innovative"" use for the land. Former steel mill sites in other prosperous Chinese cities like Hangzhou have often been redeveloped as real estate projects.
Some of China's steel plants are outdated and many of them are polluting. Revamping them isn't cheap. In addition to the $34 million it received to close the Hangzhou plant, Hangzhou Iron and Steel in 2015 received nearly $106 million in subsidies and cheap government loans to help cover overall costs of upgrading its plants.
For many locals, closing the mill has meant cleaner air -- the reason officials said the mill was shut down.
State-run media said shortly before the Hangzhou mill closed that the aging site had been releasing 7,000 tons a year of sulfur dioxide, an important cause of acid rain, and 3,000 tons a year of soot.
Xu Yuemei, another retired steelworker, said that when the factory was still operating, garments that she hung on a clothesline turned black or yellow before they dried. Mr. Tang remembers a pervasive haze.
""There was dust in the air; I couldn't see guys 100 meters away from me,"" he recalled. ""I could smell choking ammonia gas in the air until the factory shut down.""
""After it shut down,"" he said, ""everything is gone, including the pollution.""

Behind China's $1 Trillion Plan to Shake Up the Economic Order,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1898694498?accountid=14586,"Â  VANG VIENG, Laos -- Along the jungle-covered mountains of Laos, squads of Chinese engineers are drilling hundreds of tunnels and bridges to support a 260-mile railway, a $6 billion project that will eventually connect eight Asian countries.
Chinese money is building power plants in Pakistan to address chronic electricity shortages, part of an expected $46 billion worth of investment.
Chinese planners are mapping out train lines from Budapest to Belgrade, Serbia, providing another artery for Chinese goods flowing into Europe through a Chinese-owned port in Greece.
The massive infrastructure projects, along with hundreds of others across Asia, Africa and Europe, form the backbone of China's ambitious economic and geopolitical agenda. President Xi Jinping of China is literally and figuratively forging ties, creating new markets for the country's construction companies and exporting its model of state-led development in a quest to create deep economic connections and strong diplomatic relationships.
The initiative, called ""One Belt, One Road,"" looms on a scope and scale with little precedent in modern history, promising more than $1 trillion in infrastructure and spanning more than 60 countries. To celebrate China's new global influence, Mr. Xi is gathering dozens of state leaders, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in Beijing on Sunday.
It is global commerce on China's terms.
Mr. Xi is aiming to use China's wealth and industrial know-how to create a new kind of globalization that will dispense with the rules of the aging Western-dominated institutions. The goal is to refashion the global economic order, drawing countries and companies more tightly into China's orbit.
The projects inherently serve China's economic interests. With growth slowing at home, China is producing more steel, cement and machinery than the country needs. So Mr. Xi is looking to the rest of the world, particularly developing countries, to keep its economic engine going.
""President Xi believes this is a long-term plan that will involve the current and future generations to propel Chinese and global economic growth,"" said Cao Wenlian, director general of the International Cooperation Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, a group dedicated to the initiative. ""The plan is to lead the new globalization 2.0.""
Mr. Xi is rolling out a more audacious version of the Marshall Plan, America's postwar reconstruction effort. Back then, the United States extended vast amounts of aid to secure alliances in Europe. China is deploying hundreds of billions of dollars of state-backed loans in the hope of winning new friends around the world, this time without requiring military obligations.
Mr. Xi's plan stands in stark contrast to President Trump and his ""America First"" mantra. The Trump administration walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the American-led trade pact that was envisioned as a buttress against China's growing influence.
""Pursuing protectionism is just like locking oneself in a dark room,"" Mr. Xi told business leaders at the World Economic Forum in January.
As head of the Communist Party, Mr. Xi is promoting global leadership in China's own image, emphasizing economic efficiency and government intervention. And China is corralling all manner of infrastructure projects under the plan's broad umbrella, without necessarily ponying up the funds.
China is moving so fast and thinking so big that it is willing to make short-term missteps for what it calculates to be long-term gains. Even financially dubious projects in corruption-ridden countries like Pakistan and Kenya make sense for military and diplomatic reasons.
The United States and many of its major European and Asian allies have taken a cautious approach to the project, leery of bending to China's strategic goals. Some, like Australia, have rebuffed Beijing's requests to sign up for the plan. Despite projects on its turf, India is uneasy because Chinese-built roads will run through disputed territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
But it is impossible for any foreign leader, multinational executive or international banker to ignore China's push to remake global trade.
Germany's minister of economics and energy, Brigitte Zypries, plans to attend the meeting in Beijing. Western industrial giants like General Electric and Siemens are coming, as they look for lucrative contracts and try to stay in China's good graces.
The Trump administration just upgraded its participation.
Originally, it planned to send a Commerce Department official, Eric Branstad, the son of the incoming American ambassador to Beijing, Terry Branstad. Now, Matthew Pottinger, senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, will attend instead -- a signal that the White House is enhancing its warm relationship with Mr. Xi by honoring his favorite endeavor with the presence of a top official.
Influence Via Infrastructure
As the sun beat down on Chinese workers driving bulldozers, four huge tractor-trailers rolled into a storage area here in Vang Vieng, a difficult three-hour drive over potholed roads from the capital, Vientiane. They each carried massive coils of steel wire.
Half a mile away, a Chinese cement mixing plant with four bays glistened in the sun. Nearby, along a newly laid road, another Chinese factory was providing cement for tunnel construction.
Nearly everything for the Laos project is made in China. Almost all the labor force is Chinese. At the peak of construction, there will be an estimated 100,000 Chinese workers.
When Mr. Xi announced the ""One Belt, One Road"" plan in September 2013, it was clear that Beijing needed to do something for the industries that had succeeded in building China's new cities, railways and roads -- state-led investment that turned it into an economic powerhouse. China did not have a lot left to build, and growth started to sputter.
Along with the economic boost, tiny Laos, a landlocked country with six million people, is a linchpin in Beijing's strategy to chip away at American power in Southeast Asia. After Mr. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership in January, American influence in the region is seen to be waning. The rail line through Laos would provide a link to countries that China wants to bring firmly into its fold.
Each nation in Mr. Xi's plan brings its own strategic advantages.
The power plants in Pakistan, as well as upgrades to a major highway and a $1 billion port expansion, are a political bulwark. By prompting growth in Pakistan, China wants to blunt the spread of Pakistan's terrorists across the border into the Xinjiang region, where a restive Muslim population of Uighurs resides. It has military benefits, providing China's navy future access to a remote port at Gwadar managed by a state-backed Chinese company with a 40-year contract.
Many countries in the program have serious needs. The Asian Development Bank estimated that emerging Asian economies need $1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure to maintain growth, tackle poverty and respond to climate change.
In Kenya, China is upgrading a railway from the port of Mombasa to Nairobi that will make it easier to get Chinese goods into the country. The Kenyan government had been unable to persuade others to do the job, whereas China has been transforming crumbling infrastructure in Africa for more than a decade.
The rail line, which is set to start running next month, is the first to be built to Chinese standards outside China. The country will benefit for years from maintenance contracts.
""China's Belt and Road initiative is starting to deliver useful infrastructure, bringing new trade routes and better connectivity to Asia and Europe,"" said Tom Miller, author of ""China's Asian Dream: Empire Building Along the New Silk Road."" ""But Xi will struggle to persuade skeptical countries that the initiative is not a smokescreen for strategic control.""
Calculating the Risks
Although Chinese engineers just started arriving in this tourist town several months ago, they have started punching three tunnels into mountains that slope down to roiling river water. They are in a race to get as much done as possible before the monsoon rains next month slow down work.
It is a fast start to a much-delayed program that may bring only limited benefits to the agrarian country.
For years, Laos and China sparred over financing. With the cost running at nearly $6 billion, officials in Laos wondered how they would afford their share. The country's output is just $12 billion annually. A feasibility study by a Chinese company said the railway would lose money for the first 11 years.
Such friction is characteristic.
In Indonesia, construction of a high-speed railway between Jakarta and Bandung finally began last month after arguments over land acquisition. In Thailand, the government is demanding better terms for a vital railway.
China's outlays for the plan so far have been modest: Only $50 billion has been spent, an ""extremely small"" amount relative to China's domestic investment program, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Even China's good friends so far are left wanting. Mr. Xi attended a groundbreaking ceremony in 2014 in Tajikistan for a gas pipeline, but the project stalled after Beijing's demand waned.
Mr. Putin will be at the center of the Beijing conference. While two companies owned by one of his closest friends, Gennady Timchenko, have benefited from projects, there has not been much else for Russia.
""Russia's elites' high expectations regarding Belt and Road have gone through a severe reality check, and now oligarchs and officials are skeptical about practical results,"" said Alexander Gabuev, senior associate at the Carnegie Center in Moscow.
China is making calculations that the benefits will outweigh the risks.
The investments could complicate Beijing's effort to stem the exodus of capital outflow that have been weighing on the economy. The cost could also come back to haunt China, whose banks are being pressed to lend to projects that they find less than desirable. By some estimates, over half the countries that have accepted Belt and Road projects have credit ratings below investment grade.
""A major constraint in investor enthusiasm,"" said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, ""is that many countries in the Central Asian region, where the initial thrust of the initiative is focused, suffer from weak and unstable economies, poor public governance, political stability and corruption.""
Laos is one of the risky partners. The Communist government is a longstanding friend of China. But fearing China's domination, Laos is casting around for other friends as well, including China's regional rivals Japan and Vietnam.
After five years of negotiations over the rail line, Laos finally got a better deal. Laos has an $800 million loan from China's Export-Import Bank and agreed to form a joint venture with China that will borrow much of the rest.
Still, Laos faces a huge debt burden. The International Monetary Fund warned this year that the country's reserves stood at two months of prospective imports of goods and services. It also expressed concerns that public debt could rise to around 70 percent of the economy.
As construction gathers steam, nearby communities are starting to rumble.
Farmers are balking at giving up their land. Some members of the national assembly have raised questions about property rights.
At Miss Mai's Noodle Shop here, a customer, Mr. Sipaseuth, who said he used only one name, pondered the project over a glass of icy Beer Lao.
In the past, he said, the government had promised $10 for an acre of land worth about $100. ""But then they never paid it,"" Mr. Sipaseuth added.
Was the rail project good for Laos?
""We need civilization. Laos is very poor, very underdeveloped,"" he said. ""But how many Chinese will come here? Too many is not a good idea.""

"China Is Reluctant to Blame North Korea, Its Ally, for Cyberattack","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1899831088?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG -- North Korea tests nuclear weapons less than 100 miles from China's border. It launched a missile hours before a major speech by President Xi Jinping of China on Sunday, a move Chinese analysts called a diplomatic slap in the face. Its counterfeiting of Chinese and American currency costs China millions of dollars a year.
North Korea's history of erratic behavior has embarrassed China in many ways. But through it all, China has remained stoic about its neighbor and ally.
As evidence mounts that North Korea may have links to a ransomware attack that destroyed more than 200,000 computers globally -- and hit 40,000 institutions in China -- China's response has been muted. Which raises the question: How far can North Korea go without getting disciplined by its more powerful neighbor?
China has been one of the biggest victims of the attack, which crippled computers at universities, major businesses and local governments, adding a potentially dangerous new element to a relationship that has increasingly tested Chinese leaders.
""North Korea has been a constant threat in terms of missiles and nuclear weapons,"" said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University. ""All of a sudden, it poses a cyber threat.""
He added: ""This time if it's from North Korea, the malware was targeted indiscriminately against all computers. That's a big change. It harms and threatens China.""
Amid these tensions, Beijing is not eager to call attention to its deteriorating relations with its longtime ally. North Korea's missile launch took place hours before Mr. Xi addressed an international gathering in Beijing to promote China's ""One Belt, One Road"" project -- an enormous infrastructure undertaking that is expected to build projects in Asia, Europe and Africa.
Even though the timing of the launch suggested it was a deliberate ploy to embarrass Mr. Xi at an inopportune time, it was not reported in the Chinese state media.
Regarding the ransomware attack, China analysts say Beijing will hesitate before directly casting blame on North Korea even if evidence, still inconclusive, directly ties the North to the attack. Beijing is more likely to single out other actors, particularly the United States, experts say.
The attack took advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows software through a tool stolen from the United States' National Security Agency. That plays into broader Chinese concerns about its overreliance on American software.
China's influence over North Korea's hacking efforts has been significant. By some accounts, the idea to experiment with cyberattacks came to North Korea from China.
Initially, the North Korean government viewed the internet as a threat. But in the early 1990s, a group of computer experts returned from China with the idea of using the web to take secrets and attack government enemies, according to one defector.
Since then, North Korean hackers have attended schools in China and used it as a staging ground for attacks. As North Korea devoted more resources to those efforts -- eventually selecting child math prodigies for training and assembling an army of more than 6,000 -- it established a large outpost for its secretive hacking unit in China.
Security analysts say North Korean hackers operate out of hotels, restaurants and internet cafes in northeastern Chinese cities like Shenyang and Dandong, which are outposts for trade with North Korea. Though many still operate in China, North Korean hackers have increasingly moved further afield, to countries in Southeast Asia, where government surveillance and control is less strict.
The moves are also intended to protect cyberattack options in the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula. Security analysts say some attacks are also carried out from North Korea, but are limited by the fact that the country has only one main portal to the internet, through China's state telecom operator China Unicom.
Despite evidence suggesting a North Korean role in the ransomware attack, the most common reaction among experts and on Chinese social media was to blame the United States.
""Many criticized the U.S. government, saying that it was responsible for this spread of ransomware. Obviously this accusation is reasonable,"" the editor in chief of state-run Global Times wrote in a prominent commentary on Monday.
""Attacks always happen,"" said Chen Zhong, a professor in computer science at Peking University. ""What catches our eyes this time is that the attack used a tool that leaked from the N.S.A.,"" he said.
On the social media site Weibo, users almost uniformly blamed the United States for the attack.
""Hell, if North Korea could do this they would have showed it off long ago,"" said one user. ""North Korea would have become a major power if they can pull this off,"" said another.
But Mr. Cheng of Renmin University said that if events more definitively linked the attack to North Korea, it was likely to pose a new test to China's increasingly rocky relationship with Pyongyang.
""Since North Korea started its nuclear program in 2006, China-North Korea relations have gradually deteriorated, and are currently at an abnormal level. If we add another virus, the image of North Korea in the eyes of China will be even worse.""
China's news organizations, both state-run and private, reported on the hacking attacks, as well as the possible links to North Korea, hours after it occurred, but they did so in a controlled fashion that was confined to inside pages of newspapers, and played in modest ways on websites.
Still, several news portals wrote that cybersecurity firms like Kaspersky Lab had found initial evidence that pointed to North Korea. The news portal Sina pointed to previous attacks - in Bangladesh, against Sony and the South Korean subway - that may have originated from the North.
Should the evidence against North Korea mount, it would add to other indignities China has suffered at the hands of its neighbor.
Over the years, North Korea has flooded northeastern China with counterfeit $100 bills of American currency. It has also mass manufactured counterfeit Chinese renminbi, but China says little about the problem.
This year, South Korea accused the North of assassinating the half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, at the international airport in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The relative, Kim Jong-nam, was considered a friend of China and he had lived in the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau, where he was protected by state security.
Chinese state-run media reported on the killing but refrained from associating Mr. Kim, the half brother, with China.
In 2013, an uncle of Kim Jong-un, who was the main financial conduit between China and the North, was executed by a firing squad that used antiaircraft guns, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service.
South Korean intelligence said the killing of the uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was ordered by Mr. Kim as he was consolidating power over North Korea. His death meant that China lost its most important interlocutor with the North, and was an early signal from Mr. Kim that under his rule relations between China and North Korea would not be business as usual. But China withstood the insult without public recrimination.

Is China Outsmarting America in A.I.?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1902909202?accountid=14586,"Â  HONG KONG -- SÃ¶ren Schwertfeger finished his postdoctorate research on autonomous robots in Germany, and seemed set to go to Europe or the United States, where artificial intelligence was pioneered and established.
Instead, he went to China.
""You couldn't have started a lab like mine elsewhere,"" Mr. Schwertfeger said.
The balance of power in technology is shifting. China, which for years watched enviously as the West invented the software and the chips powering today's digital age, has become a major player in artificial intelligence, what some think may be the most important technology of the future. Experts widely believe China is only a step behind the United States.
China's ambitions mingle the most far-out sci-fi ideas with the needs of an authoritarian state: Philip K. Dick meets George Orwell. There are plans to use it to predict crimes, lend money, track people on the country's ubiquitous closed-circuit cameras, alleviate traffic jams, create self-guided missiles and censor the internet.
Beijing is backing its artificial intelligence push with vast sums of money. Having already spent billions on research programs, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China's A.I. capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan.
China's private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu -- often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition -- this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots.
China is spending more just as the United States cuts back. This past week, the Trump administration released a proposed budget that would slash funding for a variety of government agencies that have traditionally backed artificial intelligence research.
""It's a race in the new generation of computing,"" said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The difference is that China seems to think it's a race and America doesn't.""
For Mr. Schwertfeger, the money mattered. He received a grant six times larger than what he might have gotten in Europe or America. That enabled him to set up a full artificial intelligence lab, with an assistant, a technician and a group of Ph.D. students.
""It's almost impossible for assistant professors to get this much money,"" he said. ""The research funding is shrinking in the U.S. and Europe. But it is definitely expanding in China.""
Mr. Schwertfeger's lab, which is part of ShanghaiTech University, works on ways for machines, without any aid from humans, to avoid obstacles. Decked out with wheeled robots, drones and sensors, the lab works on ways for computers to make their own maps and to improve the performance of robots with tasks like finding objects -- specifically, people -- during search-and-rescue operations.
Much of China's artificial intelligence push is similarly peaceful. Still, its prowess and dedication have set off alarms within the United States' defense establishment. The Defense Department found that Chinese money has been pouring into American artificial intelligence companies -- some of the same ones it had been looking to for future weapons systems.
Quantifying China's spending push is difficult, because authorities there disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the relatively unknown city of Xiangtan, in China's Hunan province, has pledged $2 billion toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the A.I. industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about $800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering $1 million to support any A.I. project established there.
On a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labor strikes based on possible precursors like labor strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software can be simplified so that it can be more easily integrated with cameras across the country.
China is preparing a concerted nationwide push, according to the two professors who advised on the effort but declined to be identified, because the effort has not yet been made public. While the size wasn't clear, they said, it would most likely result in billions of dollars in spending.
President Trump's proposed budget, meanwhile, would reduce the National Science Foundation's spending on so-called intelligent systems by 10 percent, to about $175 million. Research and development in other areas would also be cut, though the proposed budget does call for more spending on defense research and some supercomputing. The cuts would essentially shift more research and development to private American companies like Google and Facebook.
""The previous administration was preparing for a future with artificial intelligence,"" said Subbarao Kambhampati, president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial intelligence . "" They were talking about increasing basic research for artificial intelligence. Instead of increases, we are now being significantly affected.""
China's money won't necessarily translate into dominance. The government's top-down approach, closed-mouth bureaucracy and hoarding of information can hobble research. It threw a tremendous amount of resources toward curing severe acute respiratory syndrome, the deadly virus known as SARS, when it swept through the country 15 years ago. Yet the virus was eventually sequenced and tamed by a small Canadian lab, said Clay Shirky, a professor at N.Y.U. Shanghai and a technology writer.
""It wasn't that anyone was trying to stop the development of a SARS vaccine,"" Mr. Shirky said. ""It's the habit that yes is more risky than no.""
Authorities in China are now bringing top-down attention to fixing the problem of too much top-down control. While that may not sound promising, Wang Shengjin, a professor of electronic engineering at China's Tsinghua University, said he had noticed some improvement, such as professional groups sharing information, and authorities who are rolling back limits on professors claiming ownership of their discoveries for commercial purposes.
""The lack of open sources and sharing of information, this has been the reality,"" Mr. Wang said. ""But it has started to change.""
At the moment, cooperation and exchanges in artificial intelligence between the United States and China are largely open, at least from the American side. Chinese and American scholars widely publish their findings in journals accessible to all, and researchers from China are major players in America's research institutions.
Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent and Didi Chuxing have opened artificial intelligence labs in America, as have some Chinese start-ups. Over the past six years, Chinese investors helped finance 51 American artificial intelligence companies, contributing to the $700 million raised, according to the recent Pentagon report.
It's unclear how long the cooperation will continue. The Pentagon report urged more controls. And while there are government and private pushes out of China, it is difficult to tell which is which, as Baidu shows.
Baidu is a leader in China's artificial intelligence efforts. It is working on driverless cars. It has turned an app that started as a visual dictionary -- take a picture of an object, and your cellphone will tell you what it is -- into a site that uses facial recognition to find missing people, a major problem in a country where child kidnapping has been persistent. In one stunning example, it helped a family find a child kidnapped 27 years earlier. DNA testing confirmed the family connection.
Baidu's speech-recognition software -- which can accomplish the difficult task of hearing tonal differences in Chinese dialects -- is considered top of the class. When Microsoft announced last October that its speech recognition software had surpassed human-level language recognition, Baidu's head of research at the time playfully reminded the American company that his team had accomplished a similar feat a year earlier.
We had surpassed human-level Chinese recognition in 2015; happy to see Microsoft also get there for English less than a year later. -- Andrew Ng (@AndrewYNg) October 20, 2016
In an apparent effort to harness Baidu's breakthroughs, China said this year that it would open a lab that would cooperate with the company on A.I. research. The facility will be headed by two professors with long experience working for government programs designed to catch up to and replace foreign technology. Both professors also worked on a program called the Tsinghua Mobile Robot, according to multiple academic papers published on the topic. Research behind the robot, which in one award is described as a ""military-use intelligent ground robot,"" was sponsored by funding to improve Chinese military capabilities.
Li Wei, a professor involved in the Baidu cooperative effort, spent much of his career at Beihang University, one of China's seven schools of national defense.
A company spokeswoman said: ""Baidu develops products and services that improve people's lives. Through its partnership with the A.I. research community, Baidu aims to make a complicated world simpler through technology.""
Still, there are advantages in China's developing cutting-edge A.I. on its own. National efforts are aided by access to enormous amounts of data held by Chinese companies and universities, the large number of Chinese engineers being trained on either side of the Pacific and from government backing, said Mr. Wang, of Tsinghua.
Driving that attention is a breakthrough from an American company largely banned in China: Google. In March 2016, a Google artificial intelligence system, AlphaGo, beat a South Korean player at the complicated strategy game Go, which originated in China. This past week, AlphaGo beat the best player in the world, a Chinese national, at a tournament in Wuzhen, China.
The Google event changed the tenor of government discussions about funding, according to several Chinese professors.
""After AlphaGo came out and had such a big impact on the industry,"" said Zha Hongbin, a professor of machine learning at Peking University, ""the content of government discussions got much wider and more concrete."" Shortly afterward, the government created a new project on brain-inspired computing, he added.
For all the government support, advances in the field could ultimately backfire, Mr. Shirky said. Artificial intelligence may help China better censor the internet, a task that often blocks Chinese researchers from finding vital information. At the same time, better A.I. could make it easier for Chinese readers to translate articles and other information.
""The fact is,"" Mr. Shirky said, ""unlike automobile engineering, artificial intelligence will lead to surprises. That will make the world considerably less predictable, and that's never been Beijing's favorite characteristic.""

"To Grow Stronger, China Has to Grow More Slowly","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1955115258?accountid=14586,"When President Xi Jinping of China took power in 2012, digital cash hardly existed. Last year, the Chinese made $9 trillion in mobile payments, 80 times more than Americans. Chinese consumers pay for 25 percent of their purchases with digital cash delivered by a mobile phone app, and about one in seven carry no paper currency. In big cities like Shanghai, itâs hard to use paper to pay taxi fares or restaurant bills.
The rapid rise of a cashless society is a vivid example of how China broke out as a tech superpower in Mr. Xiâs first term. Left largely unregulated and free to innovate â on condition that they cooperate with government censors â the New Chinaâs private-sector tech giants have made stunning advances.
The mobile-payment systems were designed and built entirely by private Chinese companies. Already the worldâs largest market for e-commerce, solar energy and electric cars, China is also third-largest for venture capital and the fastest-growing for robots. An article in the M.I.T. Technology Review said the future of artificial intelligence is taking shape in China and urges the West to copy rather than fear this ârevolution.â China generates more patents than any other emerging nation and is on track to surpass the United States in spending on research and development next year.
Now that the 2017 Communist Party Congress has confirmed Mr. Xiâs complete hold on power for five more years, the question is how will he use this clout in pursuit of Chinaâs ultimate goal: to catch up with the United States as the worldâs leading economic superpower.
The answer depends on whether Mr. Xi recognizes that to continue growing stronger, China will have to grow more slowly. In its rush to catch the United States, China has been prioritizing growth that is wildly ambitious for a maturing, middle-income country. To hit its growth target, Beijing has been pumping record amounts of debt into the state-owned industries of Old China. Those debts now represent the biggest threat to the New China and Mr. Xiâs superpower ambitions.
The state-run economy of Old China still accounts for a sizable share of economic output, roughly 30 percent. Since 2008 more and more of the loans intended to prop up Old China have been going to risky investments like stocks and real estate and wasteful public construction projects. While it took one dollar of debt to fuel a dollar of growth before 2008, lately it has taken four dollars of debt.
Much has been said about all the money the United States, Europe and Japan have printed to stimulate the post-crisis recovery, but China has printed more than twice as much as those three combined, expanding its money supply by $16 trillion. A lot of this money has been diverted from industry into stock and real estate bubbles, rattling Chinese investors. By 2015 Chinese investors were sending billions of dollarsâ worth of renminbi abroad every month. To prevent a capital flight crisis, Beijing had to slap on new controls.
There is now a great pool of money trapped in China, itching to escape. Foreigners donât have faith in a currency they canât move freely, any more than locals do, and today the renminbi accounts for less than 1 percent of the worldâs foreign-exchange reserves, compared with over 60 percent for the United States dollar. Beijing had hoped to establish the renminbi as a reserve currency and make China a financial superpower, but it has made no progress.
To create trust in its currency and financial system, China has to quit pumping out debt to hit its unrealistic annual growth target of 6.5 percent. That target reflects the pace required to meet a goal set at the 2012 Party Congress, which was to double the size of the economy by 2020. Every time growth slips below 6.5 percent, the authorities roll out more debt, fearful that slower growth will undermine their geopolitical goals. Continuing on this path, China may double G.D.P. by 2020, but debt (excluding the financial sector) will rise from a precarious 235 percent of G.D.P. today to a potentially destabilizing 280 percent.
The most important step Mr. Xi could take is to scrap the habit of setting growth targets. To stabilize debt at the current level, China would need to accept growth of no more than 5 percent â about the pace of previous âmiracleâ economies like Japan and South Korea at a similar stage of development. To aim higher is to push China toward a debt crisis that could derail growth for years.
China has been able to keep the debt flowing longer than many people expected because in many cases the state owns both lender and borrower, and can keep shifting the debt from one hand to the other, like a three-card-monte player. Optimists think Beijing can play this game indefinitely, because the debt is domestically held, but eventually the banks will run short of money, in the form of deposits.
For the first time in Chinaâs modern history, total loans in the banking system now exceed deposits and are growing at a rate that will probably push loans to above 120 percent of deposits by 2020. At that point in a debt binge, history shows, a financial crisis of some kind usually breaks out, even in countries like China, where the debt is funded internally and not by foreigners.
Any crisis in Old China is likely to spill over into the vibrant private sectors, which are relatively debt-free. The private sector now accounts for 70 percent of economic output but only 30 percent of corporate debt. The only way to prevent a ripple-effect crisis in the New China is to slow the flow of debt, which means dropping growth targets grounded in political ambition rather than economic logic.
Mr. Xi seems to understand the perils of debt, which has undermined many past empires, including dynasties in China. He recently questioned the official obsession with G.D.P. growth â saying development is ânot a numbers gameâ and that most Chinese care more about quality-of-life issues like pollution. Significantly, in his speech last week at the Party Congress, Mr. Xi did not refer to the 2020 growth target, implying flexibility on the need to achieve it.
But until Mr. Xi outright scraps the growth target, all the players in the Old China are going to put a priority on hitting it, no matter how much debt it takes. Fitful government attempts to tighten credit regulations have merely shifted the flow of debt to new targets, most recently mortgage loans. The International Monetary Fund argues that China is much more likely to âbecome a rich country in the long runâ if it puts more emphasis on slower debt growth and less on hitting high growth targets.
If Chinaâs economy is allowed to slow further â as previous miracle economies did at a similar stage of development â it will take longer for the economy to match the size of the United States economy, certainly much longer than Chinaâs leaders had hoped. Better, though, to be remembered for putting China on the long path to real superpower status than the shorter path to crisis.

The Quiet Rivalry Between China and Russia,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1959307740?accountid=14586,"Chinaâs âOne Belt, One Roadâ initiative, an economic expansion plan that follows the trade routes of the medieval Tang and Yuan dynasties across Eurasia, is overly ambitious because, like all grand strategies, it is aspirational. Yet the future of Eurasia is written into its design.
This new Silk Road serves several goals of Chinaâs leaders, who are intent on making their country a full-fledged superpower. It is a branding operation for many of the roads, bridges, pipelines and railroads that China has already built, linking it with the former-Soviet-controlled countries of energy-rich Central Asia. In the process, One Belt, One Road seeks to develop â and at the same time surround â the Muslim region of China that abuts Central Asia.
Further westward, China intends to create an organic alliance with Iran, a state that because of its immense size, location and population, as well as its long imperial tradition, functions as the fulcrum for the Middle East and Central Asia.
The larger Chinese goal is to dominate Eurasia, which means relegating Russia to a second-tier power.
China and Russia share a land border of more than 2,600 miles, an interminable stretch of birch forest separating mainly the Russian Far East from Chinese Manchuria, whose particulars were formally agreed upon only in the last decade. In 1969, the dispatch of about 30 Soviet divisions to this border, and Chinaâs deployment of 59 divisions in response, deepened the Chinese-Soviet split and allowed for President Richard Nixonâs opening to China and his dÃ©tente with the Soviet Union.
In few areas is the Russian state so feeble as in its far east. The ethnic Russian population is only an estimated 6 million. Chinese migrants are moving steadily north into this vastly underpopulated Siberian back-of-beyond, rich in the natural gas, oil, timber, diamonds and gold that China covets. China lost part of this region to Russia only in the 19th century, when the Qing dynasty was in its death throes, and the rest in the 20th century.
At the same time, China is vanquishing Russia in Central Asia. In the last decade, the China National Petroleum Corporation has become Central Asiaâs main energy player. China pumps Kazakh oil to Europe and also to China through a pipeline, and the Chinese transport natural gas from Turkmenistan to western China. Chinese money has also been coursing through Central Asia to build power grids and transportation infrastructure, altering the landscape and forming the backbone of the One Belt, One Road plan.
The prize is Iran. Lying at the other end of Central Asia from China, Iran has 80 million people and straddles the oil and gas fields of the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, providing Beijing with the incentive to build rail lines through the Iranian plateau, make energy deals with Tehran, use Chinese state companies to excavate Iranian mines, and send armies of entrepreneurs there. Russiaâs Eurasian Economic Union, including Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, was formed in 2014 to counter Chinaâs growing influence in Eurasia.
Russia is not only losing out to China in its far east and Central Asia, but in Europe, too. While Moscow has been undermining the independence of the former Soviet republics in the Baltic and Black Sea basins through subversion and military incursions, Beijing has been strengthening trade ties throughout Europe. The Trump administrationâs aversion to free trade â combined with its apparent ambivalence about defending European allies â has provided China with an opportunity in Europe, further enhancing Beijingâs plans for the western terminus of One Belt, One Road. Chinaâs gains will weaken not only American influence in Europe, but Russian influence, too.
For example, Greece, because of its tensions with the European Union and its Orthodox religion, should be drifting closer to Russia. But it is slipping into Chinaâs economic grasp, as the port of Piraeus becomes another western endpoint of the new Silk Road. China is also competing for nuclear power plants and other energy infrastructure in Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and the Czech Republic. President Vladimir Putinâs compulsion to challenge the West â while China under President Xi Jinping is quietly on the march all around him â demonstrates his strategic shortsightedness at a time of Russian economic vulnerability.
China and Russia refer to their relationship as a âcomprehensive strategic partnership,â in which Russia supplies oil to China and the two countries hold joint military exercises. And, officially, their relationship has rarely been better.
But trade is lopsided in Chinaâs favor; the fall in energy prices has made China considerably less dependent on Russia. Russia sells arms to Chinaâs adversaries, India and Vietnam. And China has copied Russian weapons designs.
These deeper geopolitical realities mean China and Russia will be only allies of convenience. And because the Beijing-Moscow rivalry is long-term, understated and focused on remote terrain, thus lacking in appeal for the news media, it is easy to ignore.
Chinaâs geopolitical ambitions, like Russiaâs, arise out of internal insecurity. The Chinese state is weakest in the west â that is, in historic East Turkestan â home to the Muslim Turkic Uighur minority, which the dominant ethnic group, the Han Chinese, view with trepidation.
Islam represents an alternative identity for the Uighurs, one independent of the Chinese state. Unlike the Tibetans with their Dalai Lama, the Uighurs donât have an elite leadership with which to communicate with Beijing. Rather, they embody an anarchic force that could be provoked into upheaval by an environmental disaster or other emergency. Chinaâs One Belt, One Road initiative, by joining the rest of Turkic Central Asia economically and politically closer to China, is meant in part to deny the Uighurs a rear base in an uprising.
China can be stopped only by its own internal demons. As Samuel P. Huntington wrote in his classic 1968 study, âPolitical Order in Changing Societies,â the more complex a society gets, the more responsive its institutions must become, otherwise the creation of a large middle class is destabilizing.
Chinaâs autocracy, precisely because of its successes, could face a crisis of legitimacy as social, ethnic and religious tensions intensify in both Han and Uighur areas, especially in the event of any further slowdowns in economic growth that thwart the rising expectations of its people. Thatâs why the ultimate success of One Belt, One Road will be determined less by what happens in Central Asia and elsewhere than by what happens inside China itself.
The United States, which has longtime allies to defend against Chinese bullying in East Asia and against Russian bullying in Central and Eastern Europe, is helped by the quiet geopolitical rivalry between Beijing and Moscow. Because the contest between China and Russia is largely determined by their geographical proximity and therefore must persist, America will have the greater possibility to maneuver, hardening or softening its position toward each power as the situation demands.
The United States must only prevent China from dominating the Eastern Hemisphere to the same extent that it has dominated the Western Hemisphere. But it must do this without selling out Central Europe and parts of the Middle East to Russia.
The solution to this conundrum for the United States lies outside geopolitics. It is precisely because Washington has no territorial ambitions in Eurasia that Americans are not viewed with suspicion by local populations there the way the Chinese and Russians are. By relentlessly promoting free trade, human rights and civil society America will gain credibility with societies undergoing rapid social transformation across the region.
This is how the United States gains entry into Eurasia without crudely trying to balance one power off against the other at a moment when the Chinese-Russian rivalry is far more subtle than it was in Nixonâs time. The very economic development that China promotes will make societies along the path of the new Silk Road â particularly in the sterile dictatorships of Iran and Central Asia â harder to manage, and thus to rule.
It is precisely the universal values that President Trump disdains that can now pay geopolitical dividends. A populist-nationalist agenda that confines American interests to North America will only marginalize the United States on the other side of the world.

A Deal-Maker Goes to China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1960561293?accountid=14586,"With few successes under his belt on the domestic front, President Trump has gone to Asia this week hungry to negotiate deals. In Beijing, he will meet his match in President Xi Jinping, another bold and pugnacious nationalist who emerged last month from a Communist Party Congress with more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.
Chinese-American relations are increasingly fraught, and with so much power concentrated in Mr. Xiâs hands, the only way to forge a better relationship is through a personal connection at the top, which makes the summit meeting later this week so important.
Mr. Xi will not be easily pressured into compromise on Mr. Trumpâs terms on any of the pressing bilateral issues like North Korea and trade. And Mr. Trump, who has bluntly criticized China and has also praised Mr. Xi, has not yet shown the kind of long-term strategic thinking that this relationship demands. Thus, a grand agreement on this trip is unlikely. But Mr. Trump could save the meeting by agreeing with Mr. Xi to establish a formal way to work on Chinese-American relations over time.
There are many obstacles to building stronger ties. An increasingly expansionist Beijing has declared the South China Sea a sovereign âcore interestâ and has clashed with Tokyo over an island in the East China Sea. The Chinese leadership has quashed hopes for democratic governance in Hong Kong, a self-governing Chinese territory, and bullied South Korea for hosting a missile-defense system supplied by the United States. China defends protectionist trade and investment policies that are unfair to American businesses.
On the American side, Mr. Trump has added to tensions by bluntly criticizing China for its trade practices and for failing to rein in Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. He has tweeted that China under Mr. Xi is âtaking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S.â
But Mr. Trump has also shown characteristic inconsistency about China by praising Mr. Xi, calling him âa powerful manâ and âa very good person,â adding admiringly that some now even think of him as âthe king of China.â This unpredictability could play to Mr. Trumpâs advantage, allowing him to remain a mysterious negotiator: The Chinese could rightly assume anything might be on the table this week.
The North Korean nuclear threat is at the top of the agenda. Beijing has come a long way in recent years in recognizing the danger from Pyongyang, even supporting progressively tougher sanctions at the United Nations. But Mr. Xi still resists totally abandoning this old âfraternalâ ally â once said to be as âclose as lips and teeth.â
Private talks between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump could clarify what Beijing would expect if the North Korean regime were to collapse. Beijing would argue for the removal of the United States missile-defense system in South Korea, for a ban on American troops north of the demilitarized zone and ultimately a possible withdrawal of United States forces from South Korea.
When it comes to trade and investment, the two countries also have common interests that urgently need readjusting. American patronage has afforded China many special dispensations that have helped its economy boom over the past three decades. But now that China has had such success, itâs time to level the playing field.
Mr. Trump should press China to end practices like requiring that proprietary American technology be transferred to Chinese companies as a condition of doing business in the country, rampant theft of intellectual property and the refusal to let American companies into major sectors of the Chinese economy (like telecommunications, media and banking). Beijing must take action on these fronts to build trust with Washington and establish a more reciprocal relationship.
At the very least, whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi make progress on North Korea or these economic issues, the two leaders should agree to form a high-level working group, led on each side by someone trusted by each president, to take a defined time period of several months to agree on a specific âroad mapâ of possibilities for more collaboration.
At the end of the groupâs allotted time, the two presidents could meet at a relaxed venue to adopt the groupâs recommendations. Such a forward-looking plan would make the summit meeting a success.
If a working group convened and eventually failed, the United States would at least know that closer cooperation in the Xi-Trump era was unlikely. This would position Washington to take a harder line against Beijing and justify moves like increased freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea; more military support for South Korea, Japan and Taiwan; building closer military alliances with countries like Vietnam, Singapore, Australia and India; and putting greater controls on Chinese investments in the United States.
Mr. Trump, with his penchant for deal-making and his relatively weak political position, may be tempted to accept whatever he can get in Beijing for the sake of appearances. He could easily end up becoming a mere prop used to enhance Mr. Xiâs stature, and getting little in return.
But Mr. Trump must remember that just as Beijing has nonnegotiable âcore interests,â so does the United States. It would be fatal to trade any of them â commitments to allies, freedom of navigation through international waters, democratic principles â even for promises of cooperation on North Korea.

"Once Formidable, Taiwanâs Military Now Overshadowed by Chinaâs","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1960561462?accountid=14586,"ZUOYING NAVAL BASE, Taiwan â The Hai Pao, one of Taiwanâs four navy submarines, began its service as the Tusk, an American vessel launched in August 1945 at the end of World War II. Its sister submarine, the Hai Shih, is a year older. Neither can fire torpedoes today, though they can still lay mines.
The submarines, said Feng Shih-kuan, Taiwanâs minister of national defense, âbelong in a museum.â
The Hai Pao â with its paint-encrusted pipes, antiquated engines and a brass dial with a needle to measure speed in knots â will instead remain in service past its 80th birthday, a relic of a military that once was one of Asiaâs most formidable. Taiwanâs aging submarine fleet is but one measure of how far the military balance across the Taiwan Strait has tilted in favor of the islandâs rival, mainland China.
A military modernization overseen by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whose political power reached new heights after last monthâs Communist Party congress in Beijing, has proceeded in leaps and bounds, lifted by hefty budget increases that have already made China the worldâs No. 2 military spender after the United States, though it is a distant second.
Taiwanâs armed forces, by contrast, have fallen way behind, struggling to recruit enough soldiers and sailors â and to equip those they have. A major obstacle is that countries that might sell it the most sophisticated weaponry are increasingly reluctant to do so for fear of provoking China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory. The unwillingness to anger China extends even to the United States, on which Taiwan has long depended for its defense.
This shifting balance affects more than just Taiwan. The Taiwan Strait was once Asiaâs most ominous flash point, with the potential to drag the United States into war with China. Now, it is just one of several potential hot spots between a more assertive China and its neighbors.
Taiwanâs experience could be a cautionary tale to Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and others in the region who are also warily watching Chinaâs rising military capabilities.
âA small snake does not make nearby frogs, chickens and ducks feel threatened,â Mr. Feng, the minister, said in an interview, âbut when it grows to be a python, even nearby pigs, oxen, horses and goats feel a threat to their survival.â
Adding to the unease has been uncertainty over United States policy under President Trump. As he makes his first visit to Asia, allies and others will look for signals about the depth of the American military commitment to the region.
When he was still president-elect, Mr. Trump initially signaled a more fulsome embrace of Taiwan by accepting a congratulatory phone call from its president, Tsai Ing-wen. Since taking office, he has shown more deference to China in hopes of winning its support in the nuclear standoff with North Korea.
When the Trump administration approved a new package of arms sales to Taiwan this summer, it was worth a relatively modest $1.4 billion, less than the $1.8 billion package approved by President Barack Obama two years ago. The sales have included missiles, radar equipment and other military gear, but they stopped short of the major systems that could give Taiwan a real edge.
Any weakening of the American defense commitment âis what Taiwan worries about most,â said Lu Cheng-fu, an assistant professor at National Quemoy University on Kinmen, an island held by Taiwan that sits just four miles from the Chinese coast.
âWe need to resist a Chinese military attack for two weeks and wait for help from the United States or the international community,â said Mr. Lu, echoing a strategy that has been at the core of Taiwanâs defense doctrine for decades.
China has made no secret of its desire to absorb Taiwan, and Chinaâs military routinely drills to do so by force, if necessary. It has even built a scale replica of Taiwanâs presidential building at its largest military training base in Inner Mongolia.
Chinaâs armed forces have long outnumbered and outspent Taiwanâs. China now has 800,000 active combat troops in its ground forces, compared with 130,000 in Taiwan; its budget last year was $144 billion, compared with Taiwanâs $10 billion, according to the Pentagonâs most recent annual report on the Chinese military. (Congress approved a $700 billion Pentagon budget in September, with an even larger increase than President Trump had requested.)
To defend itself, Taiwan has relied on geography â a mountainous main island 80 miles across a windswept strait â and the support of the United States.
However, Chinaâs military modernization has âeroded or negated many of Taiwanâs historical advantagesâ in deterring a potential attack, the Pentagon report warned in May.
The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 commits the United States to defend the islandâs sovereignty, providing âsuch defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessaryâ for Taiwan to protect itself.
While Taiwan still has vocal support in Washington, especially in Congress, Chinaâs economic and military rise has made it harder for the United States to ignore Beijing.
In 1995 and 1996, when China menaced Taiwan with missile tests, President Bill Clinton dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait. At that time, China backed off, but an intervention now would confront a more potent Chinese military.
China has developed ballistic missiles on mobile launchers that, although untested in battle, would threaten American aircraft carriers. Denying the American military the ability to operate freely around Taiwan would undermine a core element of Taiwanâs strategy.
In Taiwan, once home to thousands of American air and naval forces before the United States recognized the Peopleâs Republic of China in 1979, Mr. Trumpâs election last year raised hopes of more robust support.
In the months since, however, there has been a growing realization that diplomacy with China â including Mr. Trumpâs very public efforts to build a personal relationship with Mr. Xi â would be the administrationâs more pressing priority.
Though the arms package announced in the summer was welcomed, it was not nearly enough to help Taiwan keep pace with Chinaâs buildup. More ambitious packages â like one announced by President George W. Bush in 2001 to sell Taiwan eight new diesel-powered submarines that ultimately fizzled out â no longer seem affordable or, for the United States, viable if it wants to maintain relations with Beijing.
âTaiwan needs to realize that its defense is, ultimately, in its own hands,â said Andrew S. Erickson, a professor with the China Maritime Studies Institute at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.
During a recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. Tsai responded to concerns about the imbalance by pledging to increase military spending 2 percent a year. She also promised to make more funds available for purchases of larger weapons.
Since being elected in January 2016, Ms. Tsai has also promoted a plan to expand the islandâs indigenous defense industry. Among the most ambitious of the projects envisioned is one to build its own fleet of diesel-powered submarines.
In choosing a defense minister, she turned to Mr. Feng, an air force general who spent 39 years in uniform before retiring in 2006 to become chairman of Taiwanâs largest defense company. In January, he announced that Taiwan would seek to develop its own stealth fighters to counter Chinaâs introduction of stealth jets.
Until such programs are off the ground, Taiwan must rely on aging matÃ©riel.
Its two other submarines were built by the Netherlands in the 1980s. By contrast, China, according to the Pentagon report, has 59 attack submarines, including five that are nuclear-powered.
âRegardless of whether you are talking about the quantity or the quality of our submarines,â the Hai Paoâs captain, Wang Kuo-min, said onboard, âthere is a very big gap between us and the Chinese Communist contingent.â
Some experts say that given Chinaâs overwhelming numerical advantage in weaponry, Taiwan should focus less on big platforms like submarines and more on lower-cost weapons like antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles that can blunt Chinaâs superiority.
âTaiwan needs to invest in things that give us new and asymmetric capabilities and can be operational in three to five years,â said Yu Hsiao-pin, who has served on Taiwanâs National Security Council.
In the meantime, China keeps ratcheting up the pressure. Its aircraft routinely probe Taiwanâs airspace, forcing Taiwanâs fighters to respond on at least eight occasions so far this year. In July, Chinaâs first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, traversed the Taiwan Strait in a show of force.
âWe cannot allow the situation to become routine,â said Col. Hsieh Chu-yuan, political warfare director of the 455th Tactical Fighter Wing, whose F-16s scramble from the islandâs main air force base at Chiayi.
The F-16s, bought from the United States in 1992, now face off against increasingly sophisticated Chinese jets, including, soon, the Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter. Taiwan has no choice but to use the weaponry that it has to deter China, said Mr. Feng, the defense minister.
âTaiwan canât match China jet for jet, boat for boat,â he said, but that hardly leaves it defenseless.
âAny attempts to harm Taiwanâs people or invade its territory,â he said, âwill come at a great cost.â

Chinaâs Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1961520454?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â When President Trump arrives in Beijing on Wednesday, he will most likely complain about traditional areas of dispute like steel and cars. But Washington officials and major global companies increasingly worry about a new generation of deals that could give China a firmer grip on the technology of tomorrow.
Under an ambitious plan unveiled two years ago called Made in China 2025, Beijing has designs to dominate cutting-edge technologies like advanced microchips, artificial intelligence and electric cars, among many others, in a decade. And China is enlisting some of the worldâs biggest technology players in its push.
Sometimes it demands partnerships or intellectual property as the price of admission to the worldâs second-largest economy. Sometimes it woos foreign giants with money and market access in ways that elude American and global trade rules.
When concerned officials in Washington began blocking Chinaâs ability to buy high-end technology last year, one American company found a way to help its Chinese partner around those limits. The company, Advanced Micro Devices, avoided scrutiny by licensing its exclusive microchip designs, rather than selling them.
The Chinese partner got access to the technology to make its own products. Advanced Micro Devices got a big payout.
The rules of global commerce are changing â and China and the United States are racing to create a future that aligns with their own distinct visions. The result could be an overhaul of 20th-century trade rules for a 21st-century global economic order, in which money, ideas and influence could become as closely watched and tightly regulated as hard goods packed on a ship and sent abroad.
Even before the Communist Revolution, China obsessed about absorbing foreign technology as a way to end a century of humiliation and restore its national strength. But Made in China 2025 is more ambitious than anything the government has ever attempted, a national industrial policy that aims to project a new type of global might and influence.
China is directing billions of dollars to invest in research at home as well as to acquire innovative technology from abroad. A Beijing-directed semiconductor fund is thought to have more than $100 billion at its disposal, while another plan aims to grow Chinaâs artificial intelligence companies into a $150 billion industry by 2030.
Such efforts have some American government officials and business leaders calling for a rethinking of how the United States approaches trade. Lawmakers are pushing for tougher rules on technology purchases, which do not usually cover the types of deals that China increasingly prefers. Officials are also investigating whether China is stealing intellectual property.
âThere are a few U.S. companies that have been leaning too far about sharing technology with countries that are potential enemies of ours,â said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the United States secretary of commerce, in September remarks regarding information technology that were widely seen as referring to China.
âI donât think thatâs a very good idea. I think itâs the ultimate short-termism to give up very valuable I.T. in order to get a few quarters or a few years of improved sales.â
Robots and Rice Cookers
China looks to the West for much of its technology. Even some of its most sensitive systems that run government computers, banks and laboratories use chips from Intel and Qualcomm and software from Microsoft or Oracle, a dependence it sees as a long-term vulnerability.
The government hopes to change that. It is backing the effort with money: $45 billion in cheap loans for its companies, $3 billion for advanced manufacturing efforts and billions more in other financial support, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank.
Made in China 2025 âis going to have substantial resources and focus devoted to it, especially at the local government level,â said Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing.
The goal is not simply to beat the United States. China is preparing for a day when cheap manufacturing no longer keeps its economy humming. It wants to embrace industries offering skilled jobs that do not blacken its skies and cloud its rivers.
The plan itself has specific targets and quotas. By 2025 it envisions China meeting nearly three-quarters of its own demand for industrial robots and more than a third of its demand for smartphone chips. Other targets cover new-energy cars, like electric cars, and high-performance medical devices.
The template for Made in China 2025 was cribbed from a German government plan called Industrie 4.0, which calls for greater automation and the growing use of âsmart factoriesâ doing sophisticated work with fewer people. And the deal that woke up the world to Chinaâs plan was a German one.
Last year, a Chinese appliance maker called Midea struck a surprise $3.9 billion deal to acquire Kuka, an advanced robotics company in Germany. The deal made Midea â best known for its refrigerators and rice cookers â a major player in automation.
âOur partnership with Kuka is actually about whole factory solutions,â said Irene Chen, a spokeswoman for Midea.
Where technology cannot be purchased, the government wants Chinese companies to extract it from foreign firms through deals or tough new laws.
China will soon require foreign auto companies to make electric cars there if they want to continue selling gasoline-powered vehicles in what is now the worldâs largest car market. General Motors, Volkswagen and others have been scrambling to form joint ventures with Chinese partners to do so.
Cybersecurity laws enacted this summer give the Ministry of State Security the power to conduct security reviews of technology sold or used in China, said James A. Lewis, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Such a step could require companies to expose some of their most valuable secrets.
At some companies, Chinese security officials conduct the inspections in corporate âclean roomsâ in the United States, with the Chinese officials traveling on business visas, Mr. Lewis said. The companies argue that the access takes place under controlled circumstances that limit what Chinese officials might learn.
âIf American companies have a big market in China, they say to the Ministry of State Security, âCome in,ââ Mr. Lewis said. âEveryone fears retaliation. No one wants to lose the China market.â
Old Rules, New Products
Wary of the push, the United States has used existing rules to stop Chinese purchases of foreign businesses in areas important to national security.
But many of those tools do not apply to todayâs deals, as A.M.D.âs Chinese pact shows.
A.M.D.âs joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.
The park represents Beijingâs vision of the future. Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes. Offices of Chinaâs most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.
Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D. works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.
Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D. agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers. Because A.M.D. controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.
But A.M.D. struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls. That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers. The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.
Experts say the dual partnerships could help China develop a new generation of powerful supercomputers. China already makes the worldâs fastest computers, but they run on homegrown chips that cannot read commonly available software for supercomputers. With A.M.D.âs help, experts say, Sugon could develop chips that could make Chinaâs supercomputers more versatile and adaptable and replace those from foreign firms.
âWe have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export,â an A.M.D. spokesman said in an emailed statement. He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D. sells in America.
Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.âs control was not involved in chip development.
Yet in an interview with the Chinese state news media, Zhang Yunquan, a top government researcher and head of the National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, China, said that Sugon could use the work of the joint venture to make supercomputer microchips. Such a supercomputer would be crucial in designing next-generation weapons systems, according to experts.
âWhen they first announced the partnership I was shocked,â said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst with Sanford Bernstein.
âYou would think intellectual property and joint ventures would belong under Cfius review,â Mr. Rasgon said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals. âIt should. Itâs surprising it isnât.â
New Rules for a New Era?
For some in the Trump administration, an 18-year-old book by two Chinese Air Force colonels has become required reading.
Called âUnrestricted Warfare,â the book argues that China does not need to match the United States militarily. Instead China can take advantage of the global economy and the internet to take down its main rival.
Some American officials see in it a guide to Chinaâs plan. Some United States lawmakers are proposing to toughen American takeover laws to evaluate deals on an economic as well as a national security basis. They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures. The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.
âThereâs concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages,â said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.
Such changes could ripple through the tech world. Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached. Some tech companies say that is good for innovation. Chinaâs spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.
Still, many American companies fear the deck is stacked against them. The United States long believed bringing China into the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trade disputes, would ensure it would follow the rules. But the W.T.O. has proved ineffective when it comes to tech issues.
At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public. Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firmâs business.
The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.
âMade in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China,â said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
âIf Made in China 2025 achieves its goals,â he said, âthe U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China â selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.â

"Vietnam, in a Bind, Tries to Chart a Path Between U.S. and China","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1962784481?accountid=14586,"HANOI, Vietnam â Vietnamâs full-on war with the United States lasted a decade. Its tensions with its northern neighbor, China, have persisted for thousands of years â from a millennium of direct Chinese rule and a bloody border war in 1979 to more recent confrontations in the South China Sea.
If geography is destiny, then the fate of Vietnam is to be an expert in bargaining with Beijing and balancing between superpowers.
So with the rest of the world struggling to reckon with Chinaâs assertive moves in the Pacific, the Vietnamese, hosts of this yearâs Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, are offering guidance.
âI would like to give advice to the whole world, and especially to the United States, that you must be careful with China,â said Maj. Gen. Le Van Cuong, the retired director of the Institute of Strategic Studies at the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security.
Like any good Communist soldier, General Cuong pays attention to the details of leadersâ abstruse speeches, and he noted that President Xi Jinping of China had referred to his homelandâs status as a âgreatâ or âstrong powerâ 26 times in a lengthy address last month.
âXi Jinpingâs ambitions are dangerous for the whole world,â General Cuong said. âChina uses its money to buy off many leaders, but none of the countries that are its close allies, like North Korea, Pakistan or Cambodia, have done well. Countries that are close to America have done much better. We must ask: Why is this?â
As with other Southeast Asian nations acutely aware that they are positioned in Chinaâs backyard, Vietnam is worried about American inattention.
In the name of halting Communism, the United States once sent troops to Indochina and propped up dictators elsewhere in Asia. But the American-devised security landscape also created a stable environment in which regional economies expanded.
Now, Mr. Trumpâs decision to take the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which would have given 11 other economies an alternative to a Chinese-led economic order, has left the Vietnamese feeling vulnerable.
âAs Vietnamese, we are always trying to find a way to balance Chinaâs power,â said Nguyen Ngoc Anh, a professor at the Foreign Trade University in Hanoi. âFor us, TPP isnât just an economic issue. Itâs also about geopolitics and social issues.â
Ms. Anh noted that local liberals had cheered the trade pact because it would have forced Vietnam to adhere to international labor and government accountability standards that Hanoi might otherwise not meet.
With the 11 other members of the pact agreeing to proceed without the United States, Washingtonâs withdrawal â not to mention Mr. Trumpâs âAmerica Firstâ speech at the APEC meeting on Friday â leaves some nations wondering if their best option may be Chinese-backed trade pacts and financing deals that have fewer guarantees for workers and less official transparency.
âWe are both Communist countries, but people like me in Vietnam donât want to develop the same way that China has,â said Ms. Anh, who studied economics in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia. âWe want to follow the Western-oriented way.â
While the United States is the largest market for Vietnamese exports, Vietnamâs biggest trading partner is China. Yet Vietnam runs a significant trade deficit with its populous neighbor, and Vietnamese economists worry that China doesnât play fairly.
âChina is one of the few countries in the world that doesnât observe international law in many areas,â said Le Dang Doanh, an influential economist who has advised members of the Vietnamese Politburo on trade.
The Vietnamese watched in alarm last year when Beijing reacted to an international tribunalâs dismissal of Chinaâs expansive claims over the South China Sea by ignoring â and even mocking â the judgment. Vietnam and four other governments have claims of their own on the resource-rich waterway that conflict with Chinaâs.
It is hard to overstate the level of Vietnamese antipathy toward China. In a country where public protest is rare and risky, some of the few large-scale demonstrations in Vietnam in recent years have been against the Chinese.
But this national aversion puts Vietnamâs leadership in a bind. It cannot ignore Chinaâs growing economic magnetism. For many members of APEC, China now ranks as their No. 1 trading partner.
In return for investment and project financing â roads, railways, dams, airports and colossal government buildings â leaders of regional economies are increasingly doing Beijingâs bidding.
Cambodia and Laos have given crucial support for Beijingâs South China Sea claims. Thailand has complied with Beijingâs demand that it return Chinese dissidents who once counted on it as a haven.
Even the Philippines has appeared to yield, despite the fact it lodged the successful South China Sea suit at The Hague. Days before Mr. Trumpâs visit to Manila this Sunday, it disclosed that President Rodrigo Duterte had ordered construction halted on a disputed sandbar in the South China Sea, a move widely regarded as intended to placate Beijing.
Since taking office last year, Mr. Duterte has deemed the era of American military and economic pre-eminence over, and has called China his countryâs best and faithful friend. He has been rewarded with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment from Beijing.
âThe U.S. has been playing catch-up to Chinaâs charm offensive since the turn of the new century,â said Tang Siew Mun, who heads the Southeast Asia center at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore.
Vietnam, more than any other country, has grown practiced at divining when not to challenge the two Pacific powers â both of which it fought within the last half-century.
In the 1970s and 1980s, China seized spits of land in the South China Sea that Vietnam had controlled or that were unoccupied but claimed by Hanoi.
Yet perhaps sensing an American reluctance to confront China in the South China Sea, Vietnam has declined to take China to international court, as the Philippines did, even as the Chinese have turned disputed reefs and sandbars into militarized islands.
Chinese pressure continues, despite the United Statesâ supplying the Vietnamese Coast Guard with a cutter and new patrol boats.
This year, a Spanish company with prospecting rights from Vietnam suspended drilling in an oil block off the coast of Vietnam. Beijing claims part of the waters as its own.
In 2014, the Chinese parked a state-owned oil rig off Danang, where Mr. Trump attended the APEC summit meeting on Friday, in a forceful incursion into what Hanoi considers its territorial waters.
âLiving next to China, which has ambitions to become the most powerful country in the world, is not easy,â said Vo Van Tao, a popular political blogger. âTo lower the heat, Vietnam needs to withdraw from areas that belong to Vietnam.â
Grand strategy is beyond the worldview of Vietnamese like Do Van Duc. In 1979, he was stationed on the border with China, as part of an antiaircraft artillery unit, when hundreds of thousands of Peopleâs Liberation Army soldiers from China flooded south.
The Vietnamese, while outmanned, put up an unexpectedly robust defense. Within a month, the Chinese, professing that they had taught the Vietnamese a lesson for interfering in regional geopolitics, withdrew.
During the war with China, Mr. Duc was only 17 years old, but he came to understand one thing then that today, as a security guard living in Hanoi, he said he still clings to.
âWe cannot trust the Chinese,â he said. âThey are our ancient enemy, and that will not change.â

"In China, the Brutality of âHouse Arrestâ","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1968570530?accountid=14586,"Authoritarian regimes shroud their darkest features in euphemism. So it is with Chinaâs âresidential surveillance at a designated location.â It sounds like a kind of house arrest, a milder form of detention for those under investigation, perhaps, or awaiting trial. It is not.
It is in fact the codification in law of a widespread practice of whisking people into secret detention â âdisappearingâ them into a labyrinth where Chinaâs stunted legal protections can do little to prevent abuse. The practice violates not only human rights but also international law, according to Michael Caster of Safeguard Defenders, a group founded in August to protect those in Asia who fight for human rights, womenâs rights and civil society.
Article 73 of Chinaâs Criminal Procedure Law was amended in 2012 to allow the authorities to detain people for reasons of âstate securityâ or âterrorism.â Detainees can be held for as long as six months in âdesignated locationsâ â secret prisons.
China has shown that it can define those reasons so broadly that it sweeps up anyone viewed as a political threat to the supremacy of the Communist Party: dissidents, lawyers, activists and outspoken Tibetans and Uighurs. Among those who have been held under a form of âresidential surveillanceâ are the artist Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo, the poet and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died in the stateâs custody in July.
Mr. Casterâs group has compiled 12 accounts by those who have descended into this Orwellian legal abyss. They appear in a book, âThe Peopleâs Republic of the Disappeared,â that was published in English this month and is scheduled to come out in Chinese on Friday. These accounts â two of them anonymous, some written by those safely outside China, some by brave souls still inside â represent the experiences of hundreds, if not thousands, of people who have been deprived of the legal rights the countryâs Constitution ostensibly allows them.
The narrators tell of physical and psychological abuse, beatings and sleep deprivation, humiliations, isolation and threats to relatives. The nature of Article 73 fosters such abuse, its critics assert. In regular detention centers, institutional norms like the presence of guards and prosecutors can serve as a deterrent to violations. In the solitary confinement typical of âdesignated locations,â there are few constraints. It has become âa more severe, more terrible, coercive measure than normal criminal detention,â Teng Biao, a lawyer who left China after his own secret detentions, writes in the bookâs foreword.
China under Xi Jinping seems increasingly impervious to criticism. And the United States under President Trump no longer presses the issue of human rights. What follows are adapted excerpts, rare in their detail, from the accounts of three of those who remain in China and are taking a great risk to recount their experiences.
Tang Jitian
Mr. Tang, one of the countryâs most prominent defense lawyers, was arrested in 2011 for his work defending activists including Chen Guangcheng, the blind dissident who would later escape house arrest and hide in the United States Embassy in Beijing. He had just met with a group of lawyers when police officers pushed into his apartment. The officers covered his head with a black plastic shopping bag and drove him to what âlooked like a country resort,â though one without amenities. He was later moved again in similar fashion. Last weekend he was barred from crossing into Hong Kong for medical treatment.
The room was small. The two beds were pressed almost together. There was no toilet seat. I had to use a ladle to scoop water to clean the toilet after using it.
I was made to sit up straight, facing the wall in a tiny space. One bright light shone directly onto my face. Even though it was winter, the air-conditioner was blowing cold air. My captors wore big cotton padded coats. I had sweated a lot on the way there, crammed into the car between the guards, with my head in a plastic bag and wearing my thick jacket. My jacket was so wet with sweat I couldnât wear it anymore.
Four armed policemen and two younger guards took turns monitoring me. They made sure I knew who was in charge, saying: âOur soldiers take orders from the top. If you donât behave, we will break your kneecaps.â I wasnât allowed to sleep. I was cold and tired. It was hard to sit still. If I didnât sit properly, they would kick me.
Soon after we arrived, they started to make me do military drills. An armed police officer demonstrated how to squat, stand to attention, stand at ease, turn and salute, each position requiring precise movements and timing. When I squatted, I had to put my hands behind my neck and keep my body straight. I had to practice folding a blanket into a right angle, like the shape of tofu. This was not easy for me. The hardest part for me was giving military salutes to my captors.
Their purpose was to break my determination, to make me accept their power. They sometimes use this kind of military training on detainees they donât like. The armed police in China have strong bodies, but very simple minds.
Liu Shuhui
Mr. Liu, born in 1966, practiced law for a decade until the authorities refused to renew his license in 2010. In February 2011, he was assaulted by plainclothes security officers in Guangzhou for trying to photograph a demonstration that was part of what was called the Jasmine Revolution. The assault left him with deep bruises and a gash on his left leg. Days later he was arrested and held in secret detention for four months; his wife, who is Vietnamese, was held for 17 days, then deported.
I wasnât allowed to sleep the first night, or the second, or the third. Even when I wasnât being interrogated, I had to sit upright on a chair, and that was exhausting after a long time. I would nod off sometimes. The officers would slam the table next to me and yell. My leg kept swelling, and the pain in my chest grew. I didnât know how long I could tolerate it.
âExhausting an eagleâ is an expression that is used to describe the torture of extended sleep deprivation. I knew about this torture technique. Since it was usually reserved for serious crimes under Chinese law, I hadnât come across it much. It was from an older time. I had rarely seen or heard of clients who had suffered it, and in the rare cases they had, it was usually for a day or, at most, two.
I realized I was in a place where the law does not exist, a black hole, a camp controlled by monsters.
Tang Zhishun
Mr. Tang, originally trained as an engineer, became involved in civil rights activism when fighting to keep the authorities from tearing down his home. He was seized while helping the teenage son of the human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband, Boa Longjun, cross the border into Myanmar. Their accounts of secret detention are also included in the volume. The son, Bao Zhuxuan, now 18, was again barred this month from leaving the country by officials who described him as a security threat. Mr. Tang served more than a year in detention, first under residential surveillance, then in a regular detention center in Tianjin.
At times the guards warned me that my wife and child, despite being in the United States, were not as safe as I might think they were. Chinese agents could still kill them. They said the same about my mother. All I owned, money, valuables, they could take everything.
At one point, they informed me that the charge against me had been changed from illegally crossing a national border to inciting subversion of state power. What a threat! They really overestimated me.
The policemen would say they held no personal grudge against me, but they acted with such cruelty, tortured me the way they did, as if knowing that it was not personal would somehow change anything. I believe justice comes for everyone one day, and those who have done wrong will get the punishment they deserve.

"As China Rises, Australia Asks Itself: Can It Rely on America?","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1971822171?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â When the Australian government set out to write a new foreign policy paper, it faced hotly contested questions shaping the countryâs future: Will China replace the United States as the dominant power in Asia? If so, how quickly?
The governmentâs answers came in a so-called white paper released last month by the administration of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. For sure, China is challenging the United States in Asia, though in the end, it argues, America will prevail and Australia can count on its security guarantor of the past 70 years.
But a prominent defense strategist, Hugh White, has disputed that view, arguing in a provocative new essay that China has arrived, the United States is fading and Australia must find a way to survive on its own.
The contrasting assessments have set off a debate in Australia about the durability of the American alliance and Chinaâs intentions toward Australia.
The government tried to reassure the public that there was no need to make a choice between China, Australiaâs biggest trade partner, and the United States, its security patron. Despite the America First policies of President Trump, who is unpopular in Australia, the United States of old would endure. Australia would deal with the changing environment, it said, by working âharder to maximize our international influence.â
The arguments come against a backdrop of concerns over Chinaâs growing influence in Australia. These include allegations of Chinese meddling in Australian universities and news stories about ethnically Chinese businessmen with connections to the government in Beijing giving generously to election campaigns.
Australiaâs heavy reliance on iron ore and energy exports to China has long raised questions about the need to diversify its economy. However, dependence on China has only grown, as an influx of Chinese students and travelers now also helps to sustain the higher education and tourism industries.
Australia has tried to balance its growing economic dependence on China with its longstanding post-World War II security relationship with the United States.
But Chinaâs assertive behavior in the South China Sea, and Mr. Trumpâs decision to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade pact America once sought to lead, have rattled the underpinnings of Australiaâs policies.
Australiaâs leaders have gone beyond the white paperâs careful reassurances, openly declaring that Australia must confront the shifting power dynamics of the region.
Mr. Turnbull has called this the first time in Australiaâs history that its dominant trading partner was not also its dominant security partner. He argued that the country should see this as an opportunity and not a risk, but his comments were also laced with uncertainty and concern.
âNow power is shifting, and the rules and institutions are under challenge,â he said. âThe major players are testing their relationships with each other, while undergoing rapid change themselves.â
Foreign policy experts say the white paperâs assessment of American staying power does not reflect a growing consensus among many Australian policymakers that the United States, at least under its current leadership, cannot be relied on as a stable partner.
Michael Fullilove, executive director at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, described what many Australians see as a fraying of the liberal international order because, he said, âthe president of the United States is neither liberal in his inclinations nor orderly in his behavior.â
Many say itâs time for Australia to stop pretending about American intentions, and begin considering other options. This view has found one of its clearest and most strident voices in Mr. White, whose 27,000-word essay bluntly argues that Australia needs to wake up: The game is over and China has already won.
âWe all underestimated Chinaâs power and resolve and overestimated Americaâs,â wrote Mr. White, who worked on sensitive intelligence and military matters with the United States as a senior official at the Australian Defense Department. âNot only is America failing to remain the dominant power, it is failing to retain any substantial strategic role at all.â
In reply to the governmentâs paper, Mr. White said Australiaâs stance was unrealistic because it clung too much to the vestiges of a fading power that would not be able to stay ahead of Chinaâs economic strength.
âThe paper has an elegiac feel, the sense of a sunset,â he said in an interview.
The biggest splash came from Mr. Whiteâs recommendations for what Australia should do about an American retreat. Faced with what he called Chinese efforts to impose its influence and different political values, he said Australia will have to do more to defend itself, including perhaps even one day acquiring nuclear weapons.
He said Chinaâs rise is likely to spark an arms race in the Asia-Pacific, with both Japan and South Korea likely to become nuclear powers within a couple of decades.
âAnd the logic that drives them has implications for others,â Mr. White said. Australia could remain a middle power, he said, by keeping only a small nuclear arsenal. âIt might look something like Britainâs submarine-based nuclear force,â he wrote.
American officials have tried to counter such conclusions. During his visit to Sydney in April, Vice President Mike Pence told Australian business and government leaders that the United States remains Australiaâs most vital economic partner, with American investment growing by 50 percent in the past three years.
Another sign that Washington may seek to reassure its Australian allies has been talk of the possible appointment of Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the United States commander in the Pacific, as the next ambassador to Australia. Some American officials have said they would welcome the move because it would send a message to China that the United States will not retreat.
Australian media have chimed in, calling Admiral Harris âChinaâs least favorite American.â Still, itâs far from clear whether that would be enough to offset the deep concerns here about President Trump.
Australia has also tried to hedge its bets by reaching out to other democracies in the region, particularly Japan and India. Citing concerns about Chinaâs advance into the South China Sea, the governmentâs white paper backed the idea of joining India, Japan and the United States to promote a free and democratic Indo-Pacific region that could offset China.
In China, the Foreign Ministry took offense at the comments about the South China Sea, saying Australia had no business meddling. The state-run Global Times suggested China might retaliate with boycotts in tourism and higher education.
âFortunately, the country is not that important and China can move its ties with Australia to a back seat and disregard its sensitivities,â the newspaper said.
In his essay, Mr. White warned that Beijing could use its growing naval power to ramp up pressure by contesting Australiaâs claims to remote pieces of Australian territory, such as islands that it controls in the Antarctic, or by deploying forces to South Pacific neighbors, where China enjoys good relations.
Analysts sympathetic to the Turnbull government have pushed back, saying Mr. Whiteâs essay paints an overly alarmist picture.
âWhile many of the trends in the region are concerning, White underestimates Americaâs stake in the region,â said Andrew Shearer, who was an adviser to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Mr. White is âis premature in reaching the conclusion that President Trump will acquiesce to Chinese supremacy, and that the United States is already withdrawing.â
Still, the essay performed a useful service, Mr. Shearer said, by drawing attention to the rapidly shifting balance of power in Asia and the need for a more coherent response by Washington.
Some Chinese analysts said Mr. White may have overstated Chinaâs success in the region. âThe U.S. is still very much wanted and needed by regional countries, including Australia. The white paper makes that clear,â said Zhang Baohui, professor of international affairs at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.
But by 2030, Mr. Zhang said, China will have won the geopolitical race. âEveryone will then live under the shadow of Chinese power,â he said.
America does not get entirely short shrift from Mr. White. âIt wonât be the dominant power in Asia,â he wrote, âbut it will have both the means and the motive to exert some influence over Chinaâs conduct â including in East Asia â through the global system in which it will play a key role.â

Beijing Bids Goodbye to Robert Mugabe,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2017,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1979764396?accountid=14586,"As the line of Chinese-made armored vehicles rumbled into Harare last month, Zimbabweâs 93-year-old dictator, Robert Mugabe, must have wondered what happened to the âall-weather friendshipâ Beijing always said they shared. For nearly four decades, Mugabe had been one of Chinaâs staunchest allies. His âLook Eastâ policy signaled Africaâs economic shift away from the West toward the rising superpower. Yet as the bloodless coup against him unfolded, Beijing offered no words of support or sympathy. Instead, there was silence â until afterward, when President Xi Jinping of China rushed to congratulate Mugabeâs successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa.
The circumstances surrounding the end of Mugabeâs 37-year reign are the stuff of spy novels: a high-level meeting in Beijing four days earlier, the armed showdown at Harare airport, the old dictatorâs last-ditch attempt to assert his authority. But the episode also tells a tale of Chinaâs evolving relationship with the world it is shaping through loans, trade and investments. In an era when the United States seems to be on the retreat â notice the absence of Americans from this story â it can be easy to shrug off Chinaâs advance as another instance of its rapid, ineluctable expansion. But the fall of Mugabe, a charismatic despot who drove his economy to ruin, shows how Beijing is learning to navigate, very carefully, through turbulent transitions in places where it has deep economic ties, sometimes decades old, and how countries bend to the arc of Chinaâs gravity.
Mugabe is among the last of a dying breed, a revolutionary hero whose relationship with China was forged in Africaâs anticolonial struggle and shifted over time into an economic and diplomatic partnership. When the West issued sanctions against Mugabeâs government in the early 2000s for a multitude of sins â human rights abuses, violent farm invasions, electoral fraud â China defended its ally and poured money into Zimbabweâs diamond mines and tobacco farms. It supplied weapons and fighter jets, roads and electricity plants. At a packed rally in the Chinese-built national stadium in Harare, Mugabe exulted: âWe have turned East, where the sun rises, and given our backs to the West, where the sun sets.â
It seemed that the sun would never set on Mugabe, even as he exploited his citizens and presided over the economyâs destruction. In 2009, after a bout of hyperinflation so bad that the government printed $100 trillion notes that couldnât even pay for a loaf of bread, Zimbabwe abandoned its currency and adopted the U.S. dollar as the principal means of exchange. Even so, in 2015, President Xi made a state visit to Zimbabwe, lavishing praise on Mugabe and pledging $4 billion in energy projects. Reciprocating the good will, Mugabe made a move that would flatter Beijingâs global ambition: Zimbabwe announced that it would become the first foreign country to accept the Chinese yuan as an official currency.
Behind the scenes , though, Beijing was growing alarmed. Mugabeâs disastrous handling of the economy had gone on for years, leaving more than 60 percent of the population below the poverty line â and government debts to China unpaid. But what provoked Beijingâs ire in early 2016 was a decision to enforce an âindigenizationâ law that required foreign ventures to reserve at least 51 percent of their ownership for local Zimbabweans. The law was meant to promote black empowerment, as well as Mugabeâs popularity. But China felt the law unfairly targeted its investments, including two diamond mines, whose assets were to be absorbed into a state-owned company. So angered were Chinese leaders that they summoned Zimbabweâs foreign minister to Beijing to hear their grievances.
For China, there loomed a bigger danger and opportunity: the long-awaited political transition. As the nonagenarian Mugabe approached the end of his term in 2018, China feared chaos. But after decades of waiting, it hoped to push a freer investment climate that would open up Zimbabweâs abundant mineral resources. As a one-party state, China has preferred to deal with ruling parties and their often-authoritarian leaders â and to hope that these old friends never pass from the scene, like the Communist Party itself. The âwake-up call,â says Yun Sun, a senior associate at the Stimson Center in Washington, came in Libya with the fall of the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. China was heavily invested in Libya â it imported 10 percent of the countryâs oil supply â but blindsided by the revolt against its ally. During the turmoil, more than 30,000 Chinese workers had to be airlifted out of Libya, and China lost billions of dollarsâ worth of investments and loans.
Elsewhere, Chinaâs sheer size could pull wayward countries back into its orbit. In Zambia, the poor treatment of workers at Chinese-run copper mines provoked a national outcry. The populist Michael Sata ran for the presidency in 2006 on an anti-Chinese platform, vowing to prevent Zambia from becoming a âdumping groundâ for Chinese workers. His defeat led to the first anti-Chinese riots in Africa. Five years later, Sata again whipped up anger at Chinese âprofiteersâ and won the presidency easily. Once in office, however, the old firebrand mellowed. He was soon a compliant partner with Beijing â a sign, perhaps, that Chinaâs influence on the Zambian economy had become so vital that fighting against it would be too costly.
The situation was different in Zimbabwe, where the uncertainty over succession spawned two sides vying for Chinaâs favor. Mugabeâs heir apparent was Vice President Mnangagwa, a former security chief who trained as a guerrilla in China in the 1960s and earned the nickname âCrocodile.â Mugabe, however, wanted to hand the reins over to his 52-year-old wife, Grace, who studied in China. Last month, when Mnangagwa threatened to stop her, Mugabe fired him. As the Crocodile went into hiding, Zimbabweâs army chief, his ally, flew to Beijing for an official visit with top military leaders. Barely four days after he returned to Zimbabwe, the coup was underway.
Suspicions about Beijingâs role in the takeover were only magnified when, in his first week in office, Mnangagwa relaxed the âindigenizationâ law â and signed a $153 million loan agreement with China. Beijing, citing its official policy of noninterference, vehemently denies any involvement in the coup. And indeed, such subterfuge seems more in line with past actions of the United States, which secretly helped topple governments from Iran to Chile during the 20th century. But even if Chinese officials told Zimbabweâs army chief in Beijing they merely hoped for a more stable investment environment, this could still be regarded as the first coup dâÃ©tat carried out with the tacit approval of the 21st centuryâs emerging superpower.
China may be new to coups, but itâs one of the oldest players in the global money game. In the past few years, two separate teams of scientists have found medieval Chinese coins along Kenyaâs ocean coast. These tiny discs essentially rewrite the history of global trade, showing that Chinese traders reached Africa in the early 15th century, nearly a century before the first European explorers. This is not just a matter of pride. As China now moves to expand its influence in Africa, its state-owned media outlets have seized on these discoveries as proof of Chinaâs historical links to the continent â and as the perfect rationale for its return.
The coins themselves were symbols of monetary might. First introduced in the 3rd century B.C. by Chinaâs first emperor, the uniform copper coin served as an instrument for Chinaâs unification and later its expanding power. The round coins had square holes so they could be strung into belts of a thousand. The belts got so heavy that Chinese merchants in the 9th century began depositing them in one place in return for a paper receipt. They called it fei qian, or âflying money.â When Marco Polo returned from his travels to China in the 13th century, his tales of paper money were met with disbelief. Europe would not have anything similar until the late 1600s.
When Mugabe promised to make the Chinese yuan an official currency, it was mostly a symbolic gesture. There, as in many of the worldâs poorest countries, the U.S. dollar reigns supreme, despite almost no American presence. But Chinese economic power is starting to challenge that status. Beijingâs push to internationalize the yuan is motivated by more than vanity. A yuan that circulates more widely would spur Chinese trade, reduce its dependence on dollar holdings and enhance its geopolitical influence. The yuan is hampered by restrictions on its trade on foreign-âexchange markets; Beijing fears that full convertibility would trigger capital flight. Even so, the yuanâs rise is beginning ever so slightly to nudge the system of global currencies away from the U.S. dollar. Last year, the International Monetary Fund added the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies. According to the Bank of China, as of last year, more than two dozen countries were accepting the yuan as a reserve currency, including six in Africa.
The American economy surpassed the British economy in size in 1872, but it took the dollar another 73 years to displace the British pound, at the end of World War II. Over the past decades, there have been other contenders and pretenders: the yen, the mark, the euro. But given its rapid rise â and its acceptance in distant parts of Africa â the yuan might be in the best position to catch the dollar. It may take decades, even centuries. But China, it should be clear by now, is in it for the very long haul.

China Reaches Into the Heart of Europe,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1999791206?accountid=14586,"BERLIN â The previous time I lived in Berlin, in 2000, China had recently bought a building by the Spree River to use for a sprawling new embassy, and the staff would bully the clients of a women-only gym that had a lease on the top floor with verbal insults and by making them undergo intimidating security checks.
The bizarre practice was aimed, apparently, at forcing out the gym and securing use of the entire building for China. It worked. Today, the silver and mirror-clad embassy sparkles by the spinach-colored waters of the Spree, satellite dishes and antennas poking out on top.
Iâm back in Berlin, having spent the intervening years reporting in Beijing as China vaulted from sixth place to second in global economic strength, pushing down Germany from third to fourth. Returning to this country from China, I am struck by how Beijing is asserting its interests here in ways that threaten Germanyâs core values, going well beyond intimidating gym-going women.
Germany must end Chinese meddling in its hard-earned democracy. Berlin has a stronger hand than many Germans appear to realize: China does not want to lose the good will and cooperation of this technologically strong and politically influential partner in the heart of Europe. Germany should be pushing back against Chinese interference with consistency and strength, just as China does when it feels its core interests are threatened.
In recent months China has sent up a series of trial balloons to see how far it can stretch the boundaries of German democracy. First and most easily spotted: challenges to free speech and political protest on German soil.
Take an incident in November, when the Chinese halted a soccer match between their under-20 team and TSV Schott Mainz in southwestern Germany to protest a handful of Tibetans and German fans with Tibetan âsnow lionâ flags. China regards the flags as a sign of resistance to its rule in Tibet. The Chinese players returned to the field only after the flags were furled. (China lost, 3-0.)
âOf course we stand by freedom of expression,â Ronny Zimmermann, a vice president of German soccerâs governing body, said afterward. âOur partner hasnât really been able to get used to it yet.â A planned series of matches has been postponed. Germany has an excellent opportunity to defend democracy by canceling them until China agrees to respect free speech and political protest here.
A month later, in December, the president of Germanyâs domestic intelligence agency warned of âa broad attempt to infiltrate regional Parliaments, ministries and administrationsâ by Chinese agents to recruit German sources using fake social media accounts.
Chinese diplomats have also exerted pressure to stop town halls from flying the snow lion flag on March 10 in commemoration of the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, said Michael Brand, a member of the federal Parliament, the Bundestag. The Interior Ministry in the southern state of Bavaria asked local governments in 2016 to reconsider the practice after Chinese diplomats contacted the ministry.
The problem, Mr. Brand said in an interview, is âGermany isnât really defending itself.â
He should know. In 2016, Chinaâs ambassador to Germany told Mr. Brand, who was at the time chairman of the Bundestagâs human rights committee, that he could travel to China only if he canceled certain speaking engagements in Germany and deleted images and words from his official home page.
Mr. Brand refused and was barred from China. He said his government did little in retaliation. About a month after his travel ban, German-Chinese cabinet consultations took place as scheduled in Beijing, with Chancellor Angela Merkel in attendance. It was a missed opportunity: Germany should have skipped the talks as a warning to China to stop interfering in the affairs of elected German officials.
Sure, people here are preoccupied with challenges closer to home, including hard-right populism in Central Europe, Vladimir Putinâs Russia, authoritarian Turkey, a million refugees from the Middle East, an unpredictable Donald Trump and Britainâs plan to leave the European Union.
These are all of concern. Yet none has Chinaâs combination of economic muscle and political authoritarianism.
China became Germanyâs most important trading partner in 2016, outranking the United States and France. That year Germany exported about $92 billion in goods to China and imported about $114 billion. Germany is dependent on exports and tends to run trade surpluses around the world â its relationship with China is an exception.
So what may finally focus German minds is âMade in China 2025,â Beijingâs ambitious plan to become the high-tech manufacturing center of the world.
The plan threatens Germanyâs long-term prosperity because it aims to substitute technologically advanced goods from Germany and other nations with cheaper Chinese goods, first at home, then throughout the world. When â if â China replaces German technology in electric-powered vehicles, robotics and a host of other engineering, Germany may face tougher times.
Other democracies, notably Australia, are beginning to realize they must push back against the efforts by the secrecy-ridden Communist Party to shape the global narrative about China in order to secure its control at home and abroad.
Germany, as Europeâs central power and biggest economy, should monitor attempts to weaken its democratic system and publicize them so that citizens can educate and protect themselves. It should decline to sell to China economic assets of strategic value, deepen financial transparency in academic research and politics to prevent influence-buying by cash-rich China, and use its standing in Brussels to help smaller European Union members do the same. China will complain loudly but will get the message that Germany is serious about defending democracy.
Itâs worth remembering that West Germany banned its own Communist Party in 1956, fearful of the influence of the Soviet Union. No one wants a return of Cold War mentalities, but that history offers a precedent for prohibiting activities here by the Communist Party of China, for example within student associations, as a firm warning to Beijing.
Germany expects students and businessmen from China to live here with democratic values, as most already do, and leave authoritarianism at home.
Otherwise, what will become of those post-World War II German freedoms won at a horrible price to the world and to itself?

"As Xi Tightens His Grip on China, U.S. Sees Conflict Ahead","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049861640?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â A few weeks after Stephen K. Bannon left the White House in August, he was invited to a dinner at the Council on Foreign Relations to discuss American policy toward China. With his unbridled China bashing and dark talk of a looming conflict in the Pacific, Mr. Bannon expected to be roughed up by the group, which included China scholars, writers and veterans from past Republican and Democratic administrations.
Mr. Bannonâs hosts were hard on him, but not in the way he expected. Rather than faulting him or his former boss, President Trump, for their hostile approach, they pressed him on why Mr. Trump had not followed through with his tough talk about trade and North Korea. âI walked out of there thinking, âSomething has changed with the elite,ââ he recalled.
Chinaâs relentless rise and its more recent embrace of repressive tactics that recall the Mao era â a process accelerated by President Xi Jinpingâs bid to stay in power indefinitely â have fractured a deeply rooted consensus in Washington about the long-term direction of its relationship with Beijing.
Gone is a widespread agreement among diplomats, scholars and businesspeople that China is gradually converging with the United States and, therefore, that Americans should work to manage any flare-ups between the two countries. With China now unabashedly charting its own course â one that diverges rather than converges with the liberal democracies and market economies of the West â conflict, many say, is inevitable.
âEven those who are the most optimistic, hopeful and in some ways romantic about the U.S.-China relationship have been forced to confront a new China,â said Kurt M. Campbell, who, as an assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, was an architect of the Obama administrationâs policy of pivoting toward the East.
Mr. Xiâs power grab has thrown this new China into stark relief, âexacerbating the fault line that already exists between China and the liberal democracies of the world,â said Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society.
The disillusionment with China, he said, began setting in long before Mr. Xi cemented his grip on the Politburo. Be it saber-rattling in the South China Sea, proselytizing on American college campuses, theft of corporate secrets or censorship of the web, China has alienated one constituency after another in the United States.
âThe military is gone, the press is gone, the intellectuals are gone, civil society is gone and now the businessmen are gone,â said Mr. Schell, who arranged the dinner for Mr. Bannon and has deep ties to China. âIf youâre taking the long view, youâd have to say weâre on diverging pathways.â
Beyond a general spike in tensions, however, the results of this widening divide are difficult to predict, experts and former officials said, because it is occurring against a backdrop of uncertainty in Beijing and Washington.
Mr. Xiâs ascension, experts said, reflects not only his formidable power but also Chinaâs economic instability. Markets were rattled by news last week that the Chinese government seized the Anbang Insurance Group, a debt-ridden conglomerate that owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and once negotiated to invest in a Manhattan skyscraper owned by the family of the presidentâs son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
Mr. Trumpâs handling of China reflects not only his protectionist trade agenda and America First foreign policy, but also his reluctance to antagonize Mr. Xi personally â a peculiar deference that prompted the tough questions directed at Mr. Bannon over dinner.
For all his thunderous criticism of China as an economic predator, Mr. Trump has yet to impose a sweeping trade sanction against it. He declined to label China a currency manipulator last year because he said the timing was bad: Mr. Xi had agreed to help the United States press North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile programs.
âChina, we probably lost $504 billion, last year, on trade,â Mr. Trump said on Monday at a meeting with governors, a day after Mr. Xiâs bid to lead indefinitely became public. But he added: âI think that President Xi is unique. Heâs helping us with North Korea.â
The White House is preparing tariffs on steel and aluminum that would target China and other exporters. It has conducted an investigation into Chinaâs theft of intellectual property, which could result in restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and retaliatory measures against its consumer electronics products.
Domestic politics, in a year of midterm elections, may drive Mr. Trump to take a harder line. Democrats, who are historically closer to Mr. Trump on trade than most Republicans, have signaled that they will use the presidentâs tough-on-China stance against him if he does not act soon.
âNow that itâs clear that President Xi isnât going anywhere, getting tough on China is even more of an imperative,â said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. âIf President Trump and Congress donât crack down on their rapacious trade practices,â he added, âChina will continue eating our lunch for years to come.â
Corporate America has long acted as a lubricant for the relationship, prodding the United States to bring China into the World Trade Organization and lobbying against punitive trade practices. But after years of struggling to break into the Chinese markets, suffering the theft of their corporate secrets, many American companies are exhausted.
âYouâre hearing businesses that work in China use words like reciprocity and retaliation far more than you ever have,â said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. âFolks are increasingly frustrated and wrestling with how best to deal with it.â
The frustration is not across the board: Manufacturers tend to be more fed up than Wall Street, which continues to do lucrative investment-banking business with the Chinese government. Technology companies have soured on China, though the market is so vast that they are still willing to consider concessions they would make nowhere else in the world.
The Trump administration reflects those fissures. Advisers like Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who both worked at Goldman Sachs, have persuaded Mr. Trump to hold off on tough trade measures against China in the past.
But there are signs that the White Houseâs nationalist wing is ascendant. Peter Navarro, an economist whose books include âDeath by Chinaâ and âThe Coming China Wars,â is to be promoted, and his ideas seem again in vogue with the president.
On the issue of national security, the administration enshrined a harsher stance toward China in the presidentâs National Security Strategy. The report characterized China in Cold War-like terms, as a revisionist power that will try âto erode American security and prosperity.â
Chinaâs influence on bastions of higher education has also come under scrutiny. The director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, testified recently that he believed universities were underestimating the ability of Chinese students to collect valuable national security intelligence. He expressed concern about the Confucius Institute, a global learning network sponsored by the Chinese government, whose expansion has elicited criticism over whether it is a tool to influence public opinion about China.
By itself, some former officials said, Mr. Xiâs move to stay in power should not augur greater conflict with the United States. He is expected to elevate Wang Qishan to vice president and give him a major role in managing the relationship. And he dispatched a senior economic adviser, Liu He, to Washington this week to meet with the administration. Both men are respected in the United States.
âI donât think thereâs something inherent in dictatorships and one-man rule that causes clashes with U.S. interests, other than, of course, the conflict in values,â said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama.
For some China hands, the wave of disillusionment reflects unrealistic hopes about how much China was ever going to converge with the United States. John L. Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president who has taught at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that in a chaotic world, the two countries should focus on what unites, rather than what divides, them.
âAt one end of the spectrum is order and at the other end is disorder,â Mr. Thornton said. âChina and the United States are clearly on the same end of the spectrum.â

China Presses Its Internet Censorship Efforts Across the Globe,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049868721?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI â Within its digital borders, China has long censored what its people read and say online. Now, it is increasingly going beyond its own online realms to police what people and companies are saying about it all over the world.
For years, China has exerted digital control with a system of internet filters known as the Great Firewall, which allows authorities to limit what people see online. To broaden its censorship efforts, Beijing is venturing outside the Great Firewall and paying more attention to what its citizens are saying on non-Chinese apps and services.
As part of that shift, Beijing has at times pressured foreign companies like Google and Facebook, which are both blocked in China, to take down certain content. At other times, it has bypassed foreign companies entirely and instead directly pushed users of global social media to encourage self-censorship.
This effort is accelerating as President Xi Jinping consolidates his power. The Chinese leadership is expected to officially abolish term limits at a meeting that begins next week, giving Mr. Xi outsize authority over the countryâs direction.
Zhang Guanghong recently discovered the changing landscape for technology firsthand. Mr. Zhang, a Chinese human rights activist, decided last fall to share an article with a group of friends in and outside China that criticized Chinaâs president. To do so, he used WhatsApp, an American app owned by Facebook that almost nobody uses in China.
In September, Mr. Zhang was detained in China; he is expected to soon be charged with insulting Chinaâs government and the Communist Party. The evidence, according to his lawyer, included printouts of what Mr. Zhang shared and said in the WhatsApp group.
That information was likely obtained by hacking his phone or through a spy in his group chat, said China tech experts, without involving WhatsApp. Mr. Zhangâs case is one of the first-known examples of Chinese authorities using conversations from a non-Chinese chat app as evidence â and it sends a warning to those on the American platform, which is encrypted, that they could also be held accountable for whatâs said there.
âChina is increasingly throwing its weight around,â said Joshua Rosenzweig, an analyst at Amnesty International.
As Mr. Xi asserts himself and the primacy of Chinese geopolitical power, China has also become more comfortable projecting Mr. Xiâs vision of a tightly controlled internet. Beijing had long been content to block foreign internet companies and police the homegrown alternatives that sprouted up to take their place, but it is now directly pressuring individuals or requesting that companies cooperate with its online censorship efforts.
That puts many American tech giants in a tricky position, especially those that want access to Chinaâs vast internet market of more than 700 million strong. In the past, these companies have typically gone to great lengths to gain a toehold in China. Facebook created a censorship tool it did not use and released an app in the country without putting its name to it. Apple is moving data storage for its Chinese customers into China and last year took down software that skirts Chinaâs internet blocks from its China App Store. Google recently said it would open a new artificial intelligence lab in the country.
Often, these companies have little recourse when pressured for help by Beijing. Going to the American government could set off retaliation from China, so many have sought to navigate the situation on their own.
âI personally am not sure what the solution is for these companies,â said Mr. Rosenzweig. âI donât see a good answer because the Chinese government is really putting them between a rock and a hard place.â
China leaned heavily on major internet companies when Guo Wengui, a Chinese tycoon in self-imposed exile, went on Facebook and YouTube to accuse a number of Chinese officials of corruption. Chinese officials last year complained to Google, which owns YouTube, and Facebook, according to people familiar with the events who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.
Facebook suspended Mr. Guoâs account. In a statement, the company said the account published the personal information of others without their consent, which violated the platformâs policies. A spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Beijingâs complaints played a role.
Chinese authorities have also successfully persuaded Google to pull down content that had been available around the globe.
The Chinese government asked Googleâs services to take down 2,290 items in the first half of last year, according to the companyâs statistics. That was more than triple the number it requested in the second half of 2016, which itself had set a record.
Content related to terrorism made up a substantial portion of the material China asked Google to take down, according to its data. The majority of Chinaâs recent takedown requests focused on videos on YouTube, the data showed. A Google spokesman said the company would not comment further on specific takedown requests.
Chinese officials may have even bigger censorship ambitions.
At a major Chinese internet conference last year, Mei Jianming, a Chinese antiterrorism expert, said Beijing should put more pressure on companies like Twitter. The goal would be to get them to change their terms of service so they could restrict posts by groups that Beijing considers subversive, like the World Uyghur Congress, which seeks self-determination for the people of the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.
Mr. Mei called for a crackdown on tweets that âdefame the party, Chinese leaders, and related national strategies.â
Sometimes, Chinese people also push foreign companies to censor themselves in the country, nurtured by sentiments on Chinaâs propaganda channels.
Daimler, the German carmaker, apologized in February after its Mercedes-Benz brand posted an inspirational quote on Facebookâs Instagram that it attributed to the Dalai Lama. Chinaâs government views the Tibetan Buddhist leader as a champion of independence for Tibet, and Mercedes-Benz faced withering criticism from Chinese online users who shared those views.
Mercedes-Benz erased the post â even though few people in China could see it because Chinese authorities block Instagram. Still, criticism continued. The Peopleâs Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, branded Mercedes-Benz an âenemy of the people.â
China is Mercedes-Benzâs biggest single car market, accounting for about one-quarter of sales.
âChina is getting stronger,â said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and a former Google employee. âTheyâre getting more confident in putting pressure on these platforms.â
China is also requiring individuals to police what they say on global social media. In a prominent conviction last year of a human-rights activist, Lee Ming-che, the Chinese police used writing that he had posted on Facebook from Taiwan as evidence against him.
âThe fact that China is punishing people for critical content published outside China to audiences not based in China is of course a concern,â said Mr. Rosenzweig.
The case of Mr. Zhang, the Chinese individual under scrutiny for what he posted on WhatsApp, could indicate a further extension of Chinaâs reach.
The Chinese police have previously focused on activists for what they say on foreign social media, but Mr. Zhangâs case seems to be one of the first in which someone has been charged for spreading articles on WhatsApp. Because WhatsApp is encrypted and run by a foreign company, it is generally considered a safer platform than local messaging app WeChat, which has for years been closely monitored by Chinese authorities.
Mr. Zhangâs lawyer, Sui Muqing, said he was surprised when the police presented him with printouts of articles and comments from Mr. Zhang.
âThey didnât get the information from him, but they have it,â Mr. Sui said. âThat was what we found so weird. None of us knew how they were capable of getting that data and whether WhatsApp has become unsafe.â
Experts said the information was likely gleaned from somebody within Mr. Zhangâs WhatsApp group or by accessing Mr. Zhangâs phone directly, not by hacking WhatsApp. Chinese officials formally blocked WhatsApp in China about the time of Mr. Zhangâs detention.
A spokeswoman for WhatsApp said Chinese authorities did not have backdoor access to its encrypted messages. Chinaâs Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment.
âWhen I talk about technology and the internet, people normally pine for them and look forward to a future that will promote liberalization,â Mr. Sui said. âBut people neglect the fact that modern authoritarianism also rises with the development of technology, which makes wider and deeper control possible.â

"Chinaâs Women-Only Subway Cars, Where Men Rush In","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049868733?accountid=14586,"In one of Chinaâs biggest cities, the women-only subway cars are full of men.
It is, perhaps, an inescapable reality in one of the worldâs busiest metro systems. Hop on a train during rush hour in the southern city of Guangzhou and you may find your face pressed against the back of a manâs down jacket, your knees banged by someoneâs tote and your torso poked by a migrant workerâs sack of construction tools.
Room is hard to find. So when the Guangzhou government began reserving cars for female passengers worried about being groped and harassed, they filled up â but not with the intended passengers.
âMen are totally clueless,â said Lu Lili, a 28-year-old bank employee, who was waiting for a train on Guangzhouâs Line 1 to appear. âItâs basically all the men trying to squeeze in.â
She gestured at the passengers like her, waiting for a women-only car. Many were men.
âIn the past, there would be workers trying to tell them and remind them repeatedly: âThis is a women-only car,ââ she said. âBut all these men still want to rush over. They really are uncivilized.â
The women-only subway cars are in many ways a metaphor for China. It is a country with too many laws but, in many areas, too little enforcement. The government bans gender discrimination but does not define what it is. Those who complain risk getting punished. As a result, women who have been sexually harassed rarely file police reports. Offenders are almost never brought to justice.
Based on a proposal from a member of a key political advisory body to the ruling Communist Party, the effort was launched to push the concept of âcaring for women and respecting women.â Ye Zichuan, the head of Guangzhou Metroâs publicity department, stressed that the cars were labeled for women but not âonly for women.â He said that there was no legal basis to segregate passengers by force.
The designated subway cars â two at the back of the line â are meant to be in effect only on weekdays and during the morning and evening rush hours. The doors for those cars are labeled âwomen carsâ in pink Chinese characters and festooned with illustrations of blossoms.
Critics in China say they serve only as a distraction from the real problem of male attitudes there.
Female commuters in China have long complained that some men take advantage of the packed trains to cop a quick feel. More than half of women surveyed by the state-run China Youth Daily newspaper in 2015 said they had experienced âinappropriate touchingâ on public transportation in China.
Jane Zhao, 25, a human resources executive in an e-commerce company, said a man once groped her chest on the subway.
âBut because there were so many people, you donât know who did it, so itâs difficult to call anyone out,â she said, adding that she had heard similar stories from her colleagues. âYou donât dare to make a scene in the car.â
In a bid to raise awareness of the problem of sexual harassment on public transportation, a group of young feminists in Guangzhou raised more than $6,000 last year from the public for an advertising campaign.
But the authorities blocked it, saying it would cause âpanic to the public,â according to Xiao Meili, one of the founders of the collective. The authorities later told them that only government organizations were allowed to sponsor public-interest ads, Ms. Xiao said.
Ms. Xiao called the concept of women-only subway cars âreally stupid.â
âOn the surface, it looks like the women-only subway cars are meant to protect women,â she said, âbut the effect is that women are told that they have to stay in one place in order to avoid getting sexually harassed.â
Then, there is the issue of the crowds. Guangzhou has the worldâs fourth-busiest metro system, after Shanghai, Beijing and London, according to Metrobits, a nonprofit website that analyzes urban transportation systems globally.
In a day, there are roughly eight million passenger trips on the Guangzhou subway, Mr. Ye, the city subway official, said by email. During rush hour, the average rail car has 310 passengers, he said.
Weary subway workers, wearing red vests emblazoned with the word âvolunteer,â say that shortly after the cars were designated for women, they tried dissuading male passengers, with little success. They spend their time mainly yelling at passengers to âmove into the center of the train!â and âdonât squeeze on board if thereâs no more space!â
Many of the men on the cars said they supported the idea and wound up in one for women by accident.
âMen should give way to women and display their care and concern for women,â said Jiang Hui, 25, a bank worker, who was lingering near the line for the cars designated for women. âAfter all, womenâs bodies are weaker than menâs.â

"How Xi Jinping Made His Power Grab: With Stealth, Speed and Guile","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://se arch.proquest.com/docview/2049871100?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Some 200 senior Communist Party officials gathered behind closed doors in January to take up a momentous political decision: whether to abolish presidential term limits and enable Xi Jinping to lead China for a generation.
In a two-day session in Beijing, they bowed to Mr. Xiâs wish to hold onto power indefinitely. But a bland communiquÃ© issued afterward made no mention of the weighty decision, which the authorities then kept under wraps for more than five weeks.
That meeting of the partyâs Central Committee was the culmination of months of secretive discussions that are only now coming to light â and show how Mr. Xi maneuvered with stealth, swiftness and guile to rewrite Chinaâs Constitution.
The decision was abruptly announced only last week, days before the annual session of Chinaâs legislature, the National Peopleâs Congress. The delay was apparently an effort to prevent opposition from coalescing before formal approval of the change by the legislatureâs nearly 3,000 members.
The congress is all but certain to approve the change and other constitutional amendments â the first since 2004 â in a vote on Sunday, sweeping away a rule that restricts presidents to two five-year terms and has been in the Constitution for 35 years. The congress alone has the power to amend the Constitution, by a two-thirds vote, but lawmakers, picked by the party, have always passed proposals presented to them.
Even those who thought that they had taken the full measure of Mr. Xiâs ambition are surprised by how fast he has moved.
âI always thought Xi would seek to stay for three or four terms, and could even introduce a new presidential system after his terms were finished. But I never thought the Constitution would be revised so quickly,â said Wu Wei, a former official who advised Zhao Ziyang, the party leader ousted during the mass protests of 1989 in Tiananmen Square.
âFor such a major revision to an important clause of the Constitution, the views of the whole public nationwide should have been more broadly sought,â he added, pausing to contain his emotion.
Mr. Xi deployed speed, secrecy and intimidation to smother potential opposition inside and outside the party. He swept past the consensus-building conventions that previous leaders used to amend the Constitution. He installed loyalists to draft and support the amendments. And he kept the whole process under the tight control of the party, allowing little debate, even internally.
Mr. Xi first formally proposed amending the Constitution little more than five months ago, at a Sept. 29 meeting of the Politburo, a council of 25 party leaders more powerful than the Central Committee, according to an official account issued at the congress on Monday.
But he did not immediately raise the possibility of removing the term limit, said a retired official, citing a senior serving official. To avoid being seen as dictating changes, Mr. Xi let loyal provincial and city leaders quietly promote the idea in his stead, the retired official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of punishment for describing internal discussions.
At that same meeting, the Politburo agreed to purge one of its own members, Sun Zhengcai, who had once been considered a potential successor to Mr. Xi, on corruption charges â a warning to other party officials that needed little elaboration.
Previous rounds of constitutional amendments in China took much longer and involved at least the trappings of public discussion.
Mr. Xiâs predecessor, Hu Jintao, proposed less significant constitutional changes 15 months before the amendments became law and tolerated some open debate, including forums held by liberal intellectuals. The wording of Mr. Huâs revisions was released to the public nearly three months before lawmakers approved them in March 2004.
By contrast, Mr. Xi first announced that he wanted to make constitutional changes in December, without specifying what they would be. The full details of the amendments, including the abolition of his term limit, were released to the public only eight days before the National Peopleâs Congress convened.
Mr. Xi kept a tight lid on his machinations. After the Politburo meeting in late September, he entrusted the task of revising the Constitution to just three officials: the chairman of the congress, Zhang Dejiang, and two close allies, Li Zhanshu and Wang Huning, both of whom were elevated last year into the Politburo Standing Committee, the partyâs top body.
Mr. Wang has long been sympathetic to the authoritarian argument that China needs a strongman to maintain social order while pushing through painful policies, such as closing down inefficient factories.
âIf somewhere lacks a central authority, or central authority is in decline, the country falls into a state of rupture and turmoil,â he said in an interview published in 1995.
In recent speeches, Mr. Xi has echoed that theme, arguing that China faces unprecedented risks and opportunities. âOur party was born under a sense of peril, grew up under a sense of peril and matured under a sense of peril,â he told a meeting of senior officials in December.
Momentum for ending the term limit built in November, when the party began secretly seeking suggestions on possible constitutional changes, according to the official account issued at the congress. Mr. Xiâs allies began an effort to support the change, and in a clue of their effectiveness, the official account said there was âconsistent approval for issuing new rules on the term of office of the president.â
Still, Mr. Xi needed to win approval for his plan at the January meeting of the Central Committee, and when and how he did so have been the subject of dispute.
Reuters, citing two unnamed sources, has reported that the Central Committee failed to reach a consensus at the January meeting and convened its next meeting earlier than usual.
But four party insiders â two retired officials, a party newspaper editor and a businessman with family links to the leadership â told The New York Times that Mr. Xi prevailed in January, essentially confirming the official timeline.
Any committee members with misgivings were unlikely to speak out, given the array of punishment they could face, and party elders who may have once opposed such a move â including Mr. Hu and another former president, Jiang Zemin â are too old or too cowed by Mr. Xiâs anticorruption investigations to muster resistance, party insiders said.
Mr. Xi gained the Central Committeeâs backing for ending the term limit just three months after winning his second term as party leader, his other main title, and before starting his second term as president.
âIt demonstrates Xiâs penchant for rule-breaking,â said Christopher K. Johnson, an expert on Chinese elite politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. âItâs slowly, slowly, slowly, and then when no oneâs looking, he turns around and does something big. I think it comes back to the political shock and awe that really dates back to his arrival.â
Several experts and former party officials who have met Mr. Xi said he appears to be driven to overturn the term limit out of a confluence of confidence and anxiety.
He is confident that he has eliminated potential rivals in the elite and enjoys broad public support after cracking down on corruption. But he is worried that a crisis such as an economic slump or a war over North Korea could weaken his authority, they said.
Even with victory in sight, Mr. Xi appears wary of a potential public backlash. Online commentary on ending the term limit has been heavily censored.
After the official Xinhua news agency first announced the proposal on Twitter, which is blocked in China, the journalist who issued the bulletin in English was punished. A colleague, speaking on condition of anonymity, said officials apparently thought it was too bluntly worded.
Critics said the imperious way in which Mr. Xi scored his constitutional coup was a foretaste of how his power could swell into dangerous hubris. Mr. Xi demolished a political convention that for decades has helped to shield China from the succession struggles that convulsed politics under the earlier leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, they said.
The legislature will go through the motions of debating the constitutional changes, but there is virtually no chance that the handpicked delegates will oppose them in large numbers when they vote.
On Monday, delegates broke into applause twice when a legislative official read out the proposal to end Mr. Xiâs term limit.
âI think we should give Xi 20 years to accomplish the Chinese dream and give us back a strong China,â said Jiao Yun, a congress delegate from northeast China who is chairman of a coal processing company. âThe previous 10-year limit doesnât mesh with Chinaâs long-term development.â

Some Things Are True Even if Trump Believes Them,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049878564?accountid=14586,"One of the hardest things to accept for all of us who want Donald Trump to be a one-term president is the fact that some things are true even if Donald Trump believes them! And one of those things is that we have a real trade problem with China. Imports of Chinese goods alone equal two-thirds of the global U.S. trade deficit today.
But while Trumpâs gut instinct is right, heâs so ignorant about the facts, heâs so easily swayed by the last person he talked to or by ill-considered promises to his base, heâs so weirdly obsessed with protecting âmanlyâ industries like coal, steel and aluminum that affect our allies more than China â and heâs built such a chaotic policymaking process and unilaterally surrendered so much leverage to Beijing â that he canât be relied upon to navigate the China trade issue in our national interest.
For those of us who believe in free trade â and that China and America can both thrive at the same time â but who are convinced that China hasnât been playing fair and donât trust Trump to fix it, this is a critical problem to think through.
So, I sat down with David Autor, the M.I.T. economist whoâs done some of the most compelling research on the impacts of China trade. The first problem he raised has to do with the âshockâ that China delivered to U.S. lower-tech manufacturers in the years right after Beijing joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, when it gained more open access to the U.S. and other world markets.
Autor and his colleagues David Dorn and Gordon Hanson found in a 2016 study that roughly 40 percent of the decline in U.S. manufacturing between 2000 and 2007 was due to a surge in imports from China primarily after it joined the W.T.O. And it led to the sudden loss of about one million factory jobs in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump won all of those states.
This âChina shock,â said Autor, led not only to mass unemployment but also to social disintegration, less marriage, more opioid abuse and more people dropping out of the labor market and requiring government aid. âInternational trade creates diffuse benefits and concentrated costs,â he added. âChinaâs rapid rise, while enormously positive for world welfare, has created identifiable losers in trade-impacted industries and the labor markets in which they are located.â
The second problem has to do with access to Chinaâs market for the goods U.S. companies sell. There, noted Autor, âChina has not only taken our lunch, theyâve opened a restaurant thatâs serving it to their citizens.â
We assumed that China would âreform and openâ after it joined the W.T.O., said James McGregor, a longtime China trade expert. Instead, China âreformed and closed.â So China kept a 25 percent tariff on new cars imported from the U.S. (our tariff is 2.5 percent) and similarly steep tariffs on imported auto parts.
China grew its companies behind a wall of protection, fed them with state funds and, when they were competitive enough, unleashed them on the world, or only then opened up to U.S. competitors, but by then its own companies â as in the case of credit cards â had a vise grip on the market.
Sure, Detroit automakers now make a lot of money assembling and selling cars in China, but itâs with a new Chinese-only auto parts supply chain.
And now, as my colleague in China Keith Bradsher, also an expert on China trade, reports: âChinese and foreign makers are about to start sending huge numbers of fully built cars to the U.S. We are about to see a big increase in the U.S. trade deficit in automotive in the next several years.â
U.S. tech firms, like Apple, that want to offer cloud services to Chinese citizens have to store the data in China on servers operated by a Chinese partner. The U.S. has no such regulation.
As Reuters noted, for companies like Apple, âif they donât accept demands to partner with Chinese companies and store data in China, then they risk losing access to the lucrative Chinese market, despite fears about trade secret theft and the rights of Chinese customers.â
Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted it right when he said that âno US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China, but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US.â American electric vehicle (E.V.) companies operating in China are forced to have a Chinese partner and transfer technology to them.
E.V.s are one of the next great global industries, and China has plans to use its market access rules to control the whole E.V. supply chain, not to mention aerospace, quantum computing and a range of other advanced industries. Good for China. âChina has made many smart, admirable investments in infrastructure and human capital,â added Autor, âbut they are also playing by a set of rules that others would be naÃ¯ve to ignore.â
China, knowing U.S. pressure is coming, has been looking for more U.S. goods to buy, said Bradsher, âbut the U.S. is just not that competitive anymore in a lot of products other than oil, food and aircraft. And China is now in the test-flight stage for mass-producing its own jetliners as well.â
So what would a smart American president do? First, heâd sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord. TPP eliminated as many as 18,000 tariffs on U.S. exports with the most dynamic economies in the Pacific and created a 12-nation trading bloc headed by the U.S. and focused on protecting what we do best â high-value-added manufacturing and intellectual property. Alas, Trump tore it up without reading it â one of the stupidest foreign policy acts ever . We Brexited Asia ! China was not in TPP. It was a coalition built, in part, to pressure Beijing into fairer market access, by our rules. Trump just gave it up for free.
Once a smart president restored participation in TPP, heâd start secret trade talks with the Chinese â no need for anyone to lose face â and tell Beijing: âSince you like your trade rules so much, weâre going to copy them for your companies operating in America: 25 percent tariffs on your cars, and your tech companies that open here have to joint venture and share intellectual property with a U.S. partner â and store all their data on U.S. servers.â
Having a really tough trade negotiation with China on manufacturing and high technology, but doing it in secret, makes sense to me. Starting a public trade war with our allies over aluminum and steel that raises the costs for our manufacturers, that doesnât protect our growth industries and that loses allies that we need to deal with China makes absolutely no sense.
But while all of this is necessary, it is not sufficient to maintain the U.S. publicâs support for free trade, which seems to be declining in both parties now. We needed to be, and still need to be, much more serious, and generous, about creating âwage insuranceâ and community reinvestment policies for people and places whose employers are suddenly wiped out by a trade shock. Because this one wonât be the last.
At the same time, we need to be much more serious about using every tool we have â tax incentives, Pell grants, community colleges â to create the conditions for every American to be constantly upgrading skills and for every company to keep training its workers. That will matter whether the challenge is China or robots.
Too much of the economic discussion of late âhas been focused on the 1 percent versus the 99 percent,â observed Autor. âItâs become a kind of âinequality pornâ â where you get so focused on those two numbers that it becomes demobilizing. You lose sight of the fact that there is a dramatic rise in the economic return to tangibly acquiring skills â skills that are available and should be within everyoneâs reach.â
The lack of real meritocracy in our country today, he added, âis not about the returns to realized skills. It is about the inequality in the ability to acquire those skills. Too many people live in areas where they cannot get them. If you get educated in America today, and have a good work ethic, you are going to be rewarded. What does education do? It gives you a skill set and enables you to adapt to change better. And cities and towns anchored by universities tend to reinvent themselves more easily; theyâre engines of adaptation. So higher education benefits not just college students but college places.â
In short, if you want to get rid of walls and ceilings â and I do â you have to strengthen the floors under every American.

Chinaâs Economy Is Not Normal. It Doesnât Have to Be.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2049879019?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â Chinaâs extraordinary growth over the past few decades has spawned two major lines of analysis. One school of thought holds that China is a rising economic power poised to conquer the world. The other argues that Chinaâs economy has become so distorted that it is bound to collapse or, at least, as a former United States Treasury secretary suggested, âregress to the mean.â
Both views are mistaken.
For one thing, China has never been a normal economy. It experienced an average of nearly 10 percent growth rates for almost four decades, a record; it is the first developing nation to become a great power. So why couldnât it keep defying expectations?
What some take to be the Chinese economyâs weaknesses have, in fact, been strengths. Unbalanced growth isnât evidence of a looming risk so much as a sign of successful industrialization. Surging debt levels are a marker of financial deepening rather than profligate spending. Corruption has spurred, not stalled, growth.
At least so far. The central question isnât whether China might continue to confound norms so much as what, precisely, is required for it to do so. And that, as ever, hinges on whether the Chinese government can strike the right balance between state intervention and market forces.
Centralized authoritarian power has its benefits, including the ability for those who have it, at least in theory, to correct course rapidly. This has allowed Chinaâs leaders to put the economy on a more sustainable growth path in recent years. The gross domestic product growth rate rebounded last year. Foreign reserves are back up as well. Wages have increased. The recent abolition of term limits for the president and vice-presidentâs terms gives President Xi Jinping more time and leeway to promote his vision of a more prosperous, modern and powerful China, and with the help of trusted advisers: His former corruption czar, Wang Qishan, is expected to be named vice-president and Liu He vice-premier in charge of the economy.
Skeptics about Chinaâs future usually point to the countryâs swelling debt. Chinaâs overall debt-to-G.D.P. ratio exceeds 250 percent â but that is a fairly average level: higher than that of most emerging-market economies; lower than that of most high-income countries. More worrisome, though, is the fact that it increased by more than 100 percentage points, or nearly doubled, over the past decade.
The International Monetary Fund has cautioned that other economies that experienced such rapidly rising debt ratios â Brazil and South Korea a few decades ago, and several European countries more recently â eventually succumbed to a financial crisis. Why would China be any different?
One reason is that not all debt is created equal.
As some of the optimists note, Chinaâs debt is public, not private, which means that the risks are largely borne by the state, which has deeper pockets. The borrowing is largely domestic, rather than external. And despite a surge in mortgages, Chinese households have a low overall debt burden compared to their counterparts elsewhere. For all its heady growth, Chinaâs financial system also remains relatively simple, without the exotic securitization that nearly brought down the American economy a decade ago.
Chinaâs debt ratio also seems more worrisome than it really is because its nature is often misunderstood.
Chinaâs banks are no longer just serving state actors; now they also serve the private sector, notably after the privatization of state-owned housing in the late 1990s and early 2000s created a broad-based commercial property market. As much as two-thirds of credit expansion between 2005 and 2013 â including via unofficial or so-called shadow banking â went into property-related assets, helping establish a market price for land. Thus, rapid credit growth largely reflects an increasing financial sophistication rather than a property bubble or wasteful investments.
Still, the official figures can appear to suggest otherwise. By my calculations, property prices in China have grown sixfold since 2004. But property transactions are not included in gross domestic product assessments â which helps explain why debt levels have surged while G.D.P. has not.
That said, high debt levels do represent some fundamental weaknesses. As I detail in my last book, the tax revenues of local governments have not kept pace with their social expenditures, prompting those authorities to borrow from banks to fund public services. Chinaâs large debt isnât a debt problem so much as a fiscal problem in disguise.
The growing commercial role of local governments has, in turn, multiplied opportunities for graft. But this problem, too, is often misunderstood.
Corruption is said to impede growth by inhibiting investment. Not so in China, where the state controls major resources, such as land and energy, yet generates lower returns on assets than the private sector does. Privatizing those resources was a nonstarter under communism, and so corruption has served as a makeshift alternative, by allowing more private actors to use state-owned resources after striking arrangements with officials. Because those actorsâ practices are more profitable, the economy has benefited overall.
Some China observers also are concerned that Chinaâs speedy growth cannot be sustained unless consumption replaces investment as the economyâs main driver. (The Chinese government appears to agree, or claims to at least.) They point out that while investment accounts for an unusually high share of gross domestic product, consumption accounts for an unusually low share.
But to say this is to misunderstand the nature of Chinaâs unbalanced growth .
The main cause of that imbalance is urbanization. Over the past four decades Chinaâs urbanization ratio has increased from less than 20 percent to nearly 60 percent. In the process, workers from labor-intensive rural activities have moved to more capital-intensive industrial jobs in cities. And so, yes, an ever-greater share of national income has gone into investment as a result. But corporate profits have also risen, leading to higher wages, which have spurred consumption. In fact, even as the consumption share of G.D.P. has fallen, personal consumption has grown multiples faster in China than in any other major economy.
Eventually, Chinaâs economy will have to become more balanced, as the government well knows. But the Chinese Communist Partyâs plan for that is to have the state play the âleadingâ role in the economy while the market plays the âdecisiveâ role in allocating resources. Squaring that circle can be tricky.
How will Chinaâs leaders reform state-owned enterprises, whose profitability keeps declining (especially relative to that of private firms), when they still see those companies as national champions?
Mass urbanization is expected to continue, still not out of peopleâs personal preferences but at the stateâs behest, by way of residency restrictions, evictions and forced relocations. Yet Chinaâs planners now seem intent on redirecting migrants from megacities to smaller cities, and this could curb economic growth: As the World Bank points out, labor productivity is much higher in larger cities than in smaller ones.
Then, there is the corruption issue, which will require another delicate balancing act. Corruption has benefited the Chinese economy by, in effect, allowing the transfer of state assets to more efficient private actors. But over time such gains are being outweighed by the social costs of bribes, wasteful expenditures and growing inequities. Allowing corruption to run rampant could undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. Yet combating it with draconian measures could hurt growth by discouraging both officials and entrepreneurs from taking economic risks.
Hence the importance, and sensitivity, of Mr. Xiâs signature anticorruption campaign. It has been cast as an effort to discipline errant officials, but some see it as a means for Mr. Xi to purge political opponents or exert more control over society. It seems to have been popular so far: The general public perceives local officials as taking advantage of the system, and here is the central government appearing to rectify the situation. But some warn that the National Supervision Commission, a new agency designed to institutionalize anti-graft efforts, could signal overreach.
To discourage corruption effectively, the Chinese government will eventually have to leaven the rule of the party with more rule of law. In the meantime, some practical reforms would help, including creating a civil code to define acceptable commercial practices, basic property rights and the status of private companies. More sweeping â and more politically sensitive â reforms will also be needed to ensure that private actors have more access to major resources, like land and financing, without having to rely on personal connections to local officials.
The Chinese economyâs glory days may be over, but even a 6 percent growth rate over the next decade would be remarkable. At that pace, the economy would double by 2030 and likely become the worldâs largest in nominal dollar terms. (It already is the worldâs largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity.)
Chinaâs remarkable success to date can be credited in part to its leadersâ willingness to set aside communism for pragmatism. Some observers worry that Mr. Xi is now reinjecting ideology into major policies, Mao-style. But he also is concentrating power and promoting action-oriented reformers like Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu â signaling his intention to address Chinaâs social and economic needs even as he gathers the means to do so. China may not become a normal country for some time yet.

Trump Readies Sweeping Tariffs and Investment Restrictions on China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2047964094?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â The dust has yet to settle on President Trumpâs decision to impose sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, but the White House is preparing another major trade measure, this time aimed squarely at China.
Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers are readying a raft of actions to penalize Chinaâs theft of American intellectual property, including tariffs on at least $30 billion of annual Chinese imports, people familiar with the discussions said.
The measures, which could be announced as early as next week, may also include investment restrictions, caps on visas for Chinese researchers and challenges to Chinaâs trade practices at the World Trade Organization. Those familiar with the planning cautioned that the timing could be delayed, and that such measures are likely to be introduced in stages.
The rapid pace of White House trade measures is no accident and comes at the presidentâs request. At a White House meeting last week, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, presented Mr. Trump with a plan to target $30 billion a year in Chinese imports.
That amount is equal to the cost that Mr. Lighthizerâs office estimates Chinese policies aimed at acquiring American technology impose on American companies annually. In August, Mr. Lighthizer officially began an investigation into those practices, which include digital warfare as well as requiring companies to hand over trade secrets and form joint ventures with Chinese partners to gain access to certain markets.
Mr. Trump â surrounded by his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, his trade adviser Peter Navarro and others â asked for a figure beyond $30 billion and for the plan to be officially announced in the coming weeks, according to two people familiar with the exchange.
The administration is devising the measure to broadly counter a Chinese strategy known as the Made in China 2025 plan. China introduced a comprehensive initiative in 2015 to upgrade Chinese industry over the next decade and dominate sectors of the future, including advanced information technology, new energy vehicles and aerospace equipment.
Unlike the steel and aluminum measure, which divided the presidentâs advisers and his own party, the idea of targeting China has broad support among a number of officials who believe China is cheating in global trade.
Gary D. Cohn, a top economic adviser who resigned over the steel and aluminum tariffs, had approved of action against China, the people familiar with the discussions said. Orrin G. Hatch, the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Republicans who criticized those tariffs, have also endorsed a tough approach toward China.
Congress is also weighing legislation that would strengthen national security checks on Chinese investment. In a House hearing on Thursday, Heath P. Tarbert, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department, said the current system for assessing investment is riddled with loopholes that allowed Chinese companies to evade such checks.
Concern over Chinaâs practices picked up speed at the end of the Obama administration and has only increased since. Last year, a technology-focused unit in the Defense Department issued a report arguing that rising Chinese investment in Silicon Valley was giving China unprecedented access to the military technologies of the future, and increasing Chinese ownership of supply chains that service the United States military.
In recent months, Chinaâs political apparatus has exerted even greater control over the nationâs economy. Business leaders and politicians of both parties now widely say that Washingtonâs past strategy of offering Beijing economic incentives to liberalize its market has failed. On Sunday, China officially ended term limits on the presidency, clearing the way for President Xi Jinping to stay in power indefinitely.
Administration officials say that past failure to rein in China warrants a much tougher approach. Mr. Trump took one step toward this in his national security strategy, which identified China as an economic aggressor. When a top Chinese economic envoy visited in late February, the administration asked China to shave $100 billion off its $375.2 billion trade surplus with the United States, two people close to the talks said. And while the steel and aluminum tariffs will hit many countries, they are primarily aimed at combating overcapacity in Chinese metals, including those that are routed through other nations.
The next step, advisers say, is to more aggressively focus on trade with China.
The United States is expected to impose tariffs on Chinese imports of high-technology goods specified in the Made in China 2025 plan, including semiconductors and new energy vehicles. But they could go beyond that to target more mundane products, including consumer electronics, apparel and even shoes. The breadth of the tariffs remains a contentious topic in the business sector and the White House, with some industries fretting about retaliation and increased costs to American companies and consumers.
Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that while the administration was right to focus on Chinaâs unfair trade practices, his group strongly disagreed with sweeping tariffs.
âSimply put, tariffs are damaging taxes on American consumers,â he said. âTariffs of $30 billion a year would wipe out over a third of the savings American families received from the doubling of the standard deduction in tax reform.â
Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that tariffs on apparel, shoes and electronics would hit American families most. âIs the best response to make American consumers pay for Chinaâs violations? We donât think so,â she said.
Although there is wide support for taking action against unfair trade practices by China, business groups and economists still say the measure could be risky. The United States and China maintain the worldâs largest trading relationship, and the tariffs could easily provoke a backlash.
âThey know our system inside out,â said Jim McGregor, the chairman of the greater China region for APCO Worldwide. He added, referring to the House speaker and the Senate majority leader: âThey know what companies are important to Paul Ryan. They know what companies are important to Mitch McConnell. They know which trade associations and political groups have a big voice in Washington.â
Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while China deserved a tough response, he feared the consequences of the administrationâs actions had not been well considered. âYou really have to be smart,â he said. âThe Chinese arenât just going to fold over on this.â
Mr. Kennedy compared China to a bully that had stolen Americaâs lunch money. ""You want to teach them a lesson,â he said. âBut itâs not as simple as going up in the playground and punching them on the nose.â

The Trade Issue That Most Divides U.S. and China Isnât Tariffs,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2047961117?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â China has struck a hard stance on the issue at the root of the looming trade fight between Beijing and Washington: Chinaâs government-led drive, which Washington describes as breaking international rules, to build the cutting-edge industries of the future.
Chinese officials in recent days have been defending the governmentâs ambitious plan, known as Made in China 2025, to create globally competitive players in industries like advanced microchips, driverless cars and robotics. While Beijing has signaled a willingness to compromise on other matters, the intractable standoff over its core industrial policy could prolong a trade fight that has already shaken markets and led to concerns about a full-blown trade war.
âWe are three years into the implementation of Made in China 2025, and we will keep going,â Miao Wei, Chinaâs minister of industry and information technology, said on Monday, the last day of a three-day economic policy forum in the Chinese capital.
The Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs on imports involving many of the industries being developed under the Made in China 2025 program. Administration officials strongly object to the programâs goal of having Chinese companies dominate these advanced industries, particularly in the Chinese market.
Washington has also protested that companies in the targeted industries have been offered loans at low interest rates by state-controlled Chinese banks. The White House argues that will result in global capacity gluts that could drive down prices and destroy the viability of tech companies in the West, as well as in countries, like Japan and South Korea, that are allied with the United States.
âChina has engaged for a very long time in the theft of our intellectual property as well as practices like forced technology transfer,â Peter Navarro, President Trumpâs trade adviser, said on CNBC on Monday. âWeâre hopeful that China will basically work with us to address some of these practices.â
Mr. Navarro on Monday tried to calm financial markets, which were rattled last week by the prospect of a trade war. He emphasized that âgrowth and stabilityâ were the aim of Mr. Trumpâs policy goal of ensuring that trade with the United States is fair and reciprocal.
Investorsâ fears of a trade war seemed to subside some on Monday. The Standard & Poorâs 500-stock index climbed 2.7 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq composite jumped 3.3 percent.
Whether an agreement that forestalls a protracted economic conflict can be reached remains unclear. The two nations, whose markets are highly integrated, have engaged in discussions for years with little to show as a result. Talks between the United States and China stalled last summer, and the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue between two countries has produced little progress.
The Trump administration has largely shunned the highly structured discussions of past administrations, which were used to try to reach agreement on economic and security issues. The White House now views those channels as producing largely hollow promises by the Chinese and has shifted toward engaging directly with senior-level Chinese counterparts.
On Saturday, just two days after the administration announced tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, called Liu He, Chinaâs economic czar, to congratulate him on his new role of vice premier. The two discussed the trade tensions, including reducing tariffs on American cars and opening up Chinaâs financial services sector to American firms.
âThey also discussed the trade deficit between our two countries and committed to continuing the dialogue to find a mutually agreeable way to reduce it,â a Treasury spokeswoman said.
Chinaâs official news agency, Xinhua, characterized the call between Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Liu as confrontational, with Mr. Liu warning Mr. Mnuchin that Americaâs trade actions against China were straining economic ties between the countries.
Chinese leaders contend that their countryâs economy is still developing. They openly reject Mr. Trumpâs call for reciprocity in trade relations. They have instead offered concessions like raising caps on foreign investorsâ stakes in Chinese financial institutions, and proposed eliminating import tariffs in narrow categories like drugs to treat cancer.
Beijing says that opening up some services sectors would improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy as well as make money for foreign companies. Improving health care, particularly for the aging, has also become a national priority.
But Chinese officials argue that their country is still dangerously reliant on smokestack industries of the past, like steel, aluminum and cheap manufacturing. The average Chinese household lives on a quarter of the income that American and Western European households do, and standards of living remain very low in rural parts of the country, and across central and western China.
Wang Shouwen, Chinaâs vice minister of commerce, and Pascal Lamy, a former director general of the World Trade Organization, squared off at the Beijing forum over precisely that issue.
Mr. Wang insisted that China had made considerable strides in opening up its health, agriculture and shipping sectors to international competition. He noted that the United States and the European Union had higher tariffs than China on some imports of shirts and dairy products. He argued that China meets its W.T.O. obligations; the W.T.O. has long allowed developing countries to have higher tariffs to protect certain industries from international competition.
Mr. Lamy, a longtime critic of protectionism and government intervention, dismissed those arguments. China â which has the worldâs second-largest economy, after the United States, and is the worldâs largest manufacturer by far, of everything from steel and cement to laptop computers â had made too much progress to be lumped in with poor countries, he said.
âPretending it is like India, or like Senegal, or like Botswana is pushing the envelope too far,â Mr. Lamy said. He added that China still had to do more to âensure a level playing field between Chinese producers and foreign producers, whether they produce inside China or outside of China.â
On crucial issues, China and the United States appear to be talking past each other, not even agreeing on what is being debated.
Take semiconductors, for example: China is a major customer for microchips, which are used to power computers, smartphones and an ever-widening array of other electronics. Chips from the United States account for just 4 percent of Chinaâs $260 billion in annual chip imports. While Chinese trade officials have been willing to discuss buying more chips from factories in the United States, that could take market share from Japan and South Korea. Washington has resisted that solution.
American officials say the problem is that Chinaâs national, provincial and municipal governments are working with state-owned banks to rush the construction of factories, particularly to make memory chips.
The new factories often rely on technology that foreign companies have had to transfer as a condition of competing in the Chinese market, according to the United States. Global trade rules ban mandatory technology transfers.
Numerous factories are nearing completion, which will unleash an avalanche of additional output. China contends that it has assisted the sector partly to upgrade its economy and partly because the factories will mainly be supplying its domestic market.
But since factories in China are the worldâs main assemblers of electronics, the countryâs drive for self-sufficiency in microchips could pose a threat to chip producers in the rest of the world.
For now, China seems to be pinning its hopes on heavy lobbying in Washington by Wall Street, traditionally Beijingâs most reliable ally in bilateral disputes. Chinaâs sovereign wealth fund owns stakes in a variety of American financial institutions. Estimates of Chinese outbound investment over the next decade run as high as $2.5 trillion, a rich source of advisory fees in the United States.
Mr. Wang said on Sunday that China might go beyond its earlier offer to raise caps on foreign ownership in Chinese financial institutions. âIt is even possible we will remove those caps altogetherâ in some categories, he said.
But he also made clear that China would not be intimidated if its offers are not enough to satisfy the Trump administration, which has focused on reviving American manufacturing.
âIf Chinaâs interests are impaired,â he said, âwe will have to take measures.â

âPretending it is like India, or like Senegal, or like Botswana is pushing the envelope too far,â Mr. Lamy said. He added that China still had to do more to âensure a level playing field between Chinese producers and foreign producers, whether they produce inside China or outside of China.â
On crucial issues, China and the United States appear to be talking past each other, not even agreeing on what is being debated.
Take semiconductors, for example: China is a major customer for microchips, which are used to power computers, smartphones and an ever-widening array of other electronics. Chips from the United States account for just 4 percent of Chinaâs $260 billion in annual chip imports. While Chinese trade officials have been willing to discuss buying more chips from factories in the United States, that could take market share from Japan and South Korea. Washington has resisted that solution.
American officials say the problem is that Chinaâs national, provincial and municipal governments are working with state-owned banks to rush the construction of factories, particularly to make memory chips.
The new factories often rely on technology that foreign companies have had to transfer as a condition of competing in the Chinese market, according to the United States. Global trade rules ban mandatory technology transfers.
Numerous factories are nearing completion, which will unleash an avalanche of additional output. China contends that it has assisted the sector partly to upgrade its economy and partly because the factories will mainly be supplying its domestic market.
But since factories in China are the worldâs main assemblers of electronics, the countryâs drive for self-sufficiency in microchips could pose a threat to chip producers in the rest of the world.
For now, China seems to be pinning its hopes on heavy lobbying in Washington by Wall Street, traditionally Beijingâs most reliable ally in bilateral disputes. Chinaâs sovereign wealth fund owns stakes in a variety of American financial institutions. Estimates of Chinese outbound investment over the next decade run as high as $2.5 trillion, a rich source of advisory fees in the United States.
Mr. Wang said on Sunday that China might go beyond its earlier offer to raise caps on foreign ownership in Chinese financial institutions. âIt is even possible we will remove those caps altogetherâ in some categories, he said.
But he also made clear that China would not be intimidated if its offers are not enough to satisfy the Trump administration, which has focused on reviving American manufacturing.
âIf Chinaâs interests are impaired,â he said, âwe will have to take measures.â

Why China Is Confident It Can Beat Trump in a Trade War,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2022298888?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Chinaâs leaders sound supremely confident that they can win a trade war with President Trump.
The state news media has depicted him as a reckless bully intent on undermining the global trading system, while presenting the Chinese government as a fair-minded champion of free trade. And Chinaâs leader, Xi Jinping, has used the standoff to reinforce the Communist Partyâs message that the United States is determined to stop Chinaâs rise â but that it no longer can. China is already too strong, its economy too big.
âChina is not afraid of a trade war,â the vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, declared at a news conference to discuss possible countermeasures. More than once, he cited the history of the ânew Chinaâ â which began its extraordinary economic revival four decades ago â as evidence that it would ânever succumb to external pressure.â
Missing in the bluster and the propaganda are the questionable methods that China has adopted to squeeze foreign companies out of key technology markets â and the fact that in the cold-eyed calculus of economics, China is more vulnerable to a trade war than officials admit.
Exports account for a big share of Chinese economic growth. Because the United States buys so much from China, Washington has many more ways to hit Chinese manufacturers. By contrast, the retaliatory tariffs Beijing has proposed already cover more than one-third of what China buys from the United States, leaving it fewer options to strike back.
In the political realm, however, Mr. Xi enjoys advantages that may allow him to cope with the economic fallout far better than Mr. Trump can. His authoritarian grip on the news media and the party means there is little room for criticism of his policies, even as Mr. Trump must contend with complaints from American companies and consumers before important midterm elections in November.
The Chinese government also has much greater control over the economy, allowing it to shield the public from job cuts or factory closings by ordering banks to support industries suffering from American tariffs. It can spread the pain of a trade war while tolerating years of losses from state-run companies that dominate major sectors of the economy.
âMy impression is that there is in Washington an exaggerated sense of how painful these tariffs might beâ in China, said Arthur R. Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm in Beijing.
At worst, he estimated, the American actions could shave one-tenth of a percentage point off Chinaâs economic growth â hardly enough to force a drastic reversal of policies, given the enormous benefits that Chinese leaders see in the state-heavy economic model they have relied on in recent decades.
At the same time, Chinese officials seem to believe they can take advantage of what they consider vulnerabilities in the American political system.
âThe American agricultural sector is quite influential in the Congress,â said Wang Yong, a professor of economics at Peking University, explaining why China has targeted farm products such as soybeans with possible retaliatory tariffs. âChina wants the American domestic political system to do the work.â
The president and his administration have sent drastically different messages this week.
Hours after Chinaâs announcement on Wednesday, administration officials sought to calm fears that a trade war was imminent, suggesting that they might not pull the trigger on a plan to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods.
But late Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would consider levying an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods in response to its âunfair retaliation.â In a statement, he said, âRather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers.â
Mr. Zhu, Chinaâs vice minister of finance, this week had thanked American soybean farmers and the association that represents them for declaring their opposition to the Trump administrationâs plan.
In addition to soybeans, China threatened to retaliate with tariffs on American cars, chemicals and other products. The 106 goods, many produced in parts of the country that have supported Mr. Trump, were selected to deliver a warning that American workers and consumers would suffer in a protracted standoff.
âIf anyone wants to fight, we will be there with him,â Mr. Zhu said, more or less outlining the terms for an American surrender: the removal of unilateral tariffs and a resolution of any grievances through the World Trade Organization. âIf he wants to negotiate, the door is open.â
Globally, Chinaâs strategy has been to isolate the United States, splitting it from allies in Europe and Asia who otherwise share American concerns about heavy-handed Chinese trade policies intended to protect key markets and to acquire technology from foreign firms.
Mr. Kroeber said a united front against China would be more effective than American tariffs alone, but so far Mr. Trump has not managed to build one.
Instead, Mr. Xi has largely succeeded in occupying the high moral ground on the world stage, projecting China as the sober-minded steward of international agreements on issues â from global trade to climate change â that Mr. Trump has been eager to walk away from.
âThe American side is ready to launch a trade war at the slightest pretext,â the partyâs flagship newspaper, Peopleâs Daily, wrote in a blistering editorial on Thursday, condemning Mr. Trumpâs tariffs as âtotally against the trend of economic globalization.â
âToday, it targets China, and tomorrow may take aim at other countries,â it said.
The party has also seized on the trade dispute as new evidence that the United States is intent on undermining Chinaâs rise as a global power, a central narrative used to justify the partyâs, and Mr. Xiâs, rule.
In December, the state news media also highlighted the new National Security Strategy unveiled by the Trump administration, which declared that China âsought to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, expand the reaches of its state-driven economic model, and reorder the region in its favor.â
The document signaled a bipartisan shift in Washingtonâs posture toward China after decades of economic cooperation and concessions. The party has argued that the United States is only now challenging China because it fears losing its privileged place in the world order.
âThe latest U.S. measures against China carry a sense of containment, which purportedly is commonplace among U.S. politicians,â said an editorial in Global Times, a nationalist state-run tabloid. âBut they have overlooked the fact that China has grown to be another economic center of the world.â
It went on to note that Chinaâs market was now âno smaller or less attractiveâ than the American one â a bit of an exaggeration perhaps, but not as big as it would have been a decade ago. And that makes the country a more formidable opponent than Mr. Trump may have anticipated.
âTo take China down,â the editorial said, âwould mean an unimaginably cruel battle for the U.S.â

"U.S. and China Play Chicken on Trade, and Neither Swerves","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2022882676?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI â At the heart of the intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China is a fundamental question: Which country is more willing to endure short-term pain for the long-term gain of playing a leading role in high-tech industries.
China has embarked on an aggressive and expensive plan to retool its economy for the future as it moves to dominate in robotics, aerospace, artificial intelligence and more. President Trump has said Chinaâs approach relies on unfair and predatory practices, and on stolen American technology. And even as Chinese leaders say they want to avoid a trade war, they are staunchly defending their plans and showing little sign of backing down.
Mr. Trumpâs threat to sharply escalate the administrationâs tariffs on Chinese imports â a threat he reiterated on Friday â shows that neither side has yet gone far enough to persuade the other to compromise. Bigger and broader tariffs may be necessary to get Chinaâs attention.
âThe administration, if itâs serious, better be prepared for much more,â said Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
Chinaâs $300 billion plan for government assistance, Made in China 2025, calls for helping cutting-edge industries by providing low-interest loans from state-controlled banks, guaranteeing large market shares in China and offering extensive research subsidies. The goal is to help Chinese firms acquire Western competitors, develop advanced technology and construct immense factories with considerable economies of scale.
It is an agenda that China would probably go to great lengths to protect. âWe will not start a war â however, if someone starts a war, we will definitely fight back,â Gao Feng, the commerce ministry spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing on Friday. âNo options will be ruled out.â
For the United States, victory in such a war would be difficult to verify, much less achieve.
China could say it plans to ease back on government support. But that could be difficult to quantify because of the countryâs opaque political system and the stateâs control of information.
China could back off from rules that favor local competitors and require American companies to share technology if they want access to the Chinese market. For example, foreign automakers face pressure to transfer electric-car technology to their local partners, and foreign technology companies are increasingly required to submit to security reviews. Foreign businesses have long complained that many of the rules they must follow are unwritten.
Chinaâs government-financed campaign is already paying off in some ways. Drive into downtown Shanghai from Pudong International Airport and you pass a seemingly endless series of huge hangars and vast, glass-walled design centers, all part of the countryâs effort to create a commercial aircraft manufacturing giant to rival Boeing or Airbus. Travel to factory districts in Shanghai and on the outskirts of many other Chinese cities and you see enormous, newly built factories ready to churn out electric cars, the batteries they use and other components.
Proving that the Chinese government unfairly supports the effort could be difficult, however.
The United States could press its argument with the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trading rules and prohibits big loans from government-controlled banks at artificially low interest rates. But the W.T.O. requires many contracts and government documents to prove cases, evidence that can be hard to get in a tightly controlled country like China.
Even when the W.T.O. rules against China, persuading the country to comply can be challenging. One such ruling, involving Chinaâs restrictions on foreign electronic payment systems, was issued nearly six years ago. China is still mulling how it will comply â despite numerous complaints from the Obama administration and more recent nudges from the Trump administration.
So the United States has turned to tariffs. That means it is using a 1980s tool to address an industrial policy issue that is already shaping the 21st century.
Mr. Trumpâs top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, was a deputy United States trade representative under President Ronald Reagan. The tariffs that Mr. Lighthizer threatened against Japan in those days are among the same ones he is wielding now. But the two periods differ in two big ways.
One is that Japan depended on the United States in the â80s for military protection from the Soviet Union. China, by contrast, is an increasingly assertive global rival, sending naval vessels to the Baltic Sea and building a naval base in East Africa.
The second major difference between then and now is that the European Union deeply resented the tariffs of the 1980s, and Mr. Trumpâs use of them could make it difficult to persuade European officials to present a united front. In response to American tariffs, Beijing could simply shift business from American companies like Boeing and Ford to European rivals like Airbus and Daimler.
Chinese officials dispute the American accusations about their unfair trade practices. They say Mr. Trumpâs tariffs violate W.T.O. rules, and they dispute claims that China forces American companies to hand over technology. As for Made in China 2025, Chinese officials say the plan is only guidance, not a government directive â and that foreign companies are free to participate, too.
In Chinaâs current industrial policy, the Trump administration sees an extension of how the country has already come to dominate one major industry of the future: solar power.
Mr. Trump himself is no fan of solar panels. He has spoken enthusiastically about coal, not renewable energy, throughout his campaign and his presidency. But the solar power industry is one of the biggest success stories so far in Chinaâs efforts involving advanced industries.
The United States played a central role in developing solar panels and manufacturing them until a decade ago. Around then, the Chinese government decided to finance a lavish expansion of the sector. State-controlled banks lent tens of billions of dollars at low interest rates despite the high-profile bankruptcies of solar manufacturers.
Chinese firms now produce three-quarters of the worldâs solar panels. Most American and European companies have closed factories, and many have become insolvent. Chinaâs success in producing solar panels has given Beijing a blueprint for seizing the lead in a long list of other high-tech industries.
Many foreign companies are caught between Chinaâs industrial ambitions and Washingtonâs efforts to stop them, including major aerospace companies and carmakers. The conflict may spread: Made in China 2025 could create major competitors to General Electric and Intel, and to companies outside the United States like Siemens and Samsung.
Tariffs could hurt such companies if the United States and China follow through on their plans. They also risk losing their competitiveness if Beijing succeeds in subsidizing the creation of large Chinese rivals in their industries.
Boeing, for example, could be hit by American tariffs on civilian aircraft parts it buys from Avic, a state-controlled Chinese military and aviation company â required purchases if the company, which is based in Chicago, wants to sell planes in China. China, in turn, is pushing a consortium that includes Avic to become a Boeing rival. Boeing, like other multinational companies, has refrained from endorsing or criticizing the tariffs.
âAlthough our members are unhappy with retaliatory tariffs being used,â said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, âthere is a belief that greater pressure has to be brought to bear on China.â

"Xi Jinping Urges Dialogue, Not Confrontation, After Trump Seeks Tariffs","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2023467889?accountid=14586,"BOAO, China â President Xi Jinping on Tuesday portrayed China as committed to opening its economy as he presented an alternative vision to President Trumpâs calls for tariffs and restricting trade, urging âdialogue rather than confrontation.â
Speaking publicly for the first time since the beginning of an escalating trade dispute between his country and the United States, Mr. Xi implicitly took aim at the Trump administration.
âThe Cold War mentality and zero-sum game are increasingly obsolete,â Mr. Xi said. âOnly by adhering to peaceful development and working together can we truly achieve win-win results.â
Mr. Xi also pledged to rebuff efforts to impose barriers to world trade, saying that âChinaâs door of opening up will not be closed and will only open up even wider.â
[ READ MORE: Why President Trumpâs trade clash with China may get worse before it gets better.]
Mr. Xi highlighted areas where China was willing to give, including pledging to ease restrictions on imported cars by the end of the year as well as repeating open-ended promises to give foreigners greater access to the countryâs financial markets â promises officials have made in the past. He also pledged to strengthen intellectual property rights, addressing one of Mr. Trumpâs main complaints.
His comments struck a tonal contrast with the more combative language coming from Mr. Trump and his administration.
âWe should respect each otherâs core interest and major concerns and follow a new approach to state-to-state relations, featuring dialogue rather than confrontation,â Mr. Xi said. âWe live in a time with an overwhelming trend toward openness and connectivity.â
The speech, delivered at the Boao Forum for Asia in Chinaâs southern island province of Hainan, was the Chinese governmentâs latest effort to position the country as an advocate of free trade and reliable growth. The pro-trade sentiments buoyed markets worldwide, with the Standard & Poorâs 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average both up by more than 1 percent in midday trading on Tuesday.
But Mr. Xiâs pitch runs counter to longstanding accusations that China violates trade rules and intellectual property rights. The Chinese president is also pushing a nationalistic agenda, as he tightens his grip on the countryâs political, social and economic life.
Some were skeptical that China would follow through on its pledges of openness. âPeople will say about the Boao speech: âShow me.â We heard this in Davos last year,â Joerg Wuttke, former president of the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, said in referring to Mr. Xiâs 2017 speech at the World Economic Forum.
But in a time when the United Statesâ policies have threatened to upset the stability of the world order, Chinaâs growing confidence and its verbal support of global trade rules offer other countries a potentially appealing alternative to Mr. Trumpâs rhetoric.
Mr. Xi spoke just days after the United States and China exchanged tit-for-tat tariff threats that have ignited worries of a global trade war. Trump administration officials have accused China of forcing foreign companies doing business here to give up trade secrets as part of Beijingâs effort to retool the Chinese economy and create companies that can compete with American rivals.
On trade, China has tried to project a balanced tone. It retaliated quickly last week after the United States detailed proposed tariffs it wanted to levy on about $50 billion in Chinese-made goods, saying it would match Washingtonâs efforts dollar for dollar. At the same time, Chinese officials have said they want to avoid a trade war and negotiate.
On Tuesday, Mr. Xi appeared to have given Mr. Trump a concession by pledging to âsignificantlyâ lower tariffs on imported automobiles by the end of the year. Just hours before, Mr. Trump had taken to Twitter to complain about Chinaâs 25 percent tax on imported automobiles.
But Mr. Xiâs pledges to open Chinaâs banking, auto and manufacturing sectors are not entirely new. Last November, China said it would ease and eventually remove limits on foreign ownership of banks and other financial firms, but financial firms have not received details about when and how that will happen.
Even as trade disputes cast a shadow over the worldâs two biggest economies, Chinese officials see the increasingly strident tone from Washington as an opportunity. Since Mr. Trump was elected in 2016 and pursued an America First policy that has alienated some allies, Mr. Xi and other Chinese leaders have tried to fill the void left by Americaâs declining presence on the world stage.
Mr. Xi traveled to Davos for the first time last year to call for global leadership on climate on the eve of the inauguration of Mr. Trump, who has publicly questioned the science behind climate change. Chinese officials were also front and center at the most recent Davos gathering, in January, where they cited Chinaâs prog r ess and called for more international cooperation on several fronts.
That call for unity could also help calm some unease resulting from Mr. Xiâs recent power grab. Last month, China formally ended term limits for its top leader, which could make Mr. Xi the countryâs chief for life. That move has caused jitters among some in the United States and other countries.
At Boao, Chinese officials have promoted Mr. Xiâs leadership as providing an opening to carry out ambitious plans to overhaul the countryâs economy and make it more open.
On trade, government leaders and Chinese corporate chiefs have sought to strike a delicate balance: playing down worries about the effect on China of a protracted trade fight, while warning that the global economic system could be disrupted by a trade war and that the United States risks falling behind.
âIf a trade conflict becomes a trade war, the U.S. is more likely to be hurt worse by this than China,â Dai Xianglong, a former governor of the Peopleâs Bank of China, said on Monday at the opening of the forum.
Other countries could be hit as well, said Fan Gang, director of Chinaâs National Economic Research Institute. China is just a piece of a complicated regional supply chain across Asia, he said, citing the example of the Apple iPhone. Any retaliation from the United States would have a ripple effect from South Korea to Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan.
âThere is definitely a big uncertainty with this trade conflict. We started with trade friction and now conflict and possibly a war,â Mr. Fan said. âThis trade war has an impact on the whole supply chain, and this is the systematic risk for China right now,â he added.
Many Chinese business executives tried to strike a similar balance in their remarks at Boao. But some warned that the technological focus of Mr. Trumpâs proposed tariffs could further split the American and Chinese technology worlds â and, ultimately, stifle innovation.
âInternational standards come from Germany, America and Japan,â said Dong Mingzhu, the chairwoman of Gree Electric Appliances, a leading Chinese manufacturer. âWe in China donât have any â but I believe we will have international standards.â
Others did warn of the potential economic impact if tensions worsen. On Monday evening, Jack Ma, the billionaire executive chairman of Alibaba, warned that his pledge to create a million jobs in the United States could be threatened by a trade dispute between China and the United States.
âIf China and the U.S. have good relations, we could create not just a million, but 10 million jobs.â
But, he added, âif they donât have good relations, weâre going to destroy 10 million jobs.â

Xi Jinping Promotes Openness at a China Forum Rife With Restrictions,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2024126454?accountid=14586,"BOAO, China â The International Monetary Fund chief praised his openness. A senior British banker lauded his authoritarian rule. The Philippine president said he loves the man.
President Xi Jinping of China took center stage at his countryâs annual Boao Forum for Asia this week to the welcoming arms of many in the global elite. He portrayed himself as a champion of free trade and world order, speaking to a group that included Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary general of the United Nations, and Pascal Lamy, the former director general of the World Trade Organization, and his words helped move markets around the world.
The forum, held every year on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, has long been a platform for China to portray itself as an economic powerhouse and regional leader.
But this yearâs meetings took on an elevated role, as a platform for Beijing, a result of a growing trade dispute between China and the United States. It was an opportunity for Mr. Xi to present himself as a foil to President Trump, who has rejected globalization and focused on an âAmerica First policy,â targeting China, in particular, with a series of protectionist moves.
Plaudits from foreign leaders like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, as well as leading figures of the economic and diplomatic world, have helped to cement this image.
âI congratulate you, Xi Jinping, for this new life that you have identified, for the openness that you have celebrated and advocated,â Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech, âfor the innovation and inclusiveness that you have encouraged.â
Yet even as Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Xi talked about that openness, forum attendees were unable to use Google, log on to Facebook or post to Twitter about the event unless they found a way to bypass Chinaâs army of internet censors. In fact, aspects of the forum stand in stark contrast with the many ways China remains closed and intransigent.
Not only does the country restrict access to the internet, it has ramped up surveillance efforts in recent years. And while Chinese companies increasingly look overseas for new markets, foreign businesses routinely complain that they are unable to freely sell to customers in China.
To some of the more cynical China watchers, there is a sense that the pledges Mr. Xi offered to the forum, and the world, may amount to less than they appear.
While Mr. Xiâs vow at the forum to ease tariffs and open Chinaâs markets cheered investors, it mostly repeated Beijingâs earlier promises. His plan to lower charges on imported cars, an oft-cited complaint of Mr. Trumpâs, came with a new deadline â before the end of the year â but left out crucial details, like by how much they would fall. He promised to improve intellectual property safeguards, another longtime American frustration, as well.
The timing of reducing trade restrictions may not matter. Chinaâs tariffs in the automotive sector, for example, have already been successful in getting foreign companies to shift a large part of their supply chains to China, where they make most of the cars they sell in the country. In this respect, Mr. Xiâs gesture is seen as too little too late. For many years, Chinese officials have said that they would reduce protectionist policies in the automotive industry when they are ready to move into Western markets in order to prevent the possibility of reciprocal tariffs.
There was no chance for political maneuvering at the forum, though, as no American officials were present.
On Wednesday, Chinaâs central bank governor, Yi Gang, also partly fleshed out how China plans to open the countryâs financial services sector to foreign investors.
Mr. Yi did not go into details, but he said that restrictions on foreign insurers and on foreign ownership of securities would be loosened by the end of June. He added that China planned to create a connected stock market between Shanghai and London that would allow investors in either market to invest in the other, despite Chinaâs tight control on the flow of money over its border.
âThere is clearly a lot of room for improvement when it comes to opening up and creating level playing fields between China and the rest of the world,â said Hans-Paul BÃ¼rkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group.
In any case, such criticism was drowned out by a focus on celebrating Mr. Xi, who has progressively strengthened his control over the government and the economy. Just last month, for example, he did away with the term limits that had bound his predecessors for decades.
âChina is wonderful for us in business,â Gerry Grimstone, deputy chairman of the British bank Barclays, told Bloomberg television on the sidelines of the forum. âThe fact that Xi is prepared to give such strong authoritarian guidance within the context of a market economy is great for companies like mine.â
Many of the nearly 2,000 members of the news media â a figure cited by Boao organizers â who came to this sunny island for the three-day conference have dutifully carried similar messages of a strong and responsible China.
Transcripts and state media clips were quickly available for those who missed out on any panels, and social media was overwhelmed with quotes from dignitaries and corporate executives about Chinaâs new position on the global stage.
Mr. Duterte helped to set the tone just before heading to Boao, telling reporters back home: âI need China. More than anybody else at this point, I need China.â
He added: âI simply love Xi Jinping. He understood, he understands my problem and is willing to help, so I would say thank you, China.â
Absent from the panels at Boao was much discussion about how trade tariffs could affect the Chinese economy. Instead, the message was that the United States would be left behind.
âChina will open up more to the whole world, but if America carries on with its protectionist measures, the U.S. will be left out,â said Li Daokui, director of the Center for China in the World Economy at Tsinghua University.
Should Mr. Trump follow through with threatened tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese exports, there would be an impact on the Chinese economy, said Xu Sitao, chief China economist for Deloitte China.
âIn the end, the effect will be some tax on the economy,â Mr. Xu said.
The telecommunications sectors, and specifically telecom equipment, would bear the brunt of the tariff, he added.
If that spurred any concern among Chinaâs technology entrepreneurs, though, few expressed it at the forum. They broadly warned that closing borders would stifle innovation, but did not specify how a trade dispute with the United States could affect their bottom line.
Shen Wei, president and chief executive of Vivo, a Chinese software company, urged companies like his to be more open with their technology. âWe cannot survive without each other,â he said.
Baidu, Chinaâs biggest internet search company, has been a beneficiary of previous attempts by the Chinese government to protect domestic companies. Speaking at the Boao forum, Zhang Yaqin, Baiduâs president, urged the United States to be more open and said that his company had not felt much impact from the growing trade tensions.
âI have not seen a significant influence on our basic work,â Mr. Zhang said.
âI do not want to see this trade dispute escalate,â he added. âBut it will not affect the development of technology.â

"E.U. Likes Trumpâs Stance on China, but Hates His Methods","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2024551553?accountid=14586,"BRUSSELS â Virtually no one in Europe wants President Trump to plunge headlong into a trade war with China. But nearly everyone thinks that it is time to stand up to Chinaâs closed markets and trade manipulation.
The European Union may not like Mr. Trump or the way he is doing things â but that does not mean it dislikes his aims when it comes to trading with China.
But Europe would also like the conflict to go away, fearing the bloc will be caught between the United States, its primary market and second-largest supplier, and China, its primary supplier and second-largest market.
The way to make that happen, it believes, is challenging China through negotiations within the existing trading system, avoiding a degenerative tit-for-tat battle that could harm Europeâs relatively vibrant economy.
âWhen Trump was elected, a lot of Europeans wondered whether there will be a point where we have to decide between the U.S. and China, and it seems that moment may be now,â said Angela Stanzel, a China expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.
âI donât think Europe will side with China â we have the same problems with China as the Americans do,â she said. âBut the E.U. does agree with the Chinese that Trump is doing it the wrong way and has been outspokenly critical about his methods. A trade war between the U.S. and China would really put Europe on the spot.â
So far, Mr. Trump has evaded the usual venue for settling trade disputes â negotiating through the World Trade Organization â by citing national security as a justification for his severe tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Last week, Beijing struck back, threatening an additional $50 billion worth of tariffs on American products, including soybeans, cars and pork. It has asked the European Union â subject to Mr. Trumpâs proposed tariffs but temporarily exempted â to take its side in the dispute.
Beijing has good reason to be concerned about Europe and the United States ganging up against it over trade.
Despite its unhappiness over Mr. Trumpâs methods, Europe is unlikely to side openly with China, given the importance of the trans-Atlantic security relationship and its own arguments with Beijing.
Germany and France, in particular, have been increasingly annoyed by Chinaâs behavior, especially its closed markets and its lack of transparency about investments in Europe.
There has also been growing recognition that China is pursuing its own great-power goals as relentlessly as Mr. Trump wants to do.
âThe Chinese are very, very worried about any kind of trans-Atlantic alliance or even discussions about the rise of China, what itâs doing as an investor or geopolitically,â said Philippe Le Corre, a China expert now at Harvardâs Kennedy School of Government. âChinese officials are always asking about this.â
Europe has become tougher in its view of China, he said, with France, Germany and Italy urging the European Union to start screening investments in sensitive industries and sectors.
China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, Mr. Le Corre said, âand people think itâs time China plays by the rules.â
China has few real allies in the world of trade, he said, and there has rarely been a better opportunity âfor the world to assess the presence of a huge player who is now involved in everything, takes advantage of open markets elsewhere and doesnât really open its own market to the West.â
Mr. Trump campaigned on an economic platform that was anti-globalization, anti-Germany and anti-China. He promised, in particular, to get tough with China to benefit American workers, promising huge and unlikely blanket tariffs and taxes on Chinese imports.
Some action was expected, and now it has come.
But there is still debate in Europe about whether Mr. Trump intends to go through with these tariffs or whether they are part of his theory of negotiation â threaten big, then call even minor concessions a victory. No one is sure.
But Ms. Stanzel and others believe that Chinaâs leader, Xi Jinping, just granted an end to term limits on his job, does not want a trade war that unites the wealthy, technology rich West against him, however reluctantly.
âThe Chinese seem willing to negotiate behind closed doors,â she said, adding that the Chinese and the Europeans were both talking to the Trump administration âabout finding a better way.â
Jyrki Katainen, the European Commissionâs vice president in charge of jobs, growth and competitiveness, described Mr. Trumpâs methods as âunconventional.â But, he added, âthereâs been a lot of words, little implementation, which is good.â
But Europeâs exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs will end on May 1, unless a deal is reached. And both Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump need to look strong and determined.
So there is wariness in Europe, fueled by the strong anti-multilateralist tenor of senior Trump officials and the resignation of Gary D. Cohn, who as Mr. Trumpâs chief economic adviser had seemed a voice of restraint.
Brussels feels vulnerable, said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian ambassador who is now a security consultant based in Brussels.
The European stance so far, he said, is a mix of tactics, strategy and denial.
The tactics are to threaten retaliation against American goods. The strategy is to hedge its bets between Washington and Beijing, in part depending on whether it is exempted from the tariffs. The denial is the less-than-certain hope that negotiations will avoid the worst.
But if the United States âdeclares an all-out war on the W.T.O. and the international free trade system while China becomes its defender,â Mr. Stefanini said, âthe E.U. will inevitably be pushed on to Chinaâs side.â
Neutrality is difficult, he said, âwhen youâre already under attack,â especially given that the binding essence of the European Union is free trade and the global rule-based order.
Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, the Brussels-based economic research institution, argued in a blog post that the European Union needed a response to Mr. Trumpâs challenge to global trade that is not based on âwishful thinking.â
The bloc is right to try to preserve the global trading system and to bring Washington and Beijing to the table, Mr. Wolff said. But Europe will also find itself under pressure if China starts redirecting its steel to Europe, as Russia is likely to do with its aluminum.
âWill lobby pressures become so great that the E.U. will also feel compelled to raise tariffs?â he asked.
Europeâs best response, Mr. Wolff suggested, is to put greater focus on its domestic market in order to reduce its dependence on global trade. Europe should, he said, increase its domestic investment, promote innovation in the new digital economy currently dominated by the United States and China, and spend more on its own defense.
âThis strategy will not be easy,â Mr. Wolff said. But reducing dependency, he added, is the best answer to âthe formidable challenge that President Trump poses for our prosperity and security.â

"Chinaâs Economy Grows, and Its Trade Gap With the U.S. Widens","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2025904921?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI â Chinaâs economy grew at a healthy pace in the first three months of this year, propelled by strong household spending and heavy government investment in infrastructure.
It was also helped â albeit much more modestly â by a factor that could exacerbate the countryâs tense relations with Washington: China is selling a lot more to the United States, and its purchases from America arenât keeping up.
The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing announced Tuesday morning that the economy had expanded 6.8 percent in the first quarter compared with the same quarter last year. That was well ahead of the pace necessary to hit the governmentâs target of 6.5 percent growth for the entire year.
The countryâs quarterly growth figure has become so implaus i bly smooth and predictable in recent years that economists generally look for other ways to gauge Chinaâs economic health.
Data released on Tuesday indicated that growth might have been cooling by the end of the quarter. Industrial production rose 6 percent in March, less than most economists had expected. Urban fixed-asset investment also rose less than expected.
The central bank announced a measure Tuesday evening that would make it easier for commercial banks to keep lending, a move that would tend to support continued economic growth and that could indicate concern on the bankâs part. The central bank, the Peopleâs Bank of China, said that it was reducing by a full percentage point the reserves that commercial banks are required to deposit with it, freeing up more cash for commercial banks to lend to businesses and households.
Another measure experts look to for insight into Chinaâs economy is trade, which at one time was a major driver of Chinese growth. Over the last decade, however, it has been far eclipsed in importance by Chinese investment and household spending.
The latest figures show exports to the United States are growing considerably faster than Chinaâs purchases of American goods. That could provoke more ire from President Trump, who had threatened to impose $150 billion in tariffs on Chinese products.
The trade figures present a mixed picture of how painful those tariffs could be for China. Over all, trade is not as important to Chinaâs economy as it was a decade ago, suggesting the country could better weather a trade fight. But the data also suggests Chinaâs exports to the United States, specifically, have become more valuable to Chinaâs economy as it increasingly makes most â or even all â of the parts that go inside what it sells abroad.
Sizing Up the Surplus
Mr. Trump has focused on Chinaâs trade surplus with the United States, or the difference between what it sells to America and what it buys. And in the first three months of the year, the trade surplus for goods hit a new high of $58 billion, according to Chinese data. Trade in services, in which the United States is stronger, is tiny compared with the trade in goods, and offsets only about a tenth of the deficit in goods.
Chinaâs surplus on goods with the United States last year totaled $375 billion, according to Washington, or $276 billion, according to Beijing. The United States includes Chinese goods shipped by way of Hong Kong, a Chinese city that operates under its own laws, while Beijingâs statistics do not. Either way, Chinaâs surplus has been rising.
Mr. Trump wants Chinaâs annual trade surplus to shrink by $100 billion â a reversal that could lower Chinaâs entire economic output by nearly a full percentage point if the Chinese factories producing those goods simply shut down.
Xing Zhihong, the spokesman for Chinaâs statistics bureau, said on Tuesday that China did not try to have a trade surplus with the rest of the world, and noted that it was narrowing overall. He also dismissed the idea that trade frictions with the United State could stymie growth.
âSino-American trade frictions cannot cause a slowdown in the Chinese economy, nor change the good momentum in Chinaâs economic development,â Mr. Xing said.
Strictly by the numbers, Chinaâs trade surplus with the United States helps Chinese economic growth figures, though the reality of the relationship between the countries is more complex. Many American consumers and companies benefit from Chinese-made goods, and a number of economists doubt that Mr. Trumpâs focus on lowering the trade surplus with a single country will help the United States.
Home Grown
On their face, the numbers suggest that American businesses have become dependent on China. And in fact, Chinaâs trade surplus with the United States is growing even as its surplus with the rest of the world has shrunk.
But something else is going on: China is depending more on itself.
China was once famous for assembling goods made from parts that had been bought elsewhere. A smartphone that is made in China, for example, might have a screen from Japan, memory chips from South Korea and a main processor from the United States. In fact, those parts and components long accounted for a sizable chunk of what China bought from the United States.
Today, China can do all that entirely within its own borders, making everything from advanced electronic components to car parts and assembling the final product.
âIn the last 10 years, youâve seen China become considerably more developed and sophisticated in terms of its own supply chains,â said Gordon Styles, the founder and president of Star Rapid, a company in Zhongshan, China, that does rapid prototypes and low-volume test manufacturing runs for everything from auto parts to medical equipment.
âIt is now easier than it ever was before to produce the entire product here,â he said.
Follow the Chain
Global automakers and other multinational companies have moved much of their supply chains to China to avoid Chinese tariffs, tap the countryâs vast work force and move closer to a big new market.
Brad Setser, a Council on Foreign Relations economist, calculated that imports of manufactured goods from the United States are becoming steadily less important to the Chinese economy. He estimated that China now produces within its borders up to four-fifths of the value of each dollar of exports. That share had been as little as two-thirds in 2011.
Nadim Ahmad, the head of the trade and competitiveness statistics division at the O.E.C.D., said that China has been expanding in areas like research, design and development that had previously been done overseas. âYouâre basically creating a lot more in the economyâ as goods are manufactured, he said.
That means China gets more bang from its buck from its exports to the United States â and suggests American tariffs could be more painful than tradeâs shrinking share of the economy suggests.

Qualcomm May Be Collateral Damage in a U.S.-China Trade War,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2027208956?accountid=14586,"Correction Appended
WASHINGTON â A looming trade war between the United States and China has put Qualcomm, one of Americaâs largest technology companies, squarely in the middle of the battlefield.
A major supplier in both China and the United States, the San Diego-based chip maker has long managed to play the trading relationship between the worldâs two largest economies to its advantage. But an escalating trade battle over which country will dominate the technologies of the future is now threatening Qualcommâs business and its growth.
On Monday, Qualcomm lost the ability to export semiconductors to one of its biggest customers after the United States banned Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corporation from purchasing American technology for seven years.
In China, Qualcommâs plan to acquire NXP Semiconductors, a critical part of its growth strategy, has been stalled by a prolonged antitrust review, a move critics see as Chinese retaliation for President Trumpâs aggressive trade moves. On Thursday, Chinese officials said that Qualcomm will have to make more concessions to compensate for the market power it would enjoy after completing the deal, without providing details.
The White House, which has already threatened tariffs on more than $150 billion in Chinese goods, is preparing new restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States and could limit American partnerships with Chinese firms abroad. Such a move could place further restraints on American companies with advanced technology, like Qualcomm, General Electric and Boeing, as they seek to form overseas partnerships. It would also likely incite more retaliation from the Chinese. On Tuesday, the administration advanced a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies, including Huawei, one of Qualcommâs competitors and a customer, to sell their products in America.
Qualcommâs situation illustrates the perils of trying to punish a major trading partner that has become a crucial link in supply chains stretching across the globe. By targeting foreign players with ties to their own markets, the United States and China are putting their own economic futures at risk. The question is whether the Trump administration will balk at paying that price â or see its goal of punishing China for unfair trade practices as more important than any collateral damage that could ensue.
âTheyâre obviously really caught in the middle,â Andrew Gilholm, the director of analysis for greater China at Control Risks, said of Qualcomm. âThe demands the Chinese government has on them, and the demands coming from the U.S. side, at some point might become irreconcilable.â
The cold war that is emerging between the United States and China is increasingly centered on the kind of advanced computer chips that Qualcomm produces. The companyâs chips are now common in smartphones, but they also serve as the basis of next-generation 5G systems, vast networks of sensors that may soon govern the function of everything from autonomous vehicles to smart power grids and manufacturing systems. Qualcomm is locked in competition with Chinaâs Huawei for dominance of this new industry.
The emergence of this technology means that, for the Trump administration, national security is no longer confined to airplanes, tanks and weapons systems. Since these chips allow companies to collect vast amounts of information, control critical infrastructure and know the location of people and objects in real time, foreign ownership could pose an unprecedented security threat.
The administrationâs focus on Qualcommâs technology may be partially of the companyâs own making. Earlier this year, the company asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates foreign acquisitions for national security threats, to intervene as it faced a hostile takeover attempt by Singapore-based Broadcom.
The Trump administration, already interested in the security implications of 5G technology, embraced the idea and made clear that the United Statesâ success was tied to Qualcommâs. âChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover,â a United States Treasury official wrote in a letter to the companies. In March, Mr. Trump scuttled Broadcomâs $117 billion bid for Qualcomm, citing security concerns.
The administration is now considering giving regulators even more power to block Chinese investments by issuing an executive order modeled on a congressional bill on reviewing mergers for national security threats, people briefed on the discussions said. Those reviews would most likely apply to certain âcritical sectorsâ that China uses its industrial policy to support â including semiconductors, aerospace and artificial intelligence.
Daniel H. Rosen, a partner at the research firm Rhodium Group, said policymakers worldwide are just now discovering that using foreign technology creates vulnerabilities that have outpaced governmentsâ ability to manage them.
âThis is not just a China-U.S. phenomenon, but a matter of things which just a few years ago we thought were relatively benign now being weaponized in ways that we havenât anticipated,â he said.
But trying to clamp down on Chinese products and investment flowing into the United States could be more painful for American companies that depend on access to partners and markets around the world than for their Chinese counterparts.
While China has already threatened tariffs of its own on United States products, it has other ways to retaliate â most notably, making life difficult for the many American businesses that depend on the country to source products or sell to Chinaâs growing middle class.
For Qualcomm, that may already be happening. Its plan to expand its business into technology-connected vehicles depends in large part on acquiring a Dutch firm, NXP Semiconductors, for $44 billion. The deal has been approved by every government except for China, whose regulators have asked for more time to assess any antitrust violations.
On Thursday, Gao Feng, a spokesman for Chinaâs Ministry of Commerce, said that the acquisition could have a âprofoundâ impact on the technology industry but that the plan Qualcomm submitted to the regulator on how it would mitigate market competition issues would not be enough.
Many observers believe that China is using the review as leverage to exert pressure on the United States, which sees Qualcommâs success as critical to American dominance in 5G.
âAt a time when there is so much trade friction, Chinese regulators donât necessarily need to stall the deal. They just need to continue postponing the review,â said Guan Zhisheng, an associate professor of economics at Sun Yat-sen University.
If trade tensions between the United States and China continue, American companies â especially those that use China as a platform to export to the United States â could see themselves embroiled in more time-consuming regulatory reviews revolving around pricing, monopoly power, food and drug safety, or bribery, Mr. Gilholm of Control Risks said. âThat is another potentially very powerful front in this that China has not really used yet,â he said.
Qualcommâs bottom line is also likely to be hurt by American efforts to target the Chinese. On Monday, the United States government said it was placing a seven-year ban on exports of American products to Chinese telecom firm ZTE, after the company made false statements to the government as part of an investigation into possible violations of American sanctions.
Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, said this will be a considerable blow to the company, which provided chips for more than half of the roughly 45 million smartphones that ZTE sold globally last year. Qualcomm declined to comment.
Qualcomm has found itself under an increasingly uncomfortable spotlight in China in recent years. By 2013, the company was deriving more revenue from China than any other market, just as the Chinese government began expressing concern that its companies were forced to depend on the network infrastructure of American technology giants like Qualcomm and Cisco.
In late 2013, Chinese government investigators raided the Beijing and Shanghai offices of Qualcomm. After a 15-month investigation, regulators handed the company a record $975 million fine and declared Qualcomm a monopoly. The firm was forced to slash prices and pledge to move more of its sophisticated manufacturing to China and help boost the technological abilities of Chinese companies. Today, a growing chorus of American companies have complained that China has pressured them into sharing their technology in similar ways.
Fang Xingdong, a free speech activist and founder of the think tank China Labs, said their complaints had little merit. âThe pressures on companies such as Huawei and ZTE in the U.S. market are much higher than those of U.S. companies in China,â he said. âThe U.S. sanctions on ZTE are enough to kill the company.â
If China wanted to retaliate, Mr. Fang said, the simplest option would be to emulate American actions toward Huawei. âThey could ban products from Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco in government, infrastructure and other areas of the market, based on security concerns,â he added.
In targeting Qualcomm, China could be seeking to influence the Trump administration by putting pressure on a company that has been politically connected in the United States, often serving as an unofficial liaison between the countries.
Over the years, Qualcomm has lobbied the United States government to further its interests in China, at one point helping to pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. In the late 1990s, Clinton administration officials pushed China to adopt American standards for mobile phones on behalf of Qualcomm.
But Qualcommâs ability to influence the White House is unclear: The Trump administration has focused on recruiting American companies to build up their businesses domestically, not encouraging them to go abroad.
âYes, the Chinese have a way to squeeze Qualcomm to really hurt their China revenue, and yes, Qualcomm has fought a lot of battles in the U.S. government arena,â said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. âThe one weakness in the Chinese approach is itâs not clear the Trump administration cares about how much U.S. firms make in China.â

"China, Feeling Left Out, Has Plenty to Worry About in North Korea-U.S. Talks","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2029061846?accountid=14586,"Correction Appended
BEIJING â As the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, prepares for his meetings with the presidents of South Korea and the United States, China has found itself in an unaccustomed place: watching from the sidelines.
Worse, many Chinese analysts say, North Korea could pursue a grand bargain designed not only to bring the isolated nation closer to its two former Korean War foes, but also diminish its reliance on China for trade and security.
Such an outcome â a reversal of 70 years of history â remains a long shot, amid doubts about whether the North would agree to relinquish its arsenal of nuclear weapons. Still, China finds itself removed from the center of the rapidly unfolding diplomacy, and unusually wary about Mr. Kimâs objectives in reaching out to his nationâs two bitterest enemies.
Mr. Kimâs meeting with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, is set for Friday, and a meeting with President Trump â the first ever between leaders of the two nations â is expected to follow in May or early June. In a sign of just how much is suddenly on the table, South Korea recently confirmed that it was in talks with the North and with the United States about signing a treaty to end the Korean War, which halted in 1953, but never formally ended.
With events moving so quickly, and Beijing finding itself largely left on the outside, analysts said China and its leader, Xi Jinping, must at least consider what they called worst-case contingencies.
âThe loss of prestige is a big problem for China and Xi, who wants everyone else to view China as an essential actor of international relations, especially in the Northeast Asian context,â said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. âNow, suddenly, China is no longer relevant.â
[âWe no longer needâ nuclear or missile tests: Rea d about whether North Korea is really willing to trade away its arsenal for economic benefits.]
In a declaration over the weekend that North Korea would suspend nuclear and missile tests, Mr. Kim spoke as if the North was already a nuclear power, and no longer needed weapons tests, a direct challenge to the Trump administrationâs stated goal of denuclearization. Washington has declared that the coming negotiations are about getting rid of the arsenal.
Still, Mr. Trump apparently wants to claim a place in history as the American leader who formally ended the Korean War â even though he tweeted on Sunday morning that he was not rushing into a deal. And Mr. Moon is eager to edge toward the reunification of the two Koreas. So China fears the outcome could be either a North Korea or a unified Korean Peninsula leaning toward the United States.
Since the 1950-53 Korean War, when China fought on the side of the North against the United States and its ally in the South, the alliances have been immovable. The North has provided a convenient buffer for China against having American troops on its border; the South serves as a base in the region for the American military.
In negotiations over the denuclearization of the North, Beijing has to worry whether all that could suddenly be in play, Chinese analysts said.
âIf a grand deal can be struck between Kim and Trump, in the form of denuclearization in exchange for normalization of bilateral relations, then Northeast Asia may see a major realignment,â Mr. Zhang said. âChina does not run Kimâs foreign policy and they know that.â
The possible new alignment on the Korean Peninsula that most concerns Beijing is a loose unification between North and South Korea with American troops remaining in the South.
As part of its conciliatory moves before the meetings, the North has dropped its demand for the departure of the 28,000 United States troops stationed in the South as a condition for denuclearization.
âA unified, democratic Korea aligned with the U.S. will be dangerous to the Communist regime in China, though not necessarily the Chinese nation,â said Xia Yafeng, a North Korea expert at Long Island University.
From Chinaâs point of view, a favorable outcome from the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim may simply be a less dangerous version of the status quo, Mr. Xia said.
There could be a ânice photoâ of the two men, with vague promises from the North Korean leader to get rid of his nuclear weapons, and then long negotiations in which China would have a big say, he said.
What is curious is that China has for decades spoken in favor of a peace treaty to end the Korean War. Premier Zhou Enlai of China mentioned ending the Korean War in a 1971 interview with T he New York Times columnist James Reston, Mr. Xia said.
China, however, has a very specific view of what such a treaty would entail: the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, which would leave both Koreas leaning toward China.
âA peace treaty is good for China in that it will presumably denuclearize North Korea, and more important, it will end the legality of the U.S. military alliance and troop presence on the peninsula,â said Yun Sun, a North Korea expert at the Stimson Center in Washington.
Since North Korea is looking for security guarantees from the United States in return for denuclearization, that guarantee âwill hopefully include the withdrawal of U.S. troops,â she said.
But, like his grandfather and father, who ruled North Korea before him, Mr. Kim has shown signs of wanting to reduce Chinaâs influence.
When the young leader made a surprise visit to Beijing three weeks ago to meet Mr. Xi for the first time, the two men seemed to repair somewhat the traditionally close relationship between the two countries that had been in the freezer since Mr. Kim came to power in 2011.
In fact, the visit was probably not so much a gesture of rapprochement as a deft move by Mr. Kim to play China against the United States, just as his grandfather had maneuvered between China and the Soviet Union, Chinese analysts said.
Mr. Kimâs purpose was to give the impression to the Americans that he was entering the meetings with China at his back, they said. Mr. Xi accepted an invitation from Mr. Kim to make a return visit to Pyongyang, but there were no signs that would happen before Mr. Trump meets with Mr. Kim, a Chinese government spokesman said.
Analysts say that since coming to power, the young Mr. Kim has resented his countryâs almost total economic dependence on Beijing, which has only increased under the tough United Nations economic sanctions that China voted for last year.
About 90 percent of the Northâs foreign trade in essential items â coal, minerals, seafood, textiles â passes through China, and China is its biggest supplier of fuel.
At the urging of the Trump administration, China approved the sanctions that have severely cut the Northâs access to fuel and hard currency. North Korean ties with China seemed to hit a low, with Mr. Kim refusing to even meet a Chinese envoy in November, and conducting a ballistic missile test instead.
Perhaps wary of alienating the North, and unhappy with Mr. Trumpâs decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, Beijing was no longer so willing to punish the North, Chinese analysts said.
There are already signs that trade is picking up along Chinaâs border with North Korea, Chinese traders say, which could mean a relaxing after six months of near total trade embargo.
Hours after the Northâs announcement on Saturday of its suspension of nuclear tests, one outspoken Chinese state-run newspaper, The Global Times, said the United Nations should âimmediately discuss the cancellation of part of the sanctions against North Korea.â
Further, the United States, South Korea and Japan should lift their unilateral sanctions against the North, the paper said.

"In a Trade War, China Might Boycott U.S. Goods. That Could Backfire.","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2029831556?accountid=14586,"TAICANG, China â If China calls for a boycott of American goods, Chinese workers like David Xu could be in trouble.
Mr. Xu is one of thousands of residents of this port town who cash paychecks from American companies. He works as a technician at a Procter & Gamble manufacturing and distribution center here, one of the companyâs biggest in China. Across town, Nike has opened a huge distribution center, its largest in Asia.
In all, more than 40 other American companies have set up shop here, making chemicals, lighters and a broad range of other products for a Chinese market eager for American goods.
âThere is no deep hatred for American companies,â said Mr. Xu, who has worked for Procter & Gamble for 13 years. âThe impact of this trade conflict shouldnât be big. After all, American companies bring so many conveniences to the lives of Chinese people.â
Some Chinese state media outlets have hinted darkly that Beijing could weaponize its hundreds of millions of shoppers should Washington go through with its recent tariff threats and start an all-out trade war. On Weibo, Chinaâs version of Twitter, there are sporadic calls to boycott Appleâs iPhones. Beijing has done it before, ably punishing Japanese, South Korean and Philippine products and companies over political disputes.
A Boycott America plan could be much tougher to pull off.
While competition from Chinese-made smartphones is rising, iPhones remain popular. Shopping mall developers, eager for the extra cachet, clamor for Starbucks to open stores. Nike dominates the sportswear market in China. Chevrolet is one of the countryâs most popular brands.
And notably, many of those products are made by Chinese workers. Factories in China assemble iPhones, stitch up Nike apparel and footwear and make Chevrolets and Fords. It isnât clear how many jobs this creates, but the American Chamber of Commerce in China said that more than one-third of its 800-plus member companies have more than 1,000 employees in the country.
âChina needs the U.S., the U.S. needs China,â said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China. âWe are joined at the hip economically.â
The United States has also supplied much of the investment underpinning Chinaâs economic growth. Between 1990 and 2017, America pumped more than $250 billion into China, according to a report by the Rhodium Group and the National Committee on United States-China Relations.
âThe U.S. multinationals have been playing a very critical part of Chinaâs development story, providing investment, technology, brands,â said Erlend Ek, trade research manager of China Policy, a Beijing-based advisory firm. âThey have a very good relationship with each other.â
Thereâs another reason that Beijing may be reluctant to try a boycott: American multinationals are aiding the Chinese government in some important projects. IBM and Walmart, for example, are collaborating with the e-commerce company JD.com and Tsinghua University to improve food safety in China, a priority for Beijing.
That isnât to say that the idea is off the table.
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Peopleâs Daily, the Communist Partyâs official newspaper, warned that a âpeopleâs warâ could be waged against the United States. On Chinese social media, the phrase âChina is not scared!â has become a popular hashtag, the Peopleâs Daily illustrating it with an image of Chinese and American boxing gloves.
âThe patriotism and collectivism of the Chinese people will likely play a role,â the newspaper said in an editorial last month. âAnd the slogans to boycott American cars and other big commodities may ring through the Chinese internet and get a response.â
Still, China has other ways to strike back without involving consumers.
Chinaâs proposed retaliatory tariffs would hit companies like Boeing. It can tell its local governments to stop buying technology from IBM or Microsoft. It can gum up business plans with regulatory hassles.
Tu Xinquan, the dean of the China Institute for W.T.O. Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, warned that the possibility of a consumer boycott on American goods âcannot be ruled out.â
âBut perhaps once the battle begins, itâs possible that we wouldnât even need the people to wage the boycott, because the governmentâs measures could be powerful enough,â Mr. Tu said.
Just the prospect of a consumer boycott worries some American business executives. Despite frustrations that include opaque regulations, the weak rule of law and demands to h and over technology to Chinese partners or officials, the allure of being able to access nearly 1.4 billion consumers with the help of a huge labor force still holds appeal.
Consumers in China can be a potent force. In 2012, Chinese nationalists wrecked Japanese stores and car dealerships and boycotted Japanese cars because of a territorial dispute, hurting sales for years. In 2016, online vendors stopped selling dried mangoes from the Philippines after a United Nations tribunal ruled in favor of Manila in another territorial dispute.
Last year, the South Korean conglomerate Lotte was forced to shut down more than 80 stores in China after the South Korean government provided land for an American missile defense system that Beijing strongly opposed.
More recently, Chinese nationalists have besieged the social media accounts of Western companies that labeled Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing considers a breakaway region, and Tibet as countries.
William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said a boycott âis one of the many tools that the Chinese have in their toolbox.â
âBecause of the structure of the government and the political power of the party, they can call for a boycott and get a pretty good response,â Mr. Zarit said. âSo that concerns me.â
Taicang, a 90-minute drive from Shanghai, underscores how interdependent the two economies are.
Some of the biggest names in corporate America, like Honeywell and Exxon Mobil, have converged on this city of close to a million people. Its economy is growing faster than the countryâs as a whole. It is richer than Shanghai on a per-capita basis. Last year, Taicang topped a list of Chinaâs 10 happiest âcounty-level citiesâ for the second year in a row.
In a sprawling factory, Procter & Gamble makes its Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Vidal Sassoon shampoos and then distributes them along with other cosmetics and skin care products. When the factory opened, the company said it would provide 1,500 jobs for Chinese workers. Across town is a 200,000-square-meter Nike logistics center, which that company has also said would employ 1,500 people.
In total, 42 American factories are in the Taicang economic development zone, with a total annual output value of about $4.7 billion, the government of the much larger city of Suzhou, which administers Taicang, said in February.
The influx of money can be seen in the relative affluence of the Procter & Gamble employees, most of whom drive Japanese-made cars to work. One female employee, surnamed Li, said workers were confident that what they made in the factory would appeal to Chinese consumers, who she said were rational about what they bought.
Analysts say Beijing is aware of the importance of American companies to Chinaâs economy. Ernan Cui, a consumer analyst at the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, said a boycott could have many victims.
âDue to the integration of the economies, whatever China does to the U.S. will end up hurting itself,â Ms. Cui said.

China Is Set to Take a Hard Line on Trumpâs Trade Demands,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2033007963?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Staking an assertive negotiating stance, China says it will refuse to discuss President Trumpâs two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.
The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in Americaâs $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijingâs $300 billion plan to bankroll the countryâs industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.
The reason: Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States.
[On other trade fronts, even American allies arenât sure what the Trump administration plans. Read more about their concerns.]
A half-dozen senior Chinese officials and two dozen influential advisers laid out the Chinese governmentâs position in detail during a three-day seminar that ended here late Monday morning. The officials and most of the advisers at the seminar gave an overview of Chinaâs economic policies, including an in-depth review of the countryâs trade policy, to make sure Chinaâs stance would be known overseas. All of the officials and most of the advisers at the seminar insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.
It is not clear what will happen when the two sides sit down this week or whether either will find a reason to waver. Still, the Chinese and American positions are so far apart that Chinaâs leaders are skeptical the two sides can find common ground by the end of this week. They are already raising the possibility that Chinese officials may fly to Washington a month from now for further talks.
âI donât expect a comprehensive deal whatsoever,â said Ruan Zongze, the executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, which is the policy research arm of Chinaâs Foreign Ministry. âI think there is a lot of game playing here.â
Beijing is frustrated with Mr. Trumpâs threats to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese goods and dismayed by suggestions in the West that China has a weak bargaining position. Chinese officials think the countryâs one-party political system and President Xi Jinpingâs enduring grip on power â particularly after the repeal of presidential term limits in March â mean that China can outlast the United States and Mr. Trump in any trade quarrel.
The Chinese government believes Mr. Trumpâs background as a businessman means that at some point he will agree to a deal. Seminar participants also reaffirmed previous Chinese trade policy offers to further open the countryâs financial and automotive sectors, though not in ways that would impact Chinaâs industrial modernization program, called Made in China 2025. They also suggested that China would be willing to tighten its intellectual property rules so as to foster innovation within China as well as protect foreign technologies from counterfeiting and other illegal copying.
China is insisting that the parameters of any negotiations be limited, and that the tariff threat be removed before a final deal can be struck.
Chinese officials have reached out to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has reacted positively to Chinaâs overtures in the auto and financial sectors. Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who will be on the Trump administrationâs team in Beijing later this week, has sought to calm investors worried that the rhetoric between Washington and Beijing could break out into a full-blown trade war.
Chinaâs position is that the bilateral trade imbalance arises from differences in savings rates. Households in China save roughly two-fifths of their income. Americans, on average, save almost nothing. So money from China tends to flow to the United States, buying factories, technology companies, real estate and more, and Americans in turn spend much of that money to buy goods from China. Many economists in the United States, including some at the Treasury, share that view.
By contrast, many trade lawyers, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and Mr. Trump contend that the trade deficit stems to a large extent from unfair practices, including cheap loans by state-controlled banks to exporters.
China is ready to discuss shrinking the $375 billion annual trade deficit. But it wants to do so by buying more high-tech American goods. Washington has long blocked such deals because of concerns that they may have military value. China is also willing to buy more oil, natural gas, coal and other goods from the United States, and to help finance the extra pipelines and other infrastructure that would be needed to move them to China.
A senior Chinese government official said that Beijing is unwilling to negotiate with the United States on any curbs on Made in China 2025, which includes large-scale government assistance to favored industries in advanced-technology manufacturing. China perceives the American demands as an attempt to stop Chinaâs economic development and technological progress, the senior Chinese official said.
Germany and other countries also have industrial policies, and the United States has not objected to them, he added. American and European officials have argued that those policies elsewhere are much narrower and less ambitious.
Other advisers and officials said that the United States had misunderstood the Made in China 2025 industrial policy. They expressed hope that it might be possible to resolve differences by explaining the program better and making very small tweaks to it â a stance that still may not appease the Trump administration.
The Chinese government is not simply throwing money, land and other resources to favored industries like robotics, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and aircraft manufacturing, they said. China is engaged instead, they contended, in a carefully thought-out program that measures potential profits for each dollar of investment. So Chinaâs program bears some resemblance, they said, to private sector investment programs in the West.
One subject was repeatedly and conspicuously avoided by all officials throughout the seminar, even when advisers occasionally speculated about it: whether China might someday try to link trade disputes to national security issues.
China has been deeply involved in international pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, an issue of high importance to the Trump administration. Beijing also wants to someday assert control of Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing regards as a renegade territory.
Tsinghua Universityâs new Academic Center for Chinese Economic Practice and Thinking organized the seminar, which was held at Tsinghua and two other venues in western Beijing. President Xi graduated from Tsinghua, which is in Beijing and is Chinaâs top university, and he has filled much of the senior ranks of his government with Tsinghua professors and graduates.
In some respects, the hard stance struck by Chinese officials reflects a hardening of public attitudes in China.
In mid-April, the United States barred American companies from selling their wares to a Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE. The move is seen as potentially crippling to the Chinese company, which needs American chips and software to power the smartphones and equipment it sells around the world.
Washington officials cited ZTEâs repeated violations of sanctions against Iran and North Korea, but many in China saw it as a reminder by the United States that sizable sectors of the Chinese economy still rely on American-made goods. Much of the Made in China 2025 policy is aimed at reducing that dependence.
The ZTE case âhas changed a lot of Chinese peopleâs opinion,â said Mr. Ruan, of the China Institute of International Studies. âIn the past, people saw us as interdependent.â

The U.S. and China Are Finally Having It Out,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2033905694?accountid=14586,"With the arrival in Beijing this week of Americaâs top trade negotiators, you might think that the U.S. and China are about to enter high-level talks to avoid a trade war and that this is a story for the business pages. Think again. This is one for the history books.
Five days of meetings in Beijing with Chinese, U.S. and European government officials and business leaders made it crystal clear to me that whatâs going on right now is nothing less than a struggle to redefine the rules governing the economic and power relations of the worldâs oldest and newest superpowers â America and China. This is not a trade tiff.
âThis is a defining moment for U.S.-China relations,â said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the Chinese Foreign Ministryâs research institute. âThis is about a lot more than trade and tariffs. This is about the future.â
In one corner stand President Trump and his team of China trade hard-liners, whose instinct is basically right: This is a fight worth having now, before it is too late, before China gets too big.
And in the other corner stands President Xi Jinping of China, whose instinct may also be right â this is a fight worth having now, because it is too late â China is just too big.
Or, as one Chinese expert put it at a Tsinghua University dialogue on trade I attended, âNo one can contain China anymore.â You hear that confidence in Beijing a lot today from Chinese: Our one-party system and unified society can take the pain of a trade war far longer than you Americans can. And there is a trade imbalance today because weâve been investing in our future and you Americans have been eating yours.
A Chinese economist who worked in the West summarized it this way: âYou brought China into the world and changed China,â but now China is in the world and it is becoming âself-propelled.â
Hereâs how we got here: In Act I, U.S.-China relations were all geopolitics, with the U.S. and China against the Soviet Union. That lasted until the late 1970s, when Act II began: China shifted toward capitalism, becoming a huge factory and new market â and 30 years later turned into the worldâs second-largest economy.
In large part this was due to the work ethic of the Chinese people, the long-term thinking of Chinaâs leaders and the governmentâs massive investments in infrastructure and education. But in part it was also due to Chinaâs willingness and ability to bend or ignore rules of the World Trade Organization and, at times, outright cheat.
In some cases China used industrial espionage to just steal innovations from the West. Other moves were more subtle: When China joined the W.T.O. in 2001, it was allowed in as a âdeveloping nation,â subject to very low tariffs on its exports to our country but permitted to impose high tariffs to protect its own rising industries from U.S. and European competition.
The assumption was that as China grew, and the W.T.O. moved to a new regime, China would quickly cut its tariffs â like its 25 percent tax on car imports, compared with the 2.5 percent tariff imposed by the U.S. But the W.T.O. still has not completed a new trade round and China has refused to voluntarily lower its tariffs.
Moreover, China developed an industrial policy that often bent W.T.O. rules. The government gave away cheap land, and state-guided banks granted cheap loans for new industries, but foreign companies that wanted access to Chinaâs market were forced to pay to play â to have a Chinese partner and be willing to transfer their advanced technology to them.
As a result, over time, Beijing was able to force multinationals to shift more and more of their supply chains to China, and grow Chinese competitors to Western companies in its protected market, and then, once they were big enough, unleash them on the world as giants.
Even when the U.S. protested to the W.T.O. â as in the case of how China unfairly kept U.S. credit card companies out, then lost the arbitration case at the W.T.O. â China still dragged its feet before following through on promises made 17 years earlier to open up. By then, Chinese companies, like UnionPay, so dominated Chinaâs credit card market that U.S. companies, like Visa, were left with the crumbs.
Meanwhile, Chinese government-guided companies and investment funds went abroad and began to buy up strategic industries to bring their technology back to China â like Germanyâs biggest and best robotics company, Kuka.
U.S. and European businesses tolerated all of this because they were still making money in China or were afraid to be frozen out of its massive, growing market â until a couple years ago, when more and more told their governments: This is not working anymore. That ushered in Act III.
ACT III opened in October 2015, when China announced its new long-term vision: âMade in China 2025,â a plan to dominate 10 next-generation industries, including robotics, self-driving cars, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, biotech and aerospace.
When the U.S. and Europe saw this, they basically said: Wow. We were ready to turn the other cheek when your combination of hard work, cheating and industrial policy was focused on low-end industries. But if you use the same strategies to dominate these high-end industries, weâre toast. We need some new rules.
And I heard this as much from E.U. officials as U.S. ones. That is why many E.U. countries are now scrambling to pass new laws to prevent China from buying up their most advanced industries. And that is why China is telling E.U. countries, as one E.U. official put it, âWhatever you do, donât join the U.S. campâ on trade. The last thing Beijing wants is a U.S.-E.U. united front demanding it play fair.
Donât get me wrong. I am a free trader and genuinely not afraid of some state-directed 2025 plan beating Western free-market innovators. I welcome China focusing more on 21st-century industries. It could be better for everyone.
Economics is not like war â they can win and we can win. On one condition â we all play by the same rules: hard work and innovation, not hard work and stealing intellectual property, massive government interventions, ignoring W.T.O. rules, lack of reciprocity and forcing Western companies to pay to play inside China.
That is what this moment is about â thatâs why itâs a fight worth having. Donât let the fact that Trump is leading the charge distract from the vital importance of the U.S., Europe and China all agreeing on the same rules for 2025 â before it really is too late.
Have no doubt, though: Both Presidents Trump and Xi are approaching this moment with enormously high-risk strategies.
At a time when we are at a historic juncture in defining the Westâs economic relations with China â clearly our No. 1 priority â Trump is also risking a trade war with the very allies we need to move China in the right direction â Japan, South Korea, Europe and Canada â by threatening them with steel and aluminum tariffs if they donât meet his demands. Trump seems to believe that he can reshape how China approaches the next era of global trade without allies â just American brute force. Good luck with that.
As one E.U. official warned me: âIf your concern is U.S. jobs, China is the big challenge and you should not be starting a steel war with Europe. Nobody is going to go with you on China if youâre hitting us on steel.â Added one longtime U.S. observer in Beijing: âIf we make this the U.S. versus China alone, we lose.â
Worse, Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have brought together the most powerful economies on the Pacific Rim around a set of trade rules perfectly aligned with U.S. interests and focused on all those things, like intellectual property, that we want China to embrace as it moves to 2025.
In short, with a lot of allies in Europe and on the Pacific, we might be able to move China in the right direction. But Trump is alienating them all. How foolish is that?
Trump also has nothing to say about investing in the real source of long-term U.S. strength â infrastructure and education.
But Xiâs bet is also no slam dunk. China is a much more open country today than it was 25 years ago â but itâs also much less open than it was five years ago. Xiâs allies argue that his crackdown on corruption; his repeal of term limits, which position him to rule for what could be decades; and his tightening of the control that the Communist Party wields over every institution was urgent because collective rule did not work. Chinaâs society, government and military were being eaten away by corruption from within, those allies say.
That may have been true. But creating a regime of one-man rule; controlling the internet, free speech and universities more tightly than ever; and resurrecting the teaching of Marxist thought cannot be the best way to stimulate and attract the most creative and innovative minds that China needs to propel a start-up economy and deliver on âMade in China 2025.â
Will Chinaâs best and brightest want to work in such a system? I donât know. Chinaâs autocracy has managed to produce a tremendous number of patents and start-ups so far, so maybe Xi can pull this off. But itâs a big bet.
As I said, this is not just a front-page business news story. Whatâs being written is the first page of a whole new chapter in the history of U.S.-China relations. And how it gets written and how it ends will shape the Trump and Xi legacies â and touch every major economy in the world.

"On Trade, the U.S. and China Consider the Unthinkable: Breaking Up","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2040032109?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â The economic relationship between China and the United States has defined the modern era. It helped lift hundreds of millions of people in China out of poverty. It gave affordable iPhones and other gadgets to American consumers, handed big profits to American companies and delivered 1.3 billion hungry customers to American farmers.
Now some people in both countries want to tear it apart.
As a top Chinese economic policymaker meets with the Trump administration this week in hopes of heading off a potential trade war, some officials in both countries are planning for a time when the worldâs two biggest economies do not need each other quite so much any more. They are seeking nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of a trade relationship that encompasses more than $700 billion in goods and services that flow between the countries every year.
Full disengagement is impossible, leaders on both sides acknowledge. But the plans being developed in Beijing and Washington anticipate a time when the economic engines of China and the United States are not so closely linked, particularly in high-tech industries.
âIn the next step of tackling technology, we must cast aside illusions and rely on ourselves,â President Xi Jinping of China said last month after visiting a new computer microchip factory in the countryâs center.
Beijing has Made in China 2025, a plan that calls for the country to become largely self-sufficient and globally competitive in 10 advanced manufacturing sectors now dominated by the West. These include commercial aircraft, robotics, 5G mobile phone communications and computer microchips.
China currently depends on the United States and its allies for those elements of a high-tech future. Washington showed that last month with its move to deny American-made components to ZTE, bringing the Chinese companyâs factories to a halt.
But Washington is also worried about Chinaâs efforts to build homegrown champions. The Trump administration blocked the chip maker Broadcomâs proposed acquisition of Qualcomm, a rival, this year, over concerns that the deal would give Chinaâs Huawei an advantage in 5G technology.
The United States has outlined its own strategy of sorts to wean itself from China. Should the Trump administration enact its threated tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese-made goods, the thinking goes, American corporations would begin to reduce their reliance on Chinese-made small components, machinery and other dull-but-essential parts in the global supply chain.
President Trumpâs proposed tariffs are partly targeted at industries where customers would have an easier time switching to a supplier based in either the United States or a friendly ally like Germany, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico or India. In most of the initial product categories the administration has identified for tariffs, less than half of the goods imported by American companies come from China.
Leviâs has a plan for protecting itself should tensions escalate further. If the Trump administration imposes a levy on clothes made in China, the company could sell American consumers jeans made in Vietnam, Cambodia or one of the three dozen or so other countries where it has suppliers.
âItâs a shell game,â said Chip Bergh, the chief executive of Leviâs. He added, âWeâll probably still be making a lot of product in China but it just wonât be coming to the U.S.â He noted that jeans made in China could be sold to consumers in Mexico instead.
The tariffs are also geared toward the products that will shape the future. China exports almost nothing now in some categories that the Trump administration carefully included in its list for planned tariffs, like electric cars and satellites. But Chinaâs leaders hope that with government nurturing, such industries will soon become big exporters.
American laws and World Trade Organization rules allow countries to impose tariffs on subsidized goods from overseas that harm domestic industries. But the Trump administration is trying to pre-empt Chinese exports of subsidized high-tech goods to the United States by imposing tariffs in advance.
United States trade officials are counting on tariffs to have long-lasting effects. Decades-old levies on imported pickup trucks, for example, help explain why essentially all pickups sold in the United States â even those made by Japanese companies like Toyota â are made in America.
American trade policy âwill respond to hostile economic competitors, will recognize the importance of technology, and will seek opportunities to work with other countries that share our goals,â Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, recently told the Senate Finance Committee.
The focus on disengagement reflect broader political realities. China is rapidly building a world-class navy; conducting military exercises in Africa and off the shores of northern Europe; and developing some of the worldâs most advanced stealth fighter planes and ballistic missiles. The military muscle-flexing has caused alarm in Washington and directly influenced trade policy.
In China, leaders were alarmed five years ago by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowdenâs disclosures that American intelligence services had involved technology companies in the United States in its spying on China and its allies. China also faces rising labor costs â meaning cheap manufacturing will no longer provide as many jobs â and has a rising class of educated young people for whom it needs to find well-paying, high-tech jobs. While many American and European companies see Made in China 2025 as building up government-supported rivals, Chinese leaders see the plan as essential to the countryâs future prosperity.
ZTEâs punishment, in particular, exposed big gaps in Chinaâs economic prowess.
âIt seems likely that the current trade dispute, and the ZTE sanctions in particular, will spur the Chinese government to double down on its economic autarky model, where they seek self-sufficiency in a wider array of technology-based products,â said Robert D. Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington policy research group backed partly by Western technology companies.
The Chinese and American plans both face long odds.
At first glance, Chinaâs might seem to have a better chance of success. The countryâs state-controlled banking system can steer huge loans at very low interest rates to any industry the central government chooses. Local governments have also been urged to promote targeted industries, which they can do through subsidies like providing downtown land at virtually no cost. Semiconductor factories are now rising in major cities all over China, posing a formidable challenge to the industryâs global players.
But China has a long way to go. It trails the United States significantly in crucial areas like microchips, software design and high-end precision manufacturing. As one example, semiconductors designed in the United States make up half the chips China buys every year. American companies can already design and will soon be manufacturing semiconductors with circuits just one-fifth of the size of Chinese circuits.
But the United States faces its own challenges. Washington could find it extremely difficult to lure back factories that moved to China over the years. Chinese workers may be more expensive to employ than they once were, but they are still paid a quarter or less than American workers. China has also become a vast new market in its own right â one that companies are loath to leave â and has invested huge sums in highways, bullet trains and other systems that make connecting buyers and sellers cheap and easy.
And some industries simply may never come back. For example, Mr. Trumpâs proposed tariffs will not touch the consumer electronics industry, in an acknowledgment that the business of making iPhones and Xboxes will stay in China for the foreseeable future.
Foxconn, a Taiwan company that makes iPhones and other devices, has begun building a manufacturing complex in India and is preparing to build one in the United States, too. Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra state in India, which includes Mumbai, said in an interview that he had recently met with a group of chief executives of American companies who also wanted to place big bets on new factories in the country.
âThey were very bullish on India,â Mr. Fadnavis said, âand now Iâm getting more and more inquiries from the U.S.â
But politics, not economics, have played a major role in those decisions, and progress has been slow. Despite a plan to build factories employing 50,000 people in the western Indian state of Maharashtra by 2020, Foxconn now has 16,500 workers in all of India. In China, it has one million.
âWe are continuing to invest in expanding our presence and capabilities in locations throughout China,â Foxconn said in a statement.
Jie Zhao, a public policy specialist at Fudan University, predicted that increased economic self-reliance in the United States and China would not come quickly, but that it may lie ahead anyway.
âNeither China nor the U.S. can eliminate the economic interdependence of each other at this moment in time,â she said. âBut reducing their dependence could be an option for getting ahead in the technological competition and world-power reorganization.â

Chinese negotiators left Washington this weekend with a significant win: a willingness by the Trump administration to hold off for now on imposing tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese imports. China gave up little in return, spurning the administrationâs nudges for a concrete commitment to buy more goods from the United States, and avoiding limits on its efforts to build new high-tech Chinese industries.
The trade fight is far from over. And large Chinese technology companies in particular could be vulnerable if the United States starts punching again, with administration officials appearing to back away from Mr. Trumpâs pledges to help ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company hit with severe American penalties.
Still, the latest round of negotiations showed that a confident China could be more than a match for divided American officials who have made often discordant demands. Mr. Trump, who proclaimed this year that âtrade wars are good, and easy to win,â and his advisers may find that extracting concessions from China is much harder than they expected it would be.
Chinaâs propaganda machine took a victory lap after the talks, proclaiming that a strong challenge from the United States had been turned aside, at least for now. âWhether in Beijing or Washington, in the face of the unreasonable demands of the United States, the Chinese government has always resolutely fought back, never compromised, and did not accept the restrictions set by the other side,â the official Xinhua news service said in a commentary on Sunday.
In a cheeky expression of Chinaâs rising power, two juxtaposed photos were widely circulated on Chinese social media, a post that was shared (but later deleted) by the Communist Youth League. One photo was taken during the trade talks in Washington, appearing, if somewhat biasedly, to trumpet the youthfulness of Chinese delegates compared with American lawmakers. Another, dated from 1901, showed the opposite as representatives from China and colonial powers signed an accord to end the Boxer Rebellion, considered a national humiliation.
On Monday, Mr. Trump defended the approach, promoting the talks as a success. On Twitter, he said that barriers would âcome down for the first time,â and that China would âpurchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce.â
But American negotiators were dealing with a China eager to show its strengths. During last weekâs talks, China for the first time sent a strategic bomber to an island reef in the South China Sea, an area where Beijing has laid claims of sovereignty â claims the United States has challenged.
Chinaâs success partly comes from its ability to stick to a single strategy in trade. Even as Beijing has shown a willingness to talk and make peace offerings in the form of multibillion-dollar import contracts, it has held fast to its refusal to make any commitment for a fixed reduction in its trade gap with the United States. The trade imbalance between the countries has actually widened since Mr. Trump visited Beijing in November and oversaw the signing of import deals on everything from beef to helicopters.
Beijing also has not bent on its Made in China 2025 initiative, an industrial modernization program that Washington and American business groups complain forces foreign companies to share their best technology while potentially creating state-sponsored rivals.
China said on Monday that it welcomed more talks.
âThe two sides have come to recognize that only through consultation can we properly handle trade disputes,â Lu Kang, the spokesman for Chinaâs foreign ministry, said during his daily news briefing on Monday.
Chinese propaganda was quieter on signs that the Trump administration may be backing away from Mr. Trumpâs pledge to help ZTE, which Washington moved to punish for breaking American sanctions on Iran, North Korea and other countries.
A ban on selling American-made chips and other equipment to ZTE has brought the companyâs factories to a halt. But on Sunday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the United States was not prepared to revisit the penalties and that Mr. Trump wanted to be âvery toughâ on ZTE.
Chinaâs problems in the area of technology could get worse. American officials are investigating whether a much bigger Chinese tech company, Huawei Technologies, also flouted American trade controls. Huawei has said it adheres to international conventions and local laws.
Despite that vulnerability, China has plenty of negotiating strengths.
White House trade officials have more expertise with trade law, but China has a small but cohesive team of negotiators who report directly to Liu He, a vice premier and nearly lifelong friend of Xi Jinping, the countryâs top leader. The group has also streamlined Beijingâs ability to make economic policy decisions, a benefit in evaluating the impact of any concessions to the United States. Policy decisions that once took a month can now take as little as a day, said a person with a detailed knowledge of the process who insisted on anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the issue.
By contrast, the United States has shifted its demands and struggled to send out a consistent message.
The internal divisions were on display again on Sunday. Mr. Mnuchin said in the morning that any tariffs were on hold. Later that day, Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, issued a statement in which he said, âAs this process continues, the United States may use all of its legal tools to protect our technology through tariffs, investment restrictions and export regulations.â
In March and early April, Mr. Trump and his trade advisers threatened to impose tariffs unless Beijing agreed to curb long-term subsidies for high-tech industries.
The president then shifted to conciliation.
His financial policy advisers, led by Mr. Mnuchin, sought a fixed reduction of up to $200 billion in the $375 billion American trade deficit with Beijing. Chinaâs trade negotiators resisted again, and the administration ended the weekend with a joint statement by officials from the two countries that did not commit China to any specific concessions.
Chinese and American officials did exchange lists last week of extra goods that China might buy to narrow the deficit. But China only committed to continue buying ever-rising quantities of American food and fossil fuels, a position reflected in the joint communiquÃ© issued at the close of the talks.
The United States has also explicitly tied the trade talks to its efforts to negotiate with North Korea. Mr. Xi met with Kim Jong-un, North Koreaâs leader, in northeastern China about two weeks ago. It is not clear what they discussed, but Mr. Trump suggested on Thursday that China might have prodded Mr. Kim to threaten to cancel the summit meeting between the two leaders planned for June 12.
While experts on Chinese policymaking are deeply divided on Mr. Xiâs influence, Mr. Trumpâs perception of a link indicates that at the very least the North Korea issue may have been a constraint on American officialsâ willingness to confront their Chinese counterparts.
Even in small ways, the White House has sent mixed messages. Mr. Liu last week held meetings with both Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in Washington even as the Chinese official resisted American pressure for compromises. Chinese state media presented the move as a minor victory, as Mr. Liu was not allowed to meet with Mr. Trump at a meeting in February. While Mr. Liu held a lower-ranked government position then, his eventual rise to a top post had already been widely signaled.
In some ways, Beijing may find it almost impossible to agree to American demands. The United States exports only $130 billion in goods a year to China. Finding more goods to buy to reduce Chinaâs trade surplus by $200 billion would be extremely difficult, except if China cut its own exports to the United States.
âIt is kind of unrealistic â and if Chinese officials agree, they will face a lot of pressure from public opinion,â said Tu Xinquan, the head of the China Institution for World Trade Organization Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.

"China Tries to Erase Taiwan, One Ally (and Website) at a Time","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244175743?accountid=14586,"TAIPEI, Taiwan â Can China use its enormous economic and diplomatic leverage to simply erase Taiwanâs international identity?
China seems to be trying. But its increasingly aggressive posture toward Taiwan is creating a backlash here that is undermining Beijingâs ultimate goal: bringing the islandâs 23 million residents under its authority.
China continues to peel away the dwindling number of allies that recognize Taiwan as an independent country â most recently, on Thursday, Burkina Faso. This week, it blocked Taiwanâs representatives â even its journalists â from participating, with observer status, in the World Health Organizationâs annual assembly in Geneva.
Although China has long sought to isolate Taiwan, people here said its latest efforts have been the most intense in decades. Chinaâs economic and diplomatic moves have coincided with a series of military exercises that officials said were explicitly aimed at Taiwan and its president since 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally supported independence.
China recently warned 36 airlines to change their online booking systems to refer to Taiwan as part of China, even though the island is a self-governing democracy that has never been under the control of the Communist government in Beijing. While the White House denounced the demand as âOrwellian nonsense,â many airlines have complied, though not the major American ones.
Companies in other industries have also capitulated in the face of Chinese tetchiness about Taiwanâs status. Last week, The Gap apologized for the design of a T-shirt that showed China without including Taiwan, after photographs of the offending apparel circulated on Chinese social media.
âThe Chinese government always says it wants to win the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese people, but their military threats against Taiwan and the diplomatic assault against Taiwan are not doing that,â the foreign minister, Joseph Wu, recently told reporters.
The pressure on Taiwan might not be a single, coordinated campaign, but rather the result of different branches of the Chinese government scrambling to appear supportive of President Xi Jinpingâs increasingly nationalistic oratory. In a forceful speech in March, Mr. Xi warned against efforts to divide the âgreat motherland,â which in Chinaâs view includes Taiwan.
Even the slightest misstep can provoke Chinaâs vindictive pique.
The countryâs Civil Aviation Administration issued the warning to the airlines in April, after Delta apologized for causing the Chinese people âemotional damageâ by listing Taiwan on its booking site as a destination separate from China. In Shanghai, the Administration of Industry and Commerce recently fined a Japanese retailer, Muji, because items in some of its stores were labeled âMade in Taiwan.â
âChinaâs goal regarding Taiwan has never changed,â Lee Teng-hui, who in 1996 became Taiwanâs first democratically elected president, said in a rare interview.
âThat goal is to swallow up Taiwanâs sovereignty, exterminate Taiwanese democracy and achieve ultimate unification,â said Mr. Lee. At 96, the former leader is calling for a referendum that could pave a path toward sovereignty by explicitly declaring the island Taiwan, not the Republic of China, as it is formally known.
Ms. Tsaiâs government has tried to push back against Chinaâs campaign â âon a daily basis,â as Mr. Wu, the foreign minister, put it. He and others here acknowledge, however, that Chinaâs economic clout has cowed corporations â and countries â fearful of losing access to the worldâs largest consumer market.
Fire EX, an indie punk band here in Taiwan, knows what it is like to endure Chinaâs disapproval.
Because of the membersâ outspoken support for independence, the bandâs music has disappeared from Chinese music-streaming services. In 2015, the live broadcast of a Taiwanese music awards ceremony was censored in China when the band won the prize for song of the year. The song, âIslandâs Sunrise,â had become an anthem for a protest movement opposing closer economic ties with China.
Fire EX once played in China, but it has not done so since the protests, depriving it of revenue and greater exposure among millions of potential Mandarin-speaking fans.
âThose who want to make money will never touch on these topics,â said the bandâs lead singer, who prefers to be known by a single name, Sam. âNot talking about these things makes many people believe they are not important. So actually, Chinaâs tactic has succeeded.â
The cost for China, though, is high.
The cultural and political divides between China and Taiwan are only deepening. Although many in Taiwan are descendants of Chinese who, along with the Republic of China government, fled the civil war that ended with the Communist takeover in 1949, the potential appeal of unification has waned here, at least in part because of Chinaâs aggressive attitude.
âItâs totally two different countries,â Sam said.
Others, too, are resisting.
Wu Ming-yi, whose novel âThe Stolen Bicycleâ made the long list of finalists for the Man Booker International Prize this year, objected publicly when his nationality was changed from âTaiwanâ to âTaiwan, China,â on the prizeâs website.
The prize committee, which made the change after the Chinese Embassy in London complained, agreed to change it back. But it still bowed to Chinaâs sensitivities, altering the category to say âcountry/territoryâ instead of nationality.
Mr. Wu declined an interview on the subject, but in a Facebook post he said that to erase the name Taiwan would diminish his writing.
âMy works have been inspired by cultures all over the world but rely entirely on the germination, growth and evolution of the land âTaiwan,ââ he wrote. âLike the Taiwan clouded leopards in my next work, the Taiwan hemlock, the ocean around it and the more than 200 mountains of three thousand meters â to abandon this land, this name, my work would have no basis.â
While many here still look to China for economic opportunities, Ms. Tsaiâs government is moving to strengthen economic â and diplomatic â ties with friendlier countries, including the United States, the European Union and Japan.
Ms. Tsai reacted angrily when Burkina Faso severed official relations and recognized China. Its move came only weeks after the Dominican Republic did the same. Now only 17 countries and the Vatican have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
âThe atrocious actions by China aimed at denigrating our sovereignty are testing our bottom line,â Ms. Tsai told reporters on Thursday night, according to the state-owned Central News Agency. âWe will tolerate no more. It serves only to strengthen our resolve to be part of the wider world.â
As the worldâs 22nd-largest economy, Taiwan has its own leverage, and many here argue that the government could use it to become less dependent on economic ties with China, which are deep despite the political frictions.
âThe economy is over-reliant on China,â said Mr. Lee, the former president. âChinaâs economic incentives for Taiwan are part of a policy to create addictive subsidies that serve a political agenda.â
Still others cling to a quixotic hope that Taiwan can reverse the tide and emerge with independent, internationally recognized status.
In Hsinchu, a technology hub on the western coast, 200 students participating in an annual Model United Nations conference last weekend practiced the ways of an organization in which Taiwan, because of China, is not now allowed to participate.
âItâs hard to change the situation right now,â one of them, Grace Kung, 15, acknowledged. But she and her peers brim with hope that that could change.
Ms. Kung criticized the World Health Organization for not inviting Taiwan to the annual assembly on global health. âThe government and people of Taiwan want to help,â she said. âWe shouldnât be blocked by any government, including Chinaâs, because of a political stance.â
By chance, she was assigned to represent China in the studentsâ model conference, which gave her an appreciation of what Taiwan is up against.
âBeing the delegate for China,â she said, âis a powerful feeling.â

ZTEâs Near-Collapse May Be Chinaâs Sputnik Moment,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2053073085?accountid=14586,"HONG KONG â Once derided as a technology backwater and copycat, China is justifiably proud of its technology boom. Its people zip around the country on high-speed trains. They can buy, and pay for, just about anything with their smartphones. For Chinese traveling abroad, the rest of the world can seem slow and antiquated.
Now, that progress has been cast into doubt, and even some of the smartest people in the technology world are asking how they got it so wrong.
The Trump administration gave ZTE, which employs 75,000 people and is the worldâs No. 4 maker of telecom gear, a stay of execution on Thursday. ZTE, which had violated American sanctions, agreed to pay a $1 billion fine and to allow monitors to set up shop in its headquarters. In return, the company â once a symbol of Chinaâs progress and engineering know-how â will be allowed to buy the American-made microchips, software and other tools it needs to survive.
Chinaâs technology boom, it turns out, has been largely built on top of Western technology.
The ZTE incident, as it is called in China, may be the countryâs Sputnik moment. Like the United States in 1957, watching helplessly as the Soviet Union launched the first human-made satellite, many people in China now see how far the country still has to go.
âWe realized,â said Dong Jielin, an adjunct professor at the Research Center for Technological Innovation at Tsinghua University in Beijing, âthat Chinaâs prosperity was built on sand.â
China now feels a new urgency to change that.
This week, I begin a column for The New York Times that looks at the paradox of modern China through the lens of technology. For years, China has defied the axiom that a free political system and economic growth go hand in hand. The thriving tech industry is the epitome of the so-called China model, which says people can rise and prosper under tight government control.
Most people outside China think of it as â1984,â a dystopian society ruled by a repressive government with powerful brainwashing machines, which it is in many ways. But if you live in China, it feels more like that other dystopian novel, âBrave New World.â Itâs a colorful, vibrant and consumeristic society. In many ways, Chinese people have more choice than they ever had before â except when it comes to individual liberty.
China offers a competing vision to those who see technology as a global, liberating force. Its robust online culture coexists with stringent censorship. China forcefully espouses a view of sovereignty in the cyber realm that sees a greater degree of government control than the internetâs creators ever envisioned â a view that doesnât seem as far-fetched as it once did, as politicians around the world grapple with the unintended consequences of technology.
Before we get to that future, however, the ZTE incident offers a glimpse of where China stands now.
ZTEâs near-collapse has shaken tech entrepreneurs, investors and ordinary Chinese people alike. In social media chat groups, at dinner tables, at industry conferences, terms like âsemiconductorsâ and âfundamental scientific researchâ have become buzzwords. My novelist, economist and philosophy professor friends all ask me: How far behind is Chinaâs microchip industry? How long will it take us to catch up with the United States? (Some ask even more basic questions, like: Whatâs a microchip?)
âThe recent ZTE incident made us see clearly that no matter how advanced our mobile payment is, without mobile devices, without microchips and operating systems, we canât compete competently,â Pony Ma, chief executive of the Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings said last month at a science forum.
China feels new urgency to increase its technological abilities. Its current push â called Made in China 2025 â lies at the root of worsening trade relations between the United States and China. But the problems with ZTE, which had $17 billion in revenue in 2017, will only spur Chinese leaders to push ahead.
âSelf-reliance is the foundation for the Chinese nation to stand firmly in the world, while independent innovation is the only way for us to climb the peak of the worldâs science and technology,â Xi Jinping, Chinaâs leader, told its top scientists late last month.
As Chinese ask how they can keep up, many are also wondering why they didnât realize they were so far behind to begin with.
âThe best students always think they performed poorly in exams,â said Ding Jichang, founder and chief executive of Mobiuspace, a Chinese mobile app developer, âwhile the bad students always think they aced it.â
For starters, the idea of China as technology powerhouse isnât wrong. As Mr. Ding pointed out, Chinese companies early on figured out the power of the smartphone in daily life. ZTE and others are competitive in many areas, like mobile data technology.
But many in China â and many cheerleaders of the Chinese tech scene â also found themselves in a feedback loop of their own making. The powerful propaganda machine flooded out rational voices, said Ms. Dong of Tsinghua University. The tech boom fits perfectly into Beijingâs grand narrative of a national rejuvenation. Innovation and entrepreneurship are top national policies, with enormous financial backing from the government. Even now, some articles critical of Chinaâs lagging semiconductor industry have disappeared from the internet there.
And it wasnât just Chinese people. Michael Moritz, the American venture capital investor, warned that China âis leaving Donald Trumpâs America behind.â Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, wondered how long it would take for China to overtake the United States. Three to four years, he concluded.
[Video: A Hoover Institution talk this year in which Peter Thiel discussed China. Watch on YouTube.]
The boom kept many from asking hard questions. They promoted Chinaâs surge in patent filings without looking at whether the patents were any good. They didnât ask why China still imports 90 percent of its semiconductor components even though the industry became a national priority in 2000.
The tone has changed. At an annual conference of top venture capitalists in Shanghai in late April, several major investors admitted that too much money went to start-ups that could go public quickly. Few want to fund the hard work that requires long-term research and development. Now, those investors face some of the blame.
âThe public is saying that investors are bastards,â said Ni Zewang, chairman of one of Chinaâs top venture firms, Shenzhen Capital Group, according to the conference transcript.
Allen Zhu, who became famous for investing in star start-ups, including the ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology and the bike-sharing app Ofo, said he invested in a few chip start-ups years ago but lost his money. âFor investors, the ratio of investment to returns isnât proportionate,â he said.
Thanks to the ZTE incident, that problem has gone away.
Albert Liu, chief executive of the chip start-up Kneron, says that in the past, only one of four investors he met with would express any interest in his company. But when he had a round of meetings with 50 investors in May, nine of 10 were interested.
He used to have to spend a lot of time explaining why chips are important in the age of artificial intelligence. Now, he says, investors will tell him: âLetâs skip this. I know why.â
Some Chinese companies are doubling their efforts to develop their own chips. Gree Electric Appliances of Zhuhai, the worldâs biggest residential air-conditioner manufacturer, started building its own chips for air-conditioners three years ago in an attempt to lower costs and better control its supply chain.
âAfter the ZTE incident, we realize how important it is to be able to make chips on our own,â says Tang Xiaohui, a senior executive in charge of Greeâs smartphone and chip development. The companyâs chairwoman announced on state television recently that Gree would spend $7.8 billion on chip research and development in the next three years.
The chipsets Gree develops may not be as good as the American ones, Mr. Tang said. âBut weâve got to have a Plan B.â

"As Trump Escalates Trade Fight, China Can Take the Hit","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2056823170?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI â Thanks to President Trumpâs tariffs, Americans will soon be paying more for a wide variety of Chinese-made goods, and some American customers may end up buying from other countries instead.
For now, China can live with that.
The tariffs the White House announced on Friday will have little immediate impact on China, despite the size of the $50 billion in goods involved and the invective the move set off from Chinese official news media. Mr. Trumpâs tariffs are ultimately too small and narrowly targeted to seriously affect Chinaâs nearly $13 trillion economy, which no longer depends so much on exports and can easily find other places besides the United States to sell its products. In some ways, they are even smaller than tariffs imposed by previous presidents.
The tariffs could spread, of course. Mr. Trump escalated his trade fight with China on Monday, saying the administration would identify another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that could face 10 percent tariffs. The president criticized Chinaâs actions, saying it was determined to keep the United States âat a permanent and unfair disadvantage.â The question is whether Mr. Trump will make good on his threats.
China could retaliate with its own tariffs on the United Statesâ far smaller exports in the other direction across the Pacific. Plus, it could impose punitive measures against American companies doing business here.
Any measures carry the risk that they could disrupt the global supply chain in sudden and unexpected ways, or could damage confidence among investors in building factories and other businesses in either country. Already there are signs of strains in the global economy from the broader trade tensions, weakness that China and the United States are both better positioned to weather than other nations.
Still, the absence of immediate impact could also give both sides breathing room to calm down.
Each has its reasons for ducking a fight. The United States may need Chinaâs help to keep its uneasy peace with North Korea. Beijing has stickier issues, like breaking the countryâs addiction to debt-fueled economic growth without hurting growth. Already some indicators show signs of a slowdown, though if it worsens significantly Beijing may find Mr. Trumpâs tariffs could make a convenient scapegoat.
China in particular risks being distracted. Its point person on tackling debt, a senior economic official named Liu He, has also been deeply involved in trade negotiations, though Chinese officials say Beijing has the bandwidth to handle both.
âThe strain on the top leadership as it tries to fend off a trade war with the U.S. as well as de-risk Chinaâs financial sector is considerable,â said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist with Enodo Economics, a London research firm specializing in China. âThey cannot afford to drop the ball on either front.â
For both sides, the issue has become far more than a struggle over nuts-and-bolts economics. It has become a battle over which country will dominate the high-wage, high-skill industries of tomorrow. Washington and Beijing alike see those industries as essential to protecting national security and to creating jobs.
The Trump administration is pushing hard for curbs on Chinaâs $300 billion government program to bolster these industries, called Made in China 2025. Beijing aims to make the country a leader in the manufacturing of advanced products, including computer microchips and commercial aircraft. The Trump administrationâs statement announcing tariffs managed to mention the Chinese industrial policy program no fewer than five times.
But China appears just as determined to preserve the program. And the trade issue has become so high profile that the Chinese public has come to expect that Beijing will push back hard against the Trump administrationâs trade measures.
âThis pressure will be high,â said Tu Xinquan, the director of the China Institute of World Trade Organization Studies in Beijing. âThere is no way to move back.â
While the American tariffs could hurt specific Chinese industries, they will probably do little to hit Chinaâs overall growth.
Under the tariffs announced on Friday, American buyers must pay 25 percent of the wholesale cost of Chinese-made goods when they hit American docks. The tariffs will ultimately be levied on $50 billion worth of Chinese exports, including electric cars and aircraft navigational equipment.
While $50 billion sounds like a lot, that represents just 0.4 percent of the Chinese economy. The details suggest the impact may be even less.
The tariff level, 25 percent, is fairly small compared with those imposed by previous presidents. President Barack Obama put a 35 percent penalty on Chinese-made car - and light-truck tires during his first year in office, President George W. Bush imposed rates of as much as 30 percent on imported steel during his second year in office, while President Ronald Reagan imposed a 100 percent toll on some Japanese electronics near the end of his second term. All those were eventually dropped.
Some American buyers of Chinese goods may simply choose to pay the newly imposed tariffs rather than find new suppliers elsewhere. Brad Setser, a Treasury official in the Obama administration who is now an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that Chinaâs exports to the United States in the affected categories could easily be halved by the tariffs. But they would not disappear entirely, as some Chinese products would still be competitive in terms of cost.
Some of the same goods could probably be sold to other countries at slightly lower prices, further limiting the effect on the Chinese economy, Mr. Setser said.
Moreover, Chinaâs exports could grow in other areas to offset any drop. Its exports to the United States are already increasing by more than $50 billion each year, and more than 90 percent of Chinaâs exports to the United States are not covered by the tariffs.
âEven with tariffs on one-tenth of total imports from China, overall imports from China would likely rise,â Mr. Setser said.
The tariffs could have a longer-term effect on China, however.
Devised as essentially a pre-emptive strike against Chinese subsidies in the Made in China 2025 program, the Trump tariffs could limit eventual sales from these industries. And with the European Union also protesting the Made in China 2025 program, those exports to Europe could suffer, too.
Longer term, the tariffs could spur American companies to move their factories elsewhere. But companies have been reluctant so far to move, as Chinaâs world-class transportation system and well-trained work force still make it highly competitive in all but the lowest-skill, lowest-wage industries.
On the flip side, the tariffs could help the Chinese government take the heat if the broader economy starts to falter. The economy could slow further as Beijing intensifies debt reduction efforts. Chinese leaders could blame Washington for the slowdown instead.
While American and European business have long criticized China for not living up to its promises on trade, Chinese officials point to significant moves to free up its limits on foreign businesses since Mr. Trump was elected. These include the removal of what had been a 25 percent limit on foreign investment in Chinese banks. China also plans to lower its tariffs on imported cars.
âTheyâve done the things they said,â said Andrew Polk, a co-founder of Trivium/China, a Beijing economic consulting firm. âYouâve got to give them that.â

How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2059657501?accountid=14586,"HAMBANTOTA, Sri Lanka â Every time Sri Lankaâs president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, turned to his Chinese allies for loans and assistance with an ambitious port project, the answer was yes.
Yes, though feasibility studies said the port wouldnât work. Yes, though other frequent lenders like India had refused. Yes, though Sri Lankaâs debt was ballooning rapidly under Mr. Rajapaksa.
Over years of construction and renegotiation with China Harbor Engineering Company, one of Beijingâs largest state-owned enterprises, the Hambantota Port Development Project distinguished itself mostly by failing, as predicted. With tens of thousands of ships passing by along one of the worldâs busiest shipping lanes, the port drew only 34 ships in 2012.
And then the port became Chinaâs.
Mr. Rajapaksa was voted out of office in 2015, but Sri Lankaâs new government struggled to make payments on the debt he had taken on. Under heavy pressure and after months of negotiations with the Chinese, the government handed over the port and 15,000 acres of land around it for 99 years in December.
The transfer gave China control of territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of a rival, India, and a strategic foothold along a critical commercial and military waterway.
The case is one of the most vivid examples of Chinaâs ambitious use of loans and aid to gain influence around the world â and of its willingness to play hardball to collect.
The debt deal also intensified some of the harshest accusations about President Xi Jinpingâs signature Belt and Road Initiative: that the global investment and lending program amounts to a debt trap for vulnerable countries around the world, fueling corruption and autocratic behavior in struggling democracies.
Months of interviews with Sri Lankan, Indian, Chinese and Western officials and analysis of documents and agreements stemming from the port project present a stark illustration of how China and the companies under its control ensured their interests in a small country hungry for financing.
â¢ During the 2015 Sri Lankan elections, large payments from the Chinese port construction fund flowed directly to campaign aides and activities for Mr. Rajapaksa, who had agreed to Chinese terms at every turn and was seen as an important ally in Chinaâs efforts to tilt influence away from India in South Asia. The payments were confirmed by documents and cash checks detailed in a government investigation seen by The New York Times.
â¢ Though Chinese officials and analysts have insisted that Chinaâs interest in the Hambantota port is purely commercial, Sri Lankan officials said that from the start, the intelligence and strategic possibilities of the portâs location were part of the negotiations.
â¢ Initially moderate terms for lending on the port project became more onerous as Sri Lankan officials asked to renegotiate the timeline and add more financing. And as Sri Lankan officials became desperate to get the debt off their books in recent years, the Chinese demands centered on handing over equity in the port rather than allowing any easing of terms.
â¢ Though the deal erased roughly $1 billion in debt for the port project, Sri Lanka is now in more debt to China than ever, as other loans have continued and rates remain much higher than from other international lenders.
Mr. Rajapaksa and his aides did not respond to multiple requests for comment, made over several months, for this article. Officials for China Harbor also would not comment.
Estimates by the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry paint a bleak picture: This year, the government is expected to generate $14.8 billion in revenue, but its scheduled debt repayments, to an array of lenders around the world, come to $12.3 billion.
âJohn Adams said infamously that a way to subjugate a country is through either the sword or debt. China has chosen the latter,â said Brahma Chellaney, an analyst who often advises the Indian government and is affiliated with the Center for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi.
Indian officials, in particular, fear that Sri Lanka is struggling so much that the Chinese government may be able to dangle debt relief in exchange for its militaryâs use of assets like the Hambantota port â though the final lease agreement forbids military activity there without Sri Lankaâs invitation.
âThe only way to justify the investment in Hambantota is from a national security standpoint â that they will bring the Peopleâs Liberation Army in,â said Shivshankar Menon, who served as Indiaâs foreign secretary and then its national security adviser as the Hambantota port was being built.
An Engaged Ally
The relationship between China and Sri Lanka had long been amenable, with Sri Lanka an early recognizer of Maoâs Communist government after the Chinese Revolution. But it was during a more recent conflict â Sri Lankaâs brutal 26-year civil war with ethnic Tamil separatists â that China became indispensable.
Mr. Rajapaksa, who was elected in 2005, presided over the last years of the war, when Sri Lanka became increasingly isolated by accusations of human rights abuses. Under him, Sri Lanka relied heavily on China for economic support, military equipment and political cover at the United Nations to block potential sanctions.
The war ended in 2009, and as the country emerged from the chaos, Mr. Rajapaksa and his family consolidated their hold. At the height of Mr. Rajapaksaâs tenure, the president and his three brothers controlled many government ministries and around 80 percent of total government spending. Governments like China negotiated directly with them.
So when the president began calling for a vast new port development project at Hambantota, his sleepy home district, the few roadblocks in its way proved ineffective.
From the start, officials questioned the wisdom of a second major port, in a country a quarter the size of Britain and with a population of 22 million, when the main port in the capital was thriving and had room to expand. Feasibility studies commissioned by the government had starkly concluded that a port at Hambantota was not economically viable.
âThey approached us for the port at the beginning, and Indian companies said no,â said Mr. Menon, the former Indian foreign secretary. âIt was an economic dud then, and itâs an economic dud now.â
But Mr. Rajapaksa greenlighted the project, then boasted in a news release that he had defied all caution â and that China was on board.
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority began devising what officials believed was a careful, economically sound plan in 2007, according to an official involved in the project. It called for a limited opening for business in 2010, and for revenue to be coming in before any major expansion.
The first major loan it took on the project came from the Chinese governmentâs Export-Import Bank, or Exim, for $307 million. But to obtain the loan, Sri Lanka was required to accept Beijingâs preferred company, China Harbor, as the portâs builder, according to a United States Embassy cable from the time, leaked to WikiLeaks.
That is a typical demand of China for its projects around the world, rather than allowing an open bidding process. Across the region, Beijingâs government is lending out billions of dollars, being repaid at a premium to hire Chinese companies and thousands of Chinese workers, according to officials across the region.
There were other strings attached to the loan, as well, in a sign that China saw strategic value in the Hambantota port from the beginning.
Nihal Rodrigo, a former Sri Lankan foreign secretary and ambassador to China, said that discussions with Chinese officials at the time made it clear that intelligence sharing was an integral, if not public, part of the deal. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Rodrigo characterized the Chinese line as, âWe expect you to let us know who is coming and stopping here.â
In later years, Chinese officials and the China Harbor company went to great lengths to keep relations strong with Mr. Rajapaksa, who for years had faithfully acquiesced to such terms.
In the final months of Sri Lankaâs 2015 election, Chinaâs ambassador broke with diplomatic norms and lobbied voters, even caddies at Colomboâs premier golf course, to support Mr. Rajapaksa over the opposition, which was threatening to tear up economic agreements with the Chinese government.
As the January election inched closer, large payments started to flow toward the presidentâs circle.
At least $7.6 million was dispensed from China Harborâs account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksaâs campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation. The document details China Harborâs bank account number â ownership of which was verified â and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out.
With 10 days to go before polls opened, around $3.7 million was distributed in checks: $678,000 to print campaign T-shirts and other promotional material and $297,000 to buy supporters gifts, including womenâs saris. Another $38,000 was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting Mr. Rajapaksaâs electoral bid, while two checks totaling $1.7 million were delivered by volunteers to Temple Trees, his official residence.
Most of the payments were from a subaccount controlled by China Harbor, named âHPDP Phase 2,â shorthand for Hambantota Port Development Project.
Chinaâs Network
After nearly five years of helter-skelter expansion for Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative across the globe, Chinese officials are quietly trying to take stock of how many deals have been done and what the countryâs financial exposure might be. There is no comprehensive picture of that yet, said one Chinese economic policymaker, who like many other officials would speak about Chinese policy only on the condition of anonymity.
Some Chinese officials have become concerned that the nearly institutional graft surrounding such projects represents a liability for China, and raises the bar needed for profitability. President Xi acknowledged the worry in a speech last year, saying, âWe will also strengthen international cooperation on anticorruption in order to build the Belt and Road Initiative with integrity.â
In Bangladesh, for example, officials said in January that China Harbor would be banned from future contracts over accusations that the company attempted to bribe an official at the ministry of roads, stuffing $100,000 into a box of tea, government officials said in interviews. And China Harborâs parent company, China Communications Construction Company, was banned for eight years in 2009 from bidding on World Bank projects because of corrupt practices in the Philippines.
Since the port seizure in Sri Lanka, Chinese officials have started suggesting that Belt and Road is not an open-ended government commitment to finance development across three continents.
âIf we cannot manage the risk well, the Belt and Road projects cannot go far or well,â said Jin Qi, the chairwoman of the Silk Road Fund, a large state-owned investment fund, during the China Development Forum in late March.
In Sri Lankaâs case, port officials and Chinese analysts have also not given up the view that the Hambantota port could become profitable, or at least strengthen Chinaâs trade capacity in the region.
Ray Ren, China Merchant Portâs representative in Sri Lanka and the head of the Hambantota portâs operations, insisted that âthe location of Sri Lanka is ideal for international trade.â And he dismissed the negative feasibility studies, saying they were done many years ago when Hambantota was âa small fishing hamlet.â
Hu Shisheng, the director of South Asia studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that China clearly recognized the strategic value of the Hambantota port. But he added: âOnce China wants to exert its geostrategic value, the strategic value of the port will be gone. Big countries cannot fight in Sri Lanka â it would be wiped out.â
Although the Hambantota port first opened in a limited way in 2010, before the Belt and Road Initiative was announced, the Chinese government quickly folded the project into the global program.
Shortly after the handover ceremony in Hambantota, Chinaâs state news agency released a boastful video on Twitter, proclaiming the deal âanother milestone along the path of #BeltandRoad.â
A Port to Nowhere
The seaport is not the only grand project built with Chinese loans in Hambantota, a sparsely populated area on Sri Lankaâs southeastern coast that is still largely overrun by jungle.
A cricket stadium with more seats than the population of Hambantotaâs district capital marks the skyline, as does a large international airport â which in June lost the only daily commercial flight it had left when FlyDubai airline ended the route. A highway that cuts through the district is traversed by elephants and used by farmers to rake out and dry the rice plucked fresh from their paddies.
Mr. Rajapaksaâs advisers had laid out a methodical approach to how the port might expand after opening, ensuring that some revenue would be coming in before taking on much more debt.
But in 2009, the president had grown impatient. His 65th birthday was approaching the following year, and to mark the occasion he wanted a grand opening at the Hambantota port â including the beginning of an ambitious expansion 10 years ahead of the Port Authorityâs original timeline.
Chinese laborers began working day and night to get the port ready, officials said. But when workers dredged the land and then flooded it to create the basin of the port, they had not taken into account a large boulder that partly blocked the entrance, preventing the entry of large ships, like oil tankers, that the portâs business model relied on.
Ports Authority officials, unwilling to cross the president, quickly moved ahead anyway. The Hambantota port opened in an elaborate celebration on Nov. 18, 2010, Mr. Rajapaksaâs birthday. Then it sat waiting for business while the rock blocked it.
China Harbor blasted the boulder a year later, at a cost of $40 million, an exorbitant price that raised concerns among diplomats and government officials. Some openly speculated about whether the company was simply overcharging or the price tag included kickbacks to Mr. Rajapaksa.
By 2012, the port was struggling to attract ships â which preferred to berth nearby at the Colombo port â and construction costs were rising as the port began expanding ahead of schedule. The government decreed later that year that ships carrying car imports bound for Colombo port would instead offload their cargo at Hambantota to kick-start business there. Still, only 34 ships berthed at Hambantota in 2012, compared with 3,667 ships at the Colombo port, according to a Finance Ministry annual report.
âWhen I came to the government, I called the minister of national planning and asked for the justification of Hambantota Port,â Harsha de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, said in an interview. âShe said, âWe were asked to do it, so we did it.â â
Determined to keep expanding the port, Mr. Rajapaksa went back to the Chinese government in 2012, asking for $757 million.
The Chinese agreed again. But this time, the terms were much steeper.
The first loan, at $307 million, had originally come at a variable rate that usually settled above 1 or 2 percent after the global financial crash in 2008. (For comparison, rates on similar Japanese loans for infrastructure projects run below half a percent.)
But to secure fresh funding, that initial loan was renegotiated to a much higher 6.3 percent fixed rate. Mr. Rajapaksa acquiesced.
The rising debt and project costs, even as the port was struggling, handed Sri Lankaâs political opposition a powerful issue, and it campaigned heavily on suspicions about China. Mr. Rajapaksa lost the election.
The incoming government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, came to office with a mandate to scrutinize Sri Lankaâs financial deals. It also faced a daunting amount of debt: Under Mr. Rajapaksa, the countryâs debt had increased threefold, to $44.8 billion when he left office. And for 2015 alone, a $4.68 billion payment was due at yearâs end.
Signing It Away
The new government was eager to reorient Sri Lanka toward India, Japan and the West. But officials soon realized that no other country could fill the financial or economic space that China held in Sri Lanka.
âWe inherited a purposefully run-down economy â the revenues were insufficient to pay the interest charges, let alone capital repayment,â said Ravi Karunanayake, who was finance minister during the new governmentâs first year in office.
âWe did keep taking loans,â he added. âA new government canât just stop loans. Itâs a relay; you need to take them until economic discipline is introduced.â
The Central Bank estimated that Sri Lanka owed China about $3 billion last year. But Nishan de Mel, an economist at VeritÃ© Research, said some of the debts were off government books and instead registered as part of individual projects. He estimated that debt owed to China could be as much as $5 billion and was growing every year. In May, Sri Lanka took a new $1 billion loan from China Development Bank to help make its coming debt payment.
Government officials began meeting in 2016 with their Chinese counterparts to strike a deal, hoping to get the port off Sri Lankaâs balance sheet and avoid outright default. But the Chinese demanded that a Chinese company take a dominant equity share in the port in return, Sri Lankan officials say â writing down the debt was not an option China would accept.
When Sri Lanka was given a choice, it was over which state-owned company would take control: either China Harbor or China Merchants Port, according to the final agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, although it was never released publicly in full.
China Merchants got the contract, and it immediately pressed for more: Company officials demanded 15,000 acres of land around the port to build an industrial zone, according to two officials with knowledge of the negotiations. The Chinese company argued that the port itself was not worth the $1.1 billion it would pay for its equity â money that would close out Sri Lankaâs debt on the port.
Some government officials bitterly opposed the terms, but there was no leeway, according to officials involved in the negotiations. The new agreement was signed in July 2017, and took effect in December.
The deal left some appearance of Sri Lankan ownership: Among other things, it created a joint company to manage the portâs operations and collect revenue, with 85 percent owned by China Merchants Port and the remaining 15 percent controlled by Sri Lankaâs government.
But lawyers specializing in port acquisitions said Sri Lankaâs small stake meant little, given the leverage that China Merchants Port retained over board personnel and operating decisions. And the government holds no sovereignty over the portâs land.
When the agreement was initially negotiated, it left open whether the port and surrounding land could be used by the Chinese military, which Indian officials asked the Sri Lankan government to explicitly forbid. The final agreement bars foreign countries from using the port for military purposes unless granted permission by the government in Colombo.
That clause is there because Chinese Navy submarines had already come calling to Sri Lanka.
Strategic Concerns
China had a stake in Sri Lankaâs main port as well: China Harbor was building a new terminal there, known at the time as Colombo Port City. Along with that deal came roughly 50 acres of land, solely held by the Chinese company, that Sri Lanka had no sovereignty on.
That was dramatically demonstrated toward the end of Mr. Rajapaksaâs term, in 2014. Chinese submarines docked at the harbor the same day that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was visiting Colombo, in what was seen across the region as a menacing signal from Beijing.
When the new Sri Lankan government came to office, it sought assurances that the port would never again welcome Chinese submarines â of particular concern because they are difficult to detect and often used for intelligence gathering. But Sri Lankan officials had little real control.
Now, the handover of Hambantota to the Chinese has kept alive concerns about possible military use â particularly as China has continued to militarize island holdings around the South China Sea despite earlier pledges not to.
Sri Lankan officials are quick to point out that the agreement explicitly rules out Chinaâs military use of the site. But others also note that Sri Lankaâs government, still heavily indebted to China, could be pressured to allow it.
And, as Mr. de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, put it, âGovernments can change.â
Now, he and others are watching carefully as Mr. Rajapaksa, Chinaâs preferred partner in Sri Lanka, has been trying to stage a political comeback. The former presidentâs new opposition party swept municipal elections in February. Presidential elections are coming up next year, and general elections in 2020.
Although Mr. Rajapaksa is barred from running again because of term limits, his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former defense secretary, appears to be readying to take the mantle.
âIt will be Mahinda Rajapaksaâs call. If he says itâs one of the brothers, that person will have a very strong claim,â said Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the central bank governor under Mr. Rajapaksaâs government, who still advises the family. âEven if heâs no longer the president, as the Constitution is structured, Mahinda will be the main power base.â

"From a Space Station in Argentina , China Expands Its Reach in Latin America","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2078849203?accountid=14586,"QUINTUCO, Argentina â The giant antenna rises from the desert floor like an apparition, a gleaming metal tower jutting 16 stories above an endless wind-whipped stretch of Patagonia.
The 450-ton device, with its hulking dish embracing the open skies, is the centerpiece of a $50 million satellite and space mission control station built by the Chinese military.
The isolated base is one of the most striking symbols of Beijingâs long push to transform Latin America and shape its future for generations to come â often in ways that directly undermine the United Statesâ political, economic and strategic power in the region.
The station began operating in March, playing a pivotal role in Chinaâs audacious expedition to the far side of the moon â an endeavor that Argentine officials say they are elated to support.
But the way the base was negotiated â in secret, at a time when Argentina desperately needed investment â and concerns that it could enhance Chinaâs intelligence-gathering capabilities in the Western Hemisphere have set off a debate in Argentina about the risks and benefits of being pulled into Chinaâs orbit.
âBeijing has transformed the dynamics of the region, from the agendas of its leaders and businessmen to the structure of its economies, the content of its politics and even its security dynamics,â said R. Evan Ellis, a professor of Latin American studies at the United States Army War College.
For much of the past decade, the United States has paid little attention to its backyard in the Americas. Instead, it declared a pivot toward Asia, hoping to strengthen economic, military and diplomatic ties as part of the Obama administrationâs strategy to constrain China.
Since taking office, the Trump administration has retreated from that approach in some fundamental ways, walking away from a free trade pact with Pacific nations, launching a global trade war and complaining about the burden of Washingtonâs security commitments to its closest allies in Asia and other parts of the world.
All the while, China has been discreetly carrying out a far-reaching plan of its own across Latin America. It has vastly expanded trade, bailed out governments, built enormous infrastructure projects, strengthened military ties and locked up tremendous amounts of resources, hitching the fate of several countries in the region to its own.
China made its intentions clear enough back in 2008. In a first-of-its-kind policy paper that drew relatively little notice at the time, Beijing argued that nations in Latin America were âat a similar stage of developmentâ as China, with much to gain on both sides.
Leaders in the region were more than receptive. The primacy over Latin America that Washington had largely taken for granted since the end of the Cold War was being challenged by a cadre of leftist presidents who governed much of the region â including Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay and Bolivia â and wanted a more autonomous region.
Beijingâs invitation came at a fortuitous time: during the height of the financial crisis. Latching onto Chinaâs voracious appetite for the regionâs oil, iron, soybeans and copper ended up shielding Latin America from the worst of the global economic damage.
Then, as the price of oil and other commodities tanked in 2011, several countries in the region suddenly found themselves on shaky ground. Once again, China came to their aid, striking deals that further cemented its role as a central player in Latin America for decades.
Even with parts of Latin America shifting to the right politically in recent years, its leaders have tailored their policies to fulfill Chinaâs demand. Now Beijingâs dominance in much of the region â and what it means for Americaâs waning stature â is starting to come into sharp focus.
âItâs a fait accompli,â said Diego Guelar, Argentinaâs ambassador to China.
Back in 2013, he published a book with an alarming-sounding title: âThe Silent Invasion: The Chinese Landing in South America.â
âItâs no longer silent,â Mr. Guelar said of Chinaâs incursion in the region.
Trade between China and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean reached $244 billion last year, more than twice what it was a decade earlier, according to Boston Universityâs Global Development Policy Center. Since 2015, China has been South Americaâs top trading partner, eclipsing the United States.
Perhaps more significantly, China has issued tens of billions of dollars in commodities-backed loans across the Americas, giving it claim over a large share of the regionâs oil â including nearly 90 percent of Ecuadorâs reserves â for years.
China has also made itself indispensable by rescuing embattled governments and vital state-controlled companies in countries like Venezuela and Brazil, willing to make big bets to secure its place in the region.
Here in Argentina, a nation that had been shut out of international credit markets for defaulting on about $100 billion in bonds, China became a godsend for then-President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner.
And while it was extending a helping hand, China began the secret negotiations that led to the satellite and space control station here in Patagonia.
Argentine officials say the Chinese have agreed not to use the base for military purposes. But experts contend that the technology on it has many strategic uses.
Frank A. Rose, an assistant secretary of state for arms control during the Obama administration, said he spent much of his time worrying about Chinaâs budding space program. American intelligence and defense officials watched with alarm as China developed sophisticated technology to jam, disrupt and destroy satellites in recent years, he said.
âThey are deploying these capabilities to blunt American military advantages, which are in many ways derived from space,â Mr. Rose said.
China is not alone in regarding space as a critical battlespace for future wars. Last month, the Trump administration announced it would create a sixth military branch devoted to space.
Antennas and other equipment that support space missions, like the kind China now has here in Patagonia, can increase Chinaâs intelligence-gathering capabilities, experts say.
âA giant antenna is like a giant vacuum cleaner,â said Dean Cheng, a former congressional investigator who studies Chinaâs national security policy. âWhat you are sucking up is signals, data, all sorts of things.â
Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said American military officials were assessing the implications of the Chinese monitoring station. Chinese officials declined requests for interviews about the base and their space program.
Beyond any strategic contest with the United States, some leaders in Latin America are now having doubts and regrets about their ties to China, worried that past governments have saddled their nations with enormous debt and effectively sold out their futures.
But Mr. Guelar argued that hitting the brakes on engagement with China would be shortsighted, particularly at a time when Washington has given up its longstanding role as the regionâs political and economic anchor.
âThere has been an abdicationâ of leadership by the United States, he said. âIt surrendered that role not because it lost it, but because it doesnât wish to take it on.â
âA Window to the Worldâ
The Argentine government was in crisis mode in 2009. Inflation was high. Billions of dollars in debt payments were coming due. Anger was swelling over the government, including its decision to nationalize $30 billion in private pension funds. And the worst drought in five decades was making the economic situation even more bleak.
Enter China, which stepped forward to brighten the outlook. First, it struck a $10.2 billion currency swap deal that helped stabilize the Argentine peso, and then promised to invest $10 billion to fix the nationâs dilapidated rail system.
In the middle of all this, China also dispatched a team to Argentina to discuss something that had nothing to do with currency fluctuations: Beijingâs ambitions in space.
The Chinese wanted a satellite-tracking hub on the other side of the globe before the launch of an expedition to the far side of the moon, which never faces the Earth.
If successful, the mission, scheduled to launch this year, will be a milestone in space exploration, potentially paving the way for the extraction of helium 3, which some scientists believe could provide a revolutionary clean source of energy.
China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, a division of the countryâs armed forces, settled on this windswept 494-acre patch in Argentinaâs NeuquÃ©n Province.
Flanked by mountains and far from population centers, the site offered an ideal vantage point for Beijing to monitor satellites and space missions around the clock.
FÃ©lix Clementino Menicocci, the secretary general of Argentinaâs National Space Activities Commission, a government agency, said the Chinese had pitched officials with promises of economic development and the prospect of enabling a history-making endeavor.
âTheyâve become major players in space in the span of a few years,â Mr. Menicocci said of Chinaâs space program.
After months of secret negotiations, NeuquÃ©n Province and the Chinese government signed a deal in November 2012, giving China the right to the land â rent free â for 50 years.
When provincial lawmakers caught wind of the project after construction was already underway, some were aghast. Betty Kreitman, a lawmaker in NeuquÃ©n at the time, said she was outraged that the Chinese military was being allowed to set up a base on Argentine soil.
âSurrendering sovereignty in your own country is shameful,â Ms. Kreitman said.
When she visited the construction site, she said, she pressed Chinese officials for answers but walked away feeling even more concerned.
âThis is a window to the world,â she recalled the Chinese supervisor at the site saying. âIt gave me chills. What do you do with a window to the world? Spy on reality.â
Rapid Growth, and Then Peril
The pitch was certainly not subtle, but then, it was never meant to be.
Chinaâs policy document on Latin America in 2008 promised governments in the region to âtreat each other as equals,â a clear reference to the asymmetric relationship between the United States and its neighbors in the hemisphere.
As âour relationship with the United States diminished, our relationship with China grew,â said Brazilâs former president, Dilma Rousseff, whose ties with the Obama administration suffered after revelations that American officials had spied on her, her inner circle and Brazilâs state-controlled oil company. âWe never felt that China had imperial designs on us.â
The new alliance paid off, helping propel Latin America to the kind of growth rates that Europe and the United States envied.
âLatin America won the China lottery,â said Kevin P. Gallagher, an economist at Boston University. âIt helped the region have its largest growth spurt since the 1970s.â
Yet, Mr. Gallagher said, the bounty came with significant peril. Industries like agriculture and mining are subject to the boom-and-bust cycles of commodity prices, which made relying on them too heavily a big gamble over the long term.
Sure enough, global commodity prices eventually tumbled. In July 2014, as several leftist leaders were presiding over distressed economies, China signaled even more ambitious plans for the region. At a summit meeting in Brazil, President Xi Jinping announced that Beijing aspired to raise annual trade with the region to $500 billion within a decade.
In an interview with journalists, Mr. Xi hailed the trust his government had built in Latin America by quoting a Chinese proverb: â A bosom buddy afar brings distant lands near.â
For emphasis, he quoted the Cuban national hero JosÃ© MartÃ­ and the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, and recited a line from the epic Argentine poem âMartÃ­n Fierroâ by JosÃ© HernÃ¡ndez: âBrothers be united because that is the first law.â
Soon, China took a step that startled the Pentagon. In October 2015, Chinaâs Defense Ministry hosted officials from 11 countries in Latin America for a 10-day forum on military logistics titled âStrengthening Mutual Understanding for Win-Win Cooperation.â
The meeting built on the ties China had been making with militaries in Latin America, including donating equipment to the Colombian military, Washingtonâs closest partner in the region.
Borrowing from the playbook the United States had used across the world, China organized joint training exercises, including unprecedented naval missions off the Brazilian coast in 2013 and the Chilean coast in 2014. Beijing has also invited a growing number of midcareer military officers from Latin America for career development in China.
The contacts have paved the way for China to start selling military equipment in Latin America, which had long regarded the United States defense industry as the gold standard, said Mr. Ellis, the War College scholar.
Venezuela has spent hundreds of millions on Chinese arms and matÃ©riel in recent years. Bolivia has bought tens of millions of dollarsâ worth of Chinese aircraft. Argentina and Peru have signed smaller deals.
Mr. Ellis said the Chinese had also probably pursued cooperation relationships with Latin American nations, with an eye toward any possible confrontation with the United States.
âChina is positioning itself in a world that is safe for the rise of China,â he said. âIf youâre talking about the 2049 world, from the perspective of Latin America, China will have unquestionably surpassed the United States on absolute power and size. Frankly, if it was a matter of sustained conflict, you reach a point where you canât deny the possibility of Chinese forces operating from bases in the region.â
Just weeks after the space station began operating in Patagonia, the United States made an announcement that raised eyebrows here in Argentina.
The Pentagon is funding a $1.3 million emergency response center in NeuquÃ©n â the same province where the Chinese base is, and the first such American project in all of Argentina. Local officials and residents wondered whether the move was a tit-for-tat response to Chinaâs new presence in this remote part of the country.
American officials said that the project was unrelated to the space station, and that the center would be staffed only by Argentines.
No Need for New âImperial Powersâ
Latin America experts in the Obama White House watched Chinaâs rise in the region warily. But the administration raised little fuss publicly, sharing its concerns with leaders mostly in private.
Besides, former officials say, Washington did not have much of a counteroffer.
âI wished the whole time I was working in Latin America that any administration had as well thought-out, resourced and planned a policy as the pivot to Asia for Latin America,â said John Feeley, who recently resigned as the American ambassador to Panama after a nearly three-decade career. âSince the end of the 1980s, there really has never been a comprehensive hemispheric long-term strategy.â
While President Barack Obama was widely hailed in the region for restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba in late 2014, Washingtonâs agenda never ceased being dominated by two issues that have long generated resentment in Latin America: the war on drugs and illegal immigration.
While the Trump administration has yet to articulate a clear policy for the hemisphere, it has warned its neighbors not to get too cozy with China. Former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson publicly cautioned that Latin America did not need new âimperial powers,â adding that China âis using its economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit; the question, is at what price?â
That question is being vigorously debated in some corners. Former President Rafael Correa of Ecuador was interrogated by prosecutors in February as part of an investigation into whether the decision to promise the countryâs crude reserves to China through 2024 harmed national interests.
In Bolivia, which has also seen a surge of Chinese investment, several industries have withered as Chinese products have become cheaper and easier to buy, said Samuel Doria Medina, a Bolivian businessman and politician who has run unsuccessfully against President Evo Morales three times.
âOur financial, commercial and, ultimately, political dependency keeps growing,â Mr. Doria said. Bolivia and several other leftist leaders who have tied their lot to China, he warned, have âmortgaged the futureâ of their nations.
Yet Chinaâs influence has not diminished, even as Latin America shifts to the right politically. In recent months, Beijing persuaded Panama and the Dominican Republic to sever ties with Taiwan, notable victories in one of Chinaâs foreign policy priorities.
Chinaâs clout, analyst say, is also a sign of how much the Trump administration has alienated governments in the region by adopting harsh immigration policies and pursuing hardball tactics on trade in a part of the world where Washington already has an ample surplus.
Jorge Arbache, the secretary for international affairs at Brazilâs Planning Ministry, said Washingtonâs âlack of predictabilityâ had prevented a more ambitious partnership from taking root, while China had been far clearer about its vision.
âEveryone expects China to become even more influential,â Mr. Arbache said.
âPeople Are Afraidâ
Soon after being nominated as Argentinaâs ambassador to China in late 2015, Mr. Guelar said, he steeled himself for an arduous task: pushing to renegotiate the space station agreement.
The former government, he said, had given away too much, recklessly failing to specify that the base could be used only for peaceful purposes.
âIt was very serious,â he said. âAt any moment it could become a military base.â
To his surprise, he said, the Chinese agreed to the use base solely for civilian purposes. But that did not assuage concerns in Bajada del Agrio, the closest town to the station, where residents speak of the Chinese presence with a mix of bewilderment and fear.
âPeople see it as a military base,â said Jara MarÃ­a Albertina, the manager at the local radio station. âPeople are afraid.â
The mayor, Ricardo FabiÃ¡n Esparza, said the Chinese had been friendly and even invited him to look at the images the antenna produces. But he is more apprehensive than hopeful.
âFrom that telescope, they probably can even see what underwear youâre wearing,â he said.
The United States is the one that should be most concerned, he said. The base, he said, is an âeye looking toward that country.â

Worries Grow in Singapore Over Chinaâs Calls to Help âMotherlandâ,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2084475365?accountid=14586,"SINGAPORE â Growing up in Singapore, Chan Kian Kuan always took pride in his Teochew heritage â the dialect, the cultural traditions and the famous steamed fish. But after visiting his ancestral village in Teochew, in Guangdong Province, China, and seeing the progress there, he became truly proud to be not just Teochew, but also Chinese.
âItâs very messy. We are Chinese, but we are Singaporean, too,â said Mr. Chan, vice president of the Teochew Poit Ip Clan Association in Singapore. âWhen China becomes stronger, we feel proud. China is like the big brother.â
As a young country made up mostly of immigrants, Singapore has for decades walked a fine line between encouraging citizens like Mr. Chan to connect with their cultural heritage and promoting a Singaporean national identity.
But there are growing concerns here that a rising China could tip that carefully orchestrated balance by seeking to convert existing cultural affinities among Singaporean Chinese into loyalty to the Chinese âmotherland.â
Confident in its fast-growing political and economic clout, China has become increasingly assertive in its efforts to appeal to the vast Chinese diaspora to serve the countryâs national interests and gain influence abroad. Already, there has been evidence of the Chinese Communist Partyâs attempts to manipulate political activity among Chinese populations in countries like Canada, the United States and Australia.
And with ethnic Chinese constituting nearly 75 percent of Singaporeâs population of 5.6 million, some scholars and former diplomats worry that this island nation could be an especially tantalizing target for the Chinese governmentâs influence efforts.
âFor us, it is an existential issue; the stakes are extremely high,â said Bilahari Kausikan, a former permanent secretary of Singaporeâs Ministry of Foreign Affairs and one of the most outspoken voices in the country on the subject of Chinese interference.
âChinaâs rise is a geopolitical fact that everyone must accept,â Mr. Kausikan said. âBut itâs a very small step in my mind from cultural affinity for China to the idea of Chinese superiority. We are only 53 years old. Itâs not guaranteed that every Singaporean Chinese would not be tempted either consciously or unconsciously to take that step.â
Last month Chinaâs ambassador to Singapore took the rare step of publicly rebutting recent remarks made by Mr. Kausikan in which he raised an alarm about what he called Chinaâs covert âinfluence operations.â
âWe uphold the principles of peaceful coexistence and champion global fairness and justice,â the ambassador, Hong Xiaoyong, wrote in an op-ed in The Straits Times, an English-language newspaper. âWe oppose the big bullying the small and interference in othersâ internal affairs. This is what China has said, and this is also what China has been doing.â
âChina respects Singaporeâs achievements in maintaining racial and religious harmony,â he added. âIt has no intention of influencing Singaporeansâ sense of their national identity and will never do so.â
One example of how on-edge Singaporean officials have been came to light last year when the government expelled Huang Jing, an American academic born in China, for what it said was his covert effort to influence Singaporeâs foreign policy on behalf of an unnamed foreign government â widely believed to be China. The expulsion came amid heightened tensions between Singapore and China over territorial issues relating to the South China Sea.
Mr. Kausikan and others are also concerned about Chinaâs subtler influence efforts in Singapore, including appeals to sentimental âflesh and bloodâ ties to China.
In recent years, China has stepped up people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, helping to organize conferences bringing together overseas Chinese, arranging visits for Singaporean Chinese to their ancestral villages and coordinating study abroad programs and âroots-seeking campsâ for young Singaporeans.
These kinds of programs are not unique to China, of course. The camps, for example, bear some similarity to Israelâs popular Birthright program. They are often arranged and paid for in part by Chinese government agencies like the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office.
In a description of one such camp held this year, participating Singaporean students were promised a full itinerary of activities including lessons in Chinese calligraphy and history. At another camp, in 2014, the schedule included learning the martial art of tai chi and singing Communist âredâ songs.
In recent years, officials affiliated with the Communist Partyâs United Front Work Department â a powerful Chinese agency responsible for winning hearts and minds abroad â have also visited Singapore with the aim of strengthening ties with the local Chinese.
âMy cellphone is on 24 hours a day,â Hong Guoping, then head of the United Front in the Xiangâan district in Fujian Province, told a group of Singaporean Chinese affiliated with that district in 2013. âMy fellow countrymen can call me at any time. Iâm happy to serve everyone.â
In a sign of the growing emphasis on building diaspora ties, it was announced this year that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office would come under the purview of the United Front Work Department.
âA more generous reading is that these are people-to-people exchanges,â said Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, âand a more skeptical reading is that itâs an effort by China to exert soft-power influence.â
Some scholars have highlighted what they call a worrying trend that has seen China increasingly blurring the distinction between huaqiao (Chinese citizens overseas) and huaren (ethnic Chinese of all nationalities).
At an overseas Chinese work conference last year, President Xi Jinping stressed the need to bring together people of Chinese descent around the world â up to 60 million ethnic Chinese in more than 180 countries â to enjoy the âChinese dream.â
âThe realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the joint efforts of Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad,â said Mr. Xi, according to Xinhua, Chinaâs state-run news agency.
Scholars say the focus on strengthening ties with overseas Chinese signals a major shift away from Beijingâs previous, more hands-off approach to diaspora relations.
âThere is a sense that the emphasis now is on how all ethnic Chinese share a similar origin and therefore should be more sympathetic to a P.R.C. perspective,â said Professor Chong, referring to the Peopleâs Republic of China.
In some Western countries, China has already successfully mobilized local groups like Chinese businessmen, Chinese students and Chinese-language media, using them as proxies to rally against anti-Chinese views or to whip up support for Beijingâs line on contentious issues like the Dalai Lama or Taiwan.
Frequently, the result has been a negative and often xenophobic anti-Chinese backlash. Many overseas Chinese have said they are now being unfairly subject to a cloud of suspicion simply for being associated with China.
âWhen you start reaching out to people on the basis of race and blood, it becomes unacceptable to other governments,â said Wang Gungwu, a former chairman of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore. âOn the other hand, Beijing thinks it is natural to do so. And that is where the conflict lies, however unintended the consequences may be.â
As the only country outside China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to have a majority-Chinese population, Singapore is in a unique position.
Wary of being seen as a fifth column of China, the country under Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew went out of its way after gaining independence in 1965 to assert its sovereignty â making it a point to be the last country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to establish diplomatic ties with China.
At the same time, the government sought to build a Singaporean national identity based on multiracialism, equality and meritocracy. English is the countryâs official working language.
But Singapore finds itself continually needing to remind officials in Beijing that it is not a Chinese country. Last year, for example, not long after China unveiled a gleaming new center to promote Chinese culture here, Singapore countered by opening a sprawling $110 million, 11-story Singapore Chinese Cultural Center in the heart of the financial district.
The message was clear: Singaporean Chinese culture is not the same as Chinese culture.
And Chinaâs efforts to gain influence in Singapore are by no means one way. Recognizing the economic potential after Chinaâs opening up in the 1980s, Singapore has also gone out of its way to play up its shared Chinese heritage.
In the late 1970s, for example, the government started a language campaign to encourage young Singaporean Chinese to learn Mandarin â Chinaâs official language â instead of their native Chinese dialects, with an eye to facilitating greater business opportunities. Every year, the country also hosts numerous performances by Chinese entertainers, particularly during the annual Chinese New Year celebrations.
Last year, Singapore was Chinaâs top foreign investor â a status many here proudly attribute to the countryâs ability to act as a gateway between China and the West.
âYou could say Singaporeans are even more proactive than the Chineseâ in building ties between the two countries, said Mr. Chan of the Teochow Poit Ip Clan Association.
Not everyone is convinced that China will succeed in winning the loyalty of Singaporean Chinese, which are a large and fragmented population.
Young Singaporean Chinese as well as those who studied in the countryâs former English education system, for example, often have only a vague notion of China and limited Chinese-speaking abilities. Then there is the large influx of immigrants from China in recent years, which has sharpened the perceived differences between the two countries.
âMaybe some people who go back to their ancestral village and see all the progress being made might feel their heartstrings being tugged, but at the end of the day, they would never look at it and think this is home,â said Pang Cheng Lian, the editor of the book â50 Years of the Chinese Community in Singapore.â
Then again, when it comes to strengthening its influence abroad, China has proved that it is both patient and persistent.
âThey are not eager to have immediate results,â said Leo Suryadinata, a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, âbecause Beijingâs view is always the long-term view.â

Trumpâs Tariffs Are Changing Trade With China. Here Are 2 Emerging Endgames.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2085866663?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â The United States and China have sparred repeatedly over trade, in a tit-for-tat skirmish that has shown little sign of abating. High-level talks have stalled, while both sides have been threatening further tariffs in recent days.
But beneath the acrimony, two potential paths for China seem to be emerging, according to participants in the trade negotiations and their advisers. Both would deliver trade wins for President Trump and his more moderate advisers, while also letting President Xi Jinping of China push ahead with his ambitious industrial plan to build national champions in cutting-edge technologies.
A stalemate appears the most likely endgame, with new American and Chinese tariffs staying in place for months or even years. So far, the United States has imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese technology goods and $3 billion of Chinese steel and aluminum, with another $16 billion in the offing. China has responded in kind, outlining its own plan on Wednesday for measures on $16 billion of American goods.
While the policies have drawn loud complaints from American companies that have become reliant on imports from China, they have been forcing multinationals to rethink their supply chains and start moving them away from China. Over time, such changes could reduce the trade deficit between the two countries and limit national security concerns, two big sources of discontent for Mr. Trump.
A negotiated truce is also possible. Although the two sides remain far apart, Beijing has made subtle shifts to a more conciliatory position. China now appears willing to discuss changes to its strategic plan, Made in China 2025, which the Trump administration has identified as a long-term threat to big American industries like aircraft manufacturing, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.
Chinaâs stance now is that a resolution of trade tensions must not block its further economic progress, but adjustments to Made in China 2025 could happen. The latest trade figures, which came out Wednesday, show that Chinese exports continue to surge, giving Beijing some confidence. âThe red line is Chinaâs right to develop, not the concrete industrial policies and measures regarding Made in China 2025,â said He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official who remains one of Chinaâs top trade experts.
To Mr. Trump and his aides, China is trade enemy No. 1. In making their case, they point to large, persistent trade deficits, as well as state-owned banks funding potential rivals to American giants in high tech and advanced manufacturing. They also worry that China is engaged in a rapid military buildup that would give Beijing ever more heft in Asia and around the world.
The tariffs address part of the presidentâs concerns, mainly by reducing American companiesâ dependency on Chinese suppliers.
Hundreds of Western companies already have been reconsidering Chinaâs role in their supply chains, according to several people involved in such decisions. Executives are increasingly looking for ways to transfer the final assembly of goods to factories outside China, mainly in low-wage countries elsewhere in Asia or in Mexico.
Doing the final assembly outside of China will allow companies to bypass the new American tariffs. It could also start to cut the deficit with China over the next couple years.
But these moves may not do much to the overall trade deficit of the United States, rearranging it instead to other countries. Companies are just relocating the last steps in production plans to places like Indonesia and Taiwan rather than bringing them back to the United States, where blue-collar labor is costly. Beijing will also retain a lot of leverage, given that the manufacturing of a long list of components, from wires and screws to electric motors and digital controls, will most likely remain in China.
Star Rapid, a company in Zhongshan, China, makes prototypes of products for more than 400 American companies in sectors like electronics, auto parts and medical devices. It has noticed that while many companies are looking at ways to change locations for final assembly, not one seems to be moving the production of entire supply chains. The components typically account for much if not most of the value in products.
âTheyâre not looking at taking it out of China,â said David Hunter, the companyâs chief executive. âTheyâre looking at where can they do the final transformation.â
During second-quarter conference calls by 192 American and European companies that mentioned tariffs, 17 percent of them said that they had already begun switching suppliers, according to an analysis by Panjiva, a trade data consulting firm. About 14 percent had begun moving some of their own operations.
The Trump administration can afford to stand firm. The American economy has been strong. And the tariffs that American companies face are more than offset by new tax cuts.
Washington may find it has other headaches if tariffs persist. Some China experts worry that the administrationâs trade stance could antagonize Chinese policymakers, pushing them toward a more confrontational approach on other issues.
They point out that President Xi has assigned the task of defusing a trade war to a team of fairly moderate, Western-educated officials. Failure to reach a deal could weaken these moderates and further embolden hard-liners who advocate continuing Chinaâs broad military buildup and its deployment of ever-harsher domestic security.
âWe really need to find a way to embrace China, and encourage the moderate voices here,â said James Zimmerman, a Beijing lawyer and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
Negotiating Made in China 2025 is more complicated. The Trump administration has called for Beijing to halt all subsidies to industries in the program, including low-cost loans from state-owned banks; accept that the United States will have some tariffs on these industries for reasons of national security; end cyberespionage aimed at stealing commercial secrets; and stop demanding that American companies share key technologies with Chinese companies.
While China is not willing to go nearly that far, it could offer some concessions that might provide an ostensible victory.
China has expressed a willingness to change parts of its industrial policy that violate global trade rules. But Chinaâs program falls into some gray areas.
While the World Trade Organization has many rules to prevent governments from subsidizing companies directly, the rules are more vague on whether a state-run banking system can provide preferential loans. Such loans have been the core of Chinese industrial policy for many years, and continue to be under Made in China 2025.
China has also begun exploring ways for Made in China 2025 to finance more research and development, instead of paying for the immediate construction of a lot of factories. World Trade Organization rules allow research subsidies.
The dilemma is whether any of these tweaks to Made in China 2025 would make much of a difference and appease the Trump administration.
China may also be signaling a willingness to compromise on tariffs. For much of the trade war, Beijing has matched Washington dollar for dollar on retaliatory measures. The United States and China will each have tariffs in place soon on roughly $50 billion of goods. For the United States, it amounts to a little less than one-tenth of imports from China. For China, it is about one-third of imports from the United States.
Last week, China shifted tack. Faced with American threats of tariffs on two-fifths of Chinaâs exports to the United States, or $200 billion a year, Beijing responded with a threat of tariffs on two-fifths of American exports to China, or $60 billion a year. The change raised the question of whether China might be willing to accept a compromise on tariffs linked to the share of total trade that is taxed in each direction.
China has not yet made any such offer, and on Wednesday the countryâs commerce ministry announced that it would keep pace with the Trump administrationâs next round of tariffs â on $16 billion of imports a year that are to take effect on Aug. 23.
Beijingâs more cautious approach to the greater threat, of tariffs on another $200 billion in annual imports, was also just practical: China does not even import that amount of goods from the United States annually.
âItâs just not a game changer,â Andrew Polk, a founder of Trivium, a Beijing consulting firm, said of the trade dispute. âThe trade war, as currently constituted, can go on for some time, and both economies can muddle through it without even strong effects.â

"Once a Cold War Flashpoint, a Part of Taiwan Embraces Chinaâs Pull","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2098814775?accountid=14586,"KINMEN COUNTY, Taiwan â The islands of Kinmen County, and the Nationalist troops stationed there, withstood artillery shelling from China long after the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war.
Today, relations between China and Kinmen, just miles apart, are very different indeed.
Kinmen, about twice the size of Manhattan, has been governed from Taiwan since the defeated Nationalists fled China for the islands in 1949. But Taiwanâs main island is 140 miles away, while China looms visibly in the near distance. That distance is narrowing â both literally and figuratively.
A new airport for the Chinese city of Xiamen is being built just north of Kinmen, on an island three miles away, and land reclamation for that project will bring Chinese territory almost a mile closer.
A proposed bridge to the Xiamen airport from Kinmen would essentially eliminate the remaining gap. Last month, China began supplying Kinmen with drinking water through a new 10-mile pipeline. And Kinmen will probably soon get cheaper electricity from its onetime enemy.
The Aug. 5 ceremony to open the pipeline underscored how much Kinmen, home to about 130,000 people, has been pulled into the orbit of China, whose ruling Communist Party has never controlled Taiwan and wants to annex it.
Liu Jieyi, the director of Beijingâs Taiwan Affairs Office, used his speech at the ceremony on the island to demand that self-governing, democratic Taiwan accept the âOne Chinaâ policy, which declares that Taiwan and China are part of the same country.
âThe vast populace of Taiwan will certainly make the correct choice,â Mr. Liu said.
He almost certainly wouldnât have made such a speech on Taiwanâs main island, where suspicion of China runs high. When Mr. Liuâs predecessor toured Taiwan in 2014, he was met with protests in multiple cities and his car was splashed with paint.
Wang Ting-yu, a Taiwanese lawmaker with the Democratic Progressive Party, said the freedom and democracy enjoyed in Kinmen made it unlikely that its residents would want to be part of authoritarian China. But he said Chinaâs ruling Communist Party had enjoyed some success on the island with so-called United Front tactics, under which it works with non-Communist groups to achieve its goals.
âAs far as bringing Kinmen closer to China, Iâd say at present it still looks doubtful,â Mr. Wang said, âbut you canât deny that the resources China has invested in United Front work in Kinmen have had a certain effect.â
Chen Fu-hai, the magistrate of Kinmen County, who shared the stage with Mr. Liu at the pipeline ceremony, said he wasnât concerned that the water supply would give China political leverage.
âI think China and Taiwan should have more interaction,â he said in an interview.
The new pipeline will provide Kinmen with 30 percent of its tap water, making up for strains on water supplies from growing Chinese tourism, environmental factors and the two sorghum liquor distilleries that provide most of the countyâs tax revenue.
On a recent hot afternoon at Kinmenâs Tianpo Reservoir, where the pipeline from China empties, Hong Yanming, a Kinmen resident, called the new water connection a âjoyous occasion for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.â She was taking photos with friends and family visiting from China.
Ms. Hong moved to Kinmen from China 24 years ago after marrying a local man. She is one of a few thousand Chinese women to have married Kinmenese men in the last three decades, one aspect of the growing ties between Kinmen and China. Many Kinmenese own property or do business in China.
She said her home village, Weitou, was next to the lake that is now feeding the reservoir here. âThere are about 40 women from Weitou village here in Kinmen,â she said. âIâm so happy â now we can all drink water from our hometown.â
As in mainland Taiwan, identity can be a complicated question for people born in Kinmen. The older generation tends to identify more as Chinese than Taiwanese, while younger people often view Chinaâs growing influence warily.
The island, along with adjacent Lesser Kinmen, was shelled sporadically by China from the 1950s through the late 1970s. It was heavily militarized and cut off even from mainland Taiwan until 1992, when martial law on Kinmen ended â five years later than in the rest of Taiwan â and residents participated in their first local elections.
Kinmen, unlike mainland Taiwan, did not spend half a century as a Japanese colony; it was a Chinese territory for most of that time. Such stark differences in their experiences, as well as the distance between the islands, have made the relationship awkward.
Tourists visiting Kinmen from mainland Taiwan might find it odd to hear a resident speak of âgoing to Taiwanâ for school or work, implying that Kinmen isnât part of Taiwan.
Many Kinmenese say theyâve been abandoned by Taipei, Taiwanâs capital, since the arrival of democracy. Mr. Chen, an independent politician who is Kinmenâs first elected magistrate not to be a member of the Nationalists, or Kuomintang, said none of Taiwanâs elected presidents had paid enough attention to the countyâs needs.
After Kinmenâs demilitarization in 1992, he said, âwe lacked water, we lacked electricity and we lacked roads â we had nothing.â
Economically, he said, Kinmen has largely had to fend for itself since then, relying primarily on sorghum liquor sales and, more recently, Chinese tourism. Ferry services to mainland China began in 2001, and Kinmenâs view of its giant neighbor has been softening since then.
âRight now, actually, I see the mainland as also being quite democratic, at least what Iâve seen in Xiamen,â Mr. Chen said of the booming Chinese city nearby. Asked to clarify that, he said he meant that the local government departments heâd met with had been âquite open.â
Lauren Dickey, a researcher at Kingâs College London who specializes in Beijing-Taiwan relations, said Chinaâs pull on Kinmen was only natural.
âIf the local government on Kinmen is not finding the central government in Taipei to be meeting its needs, then it is perhaps only logical that the Kinmen government would reach out to the geographically closest resources to ensure needs are met,â she said.
In the shadow of Xiamenâs urban buzz, much of Kinmenâs population has been hollowed out, with young people opting to move to the Taiwanese mainland or to China. Most of its photogenic traditional villages are only about one-third occupied, with many of the old courtyard homes in disrepair.
Some young people who have stayed say the political climate has changed.
Wang Ting-chi returned to Kinmen after six years in New York and founded a company, Local Methodology, to provide a nongovernmental platform for promoting Kinmen culture. She said she was concerned that Kinmenese felt like âorphansâ because of the distance from Taiwanâs main island, and that they might be tempted by overtures from an increasingly powerful China.
People who express concerns about Chinese influence, Ms. Wang said, are often dismissed as naÃ¯ve. âI think Kinmen is going off on its own to establish relations with China,â she said.

Trump Has Put the U.S. and China on the Cusp of a New Cold War,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2110055827?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â President Trump is confident that the United States is winning its trade war with China. But on both sides of the Pacific, a bleaker recognition is taking hold: The worldâs two largest economies are in the opening stages of a new economic Cold War, one that could persist well after Mr. Trump is out of office.
âThis thing will last long,â Jack Ma, the billionaire chairman of Alibaba Group, warned a meeting of investors on Tuesday in Hangzhou, China. âIf you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.â
Mr. Trump intensified his trade fight this week, imposing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatening to tax nearly all imports from China if it dared to retaliate. His position has bewildered, frustrated and provoked Beijing, which has responded with its own levies on American goods.
The diplomatic stalemate has many in the business and policy communities considering the possibility that the United States may be in a protracted and economically damaging trade fight for years to come and wondering what, if anything, America will gain.
Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia and an expert on China, said in an interview that 2018 signaled âthe beginnings of a war of a different type: a trade war, an investment war and a technology war between the two great powers of the 21st century, with an uncertain landing point.â
Signs of fallout were already apparent: Mr. Ma backed off a pledge he had made in a meeting with Mr. Trump last year to create one million jobs in the United States, telling the Chinese news site Xinhua that âthe promise was made on the premise of friendly U.S.-China partnership and rational trade relations,â a premise he said no longer exists. âTrade is not a weapon,â he said.
The latest tit-for-tat leaves little room for concessions, at least in the interim, as both countries dig in their heels and China tries to remain strong, despite an economic softening that Mr. Trump clearly sees as an opening to force Beijingâs hand.
Chinese growth in investment, factory production and consumer spending have all slowed this year, and its economic growth has slowed alongside. The situation is expected to worsen as effects of the escalating American tariffs ramp up.
While the United States made overtures toward China in recent days to talk trade in Washington this month, some officials said they now doubted Beijing would engage again at a high level until after the midterm elections in November, when President Xi Jinping may meet Mr. Trump on the sidelines of an economic summit meeting in Buenos Aires.
Mr. Trump himself seemed to dangle the prospect that he, and he alone, could broker a resolution that threatened to cause economic pain to companies and consumers on both sides of the Pacific.
âHopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection,â Mr. Trump said in his statement announcing the tariffs.
Yet it is not clear that either side will see a reason to back down. Aides to Mr. Trump say the president believes that the United States has the upper hand on China, with an ability to impose tariffs on a far larger number of goods than the Chinese can match given that America imports far more than it exports. And while the tariffs are unpopular with Republican lawmakers, farmers and manufacturers, his trade approach remains popular with his political base.
The Chinese side has its own political reasons to avoid capitulation. Acceding to Mr. Trump would be considered a sign of weakness for Mr. Xi, according to analysts.
And they see no sign that China is willing to give up on Made in China 2025, an industrial program that aims for dominance in robotics, artificial intelligence, and other high tech industries that have been the domain of the United States and Europe and that Mr. Trump has identified as a policy initiative that must be stopped.
While Chinese officials have expressed a willingness to get rid of the name Made in China 2025, they have been much more cautious about accepting limits on some of the crucial features of the countryâs industrial policy, like big loans from state-owned banks at very low interest rates to favored industries.
Inside the White House, there remains a pitched battle between those who want to make a deal with Beijing and those who are determined to keep piling on pressure to force a more radical change in its trade practices. At the moment, the hard liners have Mr. Trumpâs ear.
âYou would expect the administration to have tabled a negotiating text with a clear set of commitments, but that has apparently not been done,â said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. âThere are some in the administration who see tariffs as an end in themselves.â
Mr. Price said the Trump administration had done a good job of cataloging Chinaâs abuses: theft of intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from foreign companies, predatory joint venture agreements. But it has failed to marshal a coalition to confront China, instead provoking separate trade fights with the European Union, Japan, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatening additional taxes on imported cars.
âDoing this without the E.U. and Japan fully on board as though Chinese unfair trade practices were only a bilateral problem is wrongheaded and certainly less effective,â he said. âBut itâs very hard to galvanize your allies when you impose steel and aluminum tariffs on them and threaten auto tariffs.â
For China, a complicating factor is figuring out who has influence in Mr. Trumpâs White House. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been leading the negotiations, invited Chinaâs top trade negotiator, Liu He, to Washington for a meeting next week, even though his last visit ended badly when Mr. Trump spurned a deal that would have cut the American trade deficit with China.
Mr. Mnuchin believes the United States must be open to talks as long as China is willing to address structural issues, including the trade gap between what America exports and what it imports, pressure on American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition for doing business in China and intellectual property theft.
Other senior officials, notably Peter Navarro, who oversees the office of trade and manufacturing policy, have told colleagues that inviting the Chinese now was a sign of weakness. Mr. Navarro, an economist who made his name with book titles like âDeath by China,â is among those who favor putting more pressure on China to force a change in its behavior.
His office produced a compendious report in June called, âHow Chinaâs Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World.â In early May, he and Mr. Mnuchin clashed openly during a visit to Beijing after Mr. Mnuchin excluded him and other American officials from a private meeting with Mr. Liu.
It is not clear whether Mr. Liu will visit Washington next week. But even if he does, people who have spoken to Chinese officials said the unraveling of the agreement Mr. Liu believed he had struck on his last visit would make him reluctant to make any deal this time.
âThe Chinese deep learning from that is, âWe should not substantively re-engage until the administration has its internal house in order,ââ said Mr. Rudd, who is now the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.
After months of bruising encounters with Mr. Trump, Mr. Rudd said Chinese officials recognized that they would need to change their policies on trade and market access. But he said Mr. Xi was no less likely than Mr. Trump to risk losing face by giving in to American pressure.
âChina has politics too,â he said. âThe whole notion of âback downâ and âfaceâ is as live a consideration within internal Chinese politics as it is within U.S. politics.â
Mr. Trumpâs aggressive moves drew intense criticism from some quarters at home. Fred Smith, the chief executive of FedEx and an enthusiastic supporter of the presidentâs tax cuts, called his trade policy a form of mercantilism that was âworrisome to everyone.â
But Mr. Trump has shown little sign of changing course. While there are differences among members of his economic team, there is a broad consensus in the administration about taking a hawkish stance toward China. Some point to evidence that the trade pressure on China was making it less adventurous in the East China Sea, where it spars regularly with Japan.
Mr. Trump has forged ahead with tariffs even while saying that the trade tensions were making China less cooperative in pressuring North Korea on its nuclear arsenal â a claim that puzzles some of his own advisers.
âThey have been helpful; I hope theyâre still helpful,â Mr. Trump said at a news conference Tuesday with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda. âThereâs a question about that.â
But the president added, âIt got to a point where the numbers were too big.â China ârebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the United States,â he said. âAnd Iâve changed that around.â

"The Unlikely, Obvious Solution to the Trade War","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2111224691?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â The trade war really is on â counterproductive and unnecessary and yet likely to last. President Trumpâs new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods kick in on Monday, and he has threatened more. China had already retaliated with tariffs of its own. Now it has canceled high-level talks planned for this week.
Consumers and producers in both China and the United States will lose out. Chinaâs G.D.P. growth rate next year could drop by one percentage point or more. The impact on the United States economy is expected to be less severe but still substantial.
The stalemate also is unnecessary: There are better options to address the White Houseâs concerns â including by turning to the World Trade Organization (W.T.O.). The idea may seem like a nonstarter at the moment, but its appeal will increase as the conflict drags on.
Here are two great powers, roughly matched in resources, competing for technological and strategic supremacy. America is experiencing an economic upturn, and the Trump administration believes that it can weather any fallout from the standoff.
Chinaâs growth rate is declining and the country is more dependent on trade than the United States. But its government, being authoritarian, can more readily mobilize public support and make the country absorb short-term costs in the name of long-term development.
China complains that the United States government has been ambiguous in its requests or unreasonable in its proposals. Moderates in Washington, especially in the Treasury Department, have been trying to put forward more narrowly tailored requests for China to buy more American products (like natural gas), while reining in Chinese practices that violate intellectual property rights. But even their approach is fundamentally flawed.
It assumes that the Chinese government controls the quantity and type of American goods purchased in China, when there, as elsewhere, such decisions are mostly made by households and companies. Anyway, experts say, the United States canât produce enough goods to sell to the Chinese in order to close the bilateral trade gap.
Many of Americaâs standard accusations also are moot. Cyber-enabled commercial theft by the Chinese military, an issue under the Obama administration, no longer appears to be a significant problem. The charge that China uses joint ventures to force foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese entities is becoming less of a concern. According to 2016 data from Chinaâs National Bureau of Statistics, the latest available, joint ventures accounted for about one quarter of Chinaâs foreign investment flows in 2016, compared with nearly two-thirds in 1997.
The problems that the American government complains about are partly a matter of optics. What makes Chinaâs practices seem unfair is, at bottom, the role of the state in driving the economy and the scale of its activities. Together those factors appear to give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in negotiations with foreign companies, especially those eager to get into Chinaâs huge market.
But altering Chinaâs behavior on that front will require new international rules and some form of independent monitoring.
One obstacle, of course, is that Mr. Trump seems dead set against any such institution or arrangement. His administration has prematurely killed off the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as well as prospects for a bilateral investment treaty with China. And it is trying to do in the W.T.O.
It is blocking the appointment of new judges to the W.T.O. body that adjudicates trade disputes and threatening to withdraw from the organization itself â this even though America was instrumental in creating it in 1995 and has benefited greatly from its existence.
The Trump administration is also eroding W.T.O. rules by apparently violating them. It is invoking national security to apply punitive tariffs such as levies on steel â a move that China, the European Union and others are challenging.
China, for its part, has generally accepted the organizationâs rulings since joining it in 2001, despite being the target of a disproportionately large share of dumping charges. The W.T.O. has come down hard on China, and China has taken it, in other words, and that should be reason enough for the United States to work through the organization to resolve its issues with the Chinese government.
That said, the W.T.O. as currently structured cannot adequately deal with a state-driven economy like Chinaâs, as Mark Wu, a law professor at Harvard, has argued. Yes, China has cut back on directly subsidizing exports, a clear violation of W.T.O. guidelines. But many Chinese companies still benefit indirectly from access to underpriced state-owned land and privileged relations with local authorities and banks, and those issues are not explicitly covered in the regulations.
So the W.T.O. needs to be revamped and strengthened, including with new rules to clarify what constitutes noncommercial assistance to state-owned enterprises and what conditions governments can impose on foreign participation in joint ventures.
Enter Europe: It is uniquely positioned to lead such reforms thanks to its longstanding strategic alliance with the United States, its growing economic connections with China and its steadfast support for the W.T.O.
Economic links between the United States and China are pervasive, but those between Europe and China are deeper. The total of Europeâs investment flows to China were more than twice those of the United States between 2005 and 2016, according to United Nations agencies.
Like the United States, Europe is concerned about some of Chinaâs restrictive practices â for example, the fact that China limits foreign investment in its financial services, energy and communications sectors. But unlike the United States, the European Union isnât caught up in a great-power rivalry with China, and it is less concerned about the security implications of, say, Chinaâs efforts to develop semiconductors and aircraft.
So far, Europeâs leaders had been too preoccupied with their respective domestic concerns â Brexit, rising populist sentiments â to focus on reforming the global trading system. But Americaâs latest tariffs on China will hurt Europe, too, given Europeâs links with the Chinese economy. And just last week, the European Commission laid out a proposal for reforming the W.T.O., including new rules to deal with forced technology transfers and the rise of e-commerce.
If Europe develops a common understanding with China on how to revamp the organization, the option will become more difficult for the United States to ignore.
The Trump administration would, of course, need to change its current position. But shifting political and economic circumstances may give it a reason to. Whereas the vast majority of Republican respondents in a recent survey by the polling firm SurveyMonkey said they supported tariffs, many Republican political leaders do not. A victory by the Democrats, who mostly oppose tariffs, in the midterm elections could change the dynamics of the debate.
The White House could also point to any thorough overhaul of the W.T.O. as a victory, and an admission on Chinaâs part that the United Statesâ concerns were legitimate. It could then address any specific issues that remained in a bilateral investment treaty, which the U.S.-China Business Council has been advocating.
As the costs of this trade war add up in the United States, too, more rational minds may prevail in Washington. And they will see that the way out of the impasse runs through the W.T.O., whether Mr. Trump likes it or not.

China Is Confronting New U.S. Hostility. But Is It Ready for the Fight?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2111225128?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â The Chinese leader, wearing a dark Mao suit, and the American president, in a black tuxedo, stood side by side with arms aloft at the Kennedy Center. Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter smiled broadly as the orchestra played âGetting to Know You,â signaling the dawn of a new era of friendship and cooperation between their two nations.
Over the next 40 years, China and the United States built the most important economic relationship in the world and worked together on issues such as regional security, counterterrorism and climate change. Taking Mr. Dengâs lead, China played the junior partner, if not always deferential then at least soft-pedaling its ambitions and avoiding conflict with the much stronger United States.
Now, faster than many in either nation expected, that has all changed.
On Monday, the United States will begin taxing $200 billion in imports from China, the biggest round of tariffs to take effect yet in an escalating trade war. President Trump says the measures are necessary to fight an economic model that requires American companies to hand over technology in exchange for market access and provides state subsidies to Chinese competitors.
Chinaâs strongman leader, Xi Jinping, presiding over an economy gaining quickly on the United States, has openly challenged American leadership abroad while dashing hopes of any political thaw at home. During this time, both Republicans and Democrats in Washington have turned on Beijing, accusing it of imperial ambitions in Asia, aggression in disputed waters, persecution of ethnic minorities and unscrupulous trade policies aimed at dominating the industries of the future.
In a fundamental shift, the Trump administration has formally described China as a ârevisionist powerâ and âstrategic competitorâ in the past year. China has been saying similar things about the United States for even longer. But as relations have deteriorated in recent months, many Chinese are now asking if their country is really prepared to take on the worldâs most powerful nation.
China has abruptly canceled not only trade talks that were planned this week in Washington but also military-to-military talks scheduled to begin Tuesday. The latter move was made to protest American sanctions imposed last week on a Chinese military department for buying warplanes and missile equipment from Russia.
In a sign of Beijingâs growing international influence, though, the Vatican and the Chinese government said Saturday that they had reached a breakthrough agreement on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops in China, taking a step toward normalizing relations.
[Discuss Chinaâs role in the world with New York Times journalists in a new Facebook group here.]
As the acrimony and rivalry with the United States have intensified, the immediate worry in Beijing is how the Chinese public, accustomed to a fast-expanding economy, will handle the trade war, and what impact it might have on the ruling Communist Partyâs overriding concern of domestic stability.
The government has sought to project confidence.
âMaybe the growth rate will slow 1 percent. We can accept it. Thatâs not terrible for us,â said Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of The Global Times, a state-run newspaper known for its nationalist tone. He added that Washington would soon realize that its mobile phone and auto manufacturers could not survive without Chinese customers.
âAs long as our market is expanding economically and growing, China will win the trade war,â he said.
Charles S. Y. Liu, a private equity investor who sometimes advises the government, said the Chinese people were prepared to endure a protracted trade conflict.
âThe Chinese are more tolerant of pain because we have been poor for so long,â he said. âWealth has only arrived in the last decade.â
But many others are worried, and some have urged the Chinese leadership to seize the moment and shift the economy even further toward open markets and private enterprise rather than allowing an inefficient state sector to dig in.
âA closed approach will lead to a decline in the rate of national competitiveness,â wrote Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, in a recent paper. He warned that China risked returning to the stagnation it suffered in isolation during the Mao era.
âWhen Trump adopts a protectionist strategy, China should have an open door and force the state-owned enterprises to reform,â Professor Yan added in an interview. But he said his advice was being ignored. âI get no reaction. Nobody listens to me.â
Other Chinese are arguing that the spike in hostility from the United States could have been avoided if President Xi had continued the policy of âhiding strength, biding timeâ followed by his predecessors and originally set by Mr. Deng.
Mr. Xi instead has flaunted two ambitious programs: the global infrastructure plan known as the Belt and Road Initiative and the effort to dominate advanced industries known as Made in China 2025, both of which have drawn criticism by the Trump administration.
âThe same things can be done without such arrogance,â said Yun Sun, an analyst at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington. âI believe the Chinese policy community does wish to see more actions and more assertiveness but Xi went too far.â
The party has sought to censor criticism of Mr. Xi but there have been glimpses of anxiety online about the potential impact of the trade war as well as anger at the Belt and Road Initiative, which has earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars for overseas projects intended to lift Chinaâs clout abroad.
Echoing a popular opinion on social media, a retired economics professor, Sun Wenguang, has argued that it is wrong to spend so much money in other countries given the problems that China faces at home.
âSome are too poor to see a doctor, some are too poor to have pensions after retirement, and some too poor to go to school,â Professor Sun said in an interview on the Voice of America last month. âUnder such circumstances, if you still choose to throw money at other countries, domestic backlash is almost guaranteed.â
As he was speaking, the police entered his home and forced him off the phone.
Professor Sunâs criticism reflects a broader concern in China about the governmentâs efforts to win over allies. The subject is important because the United States has long touted its alliances as key to its national strength generally and its ability to counter Chinaâs rise in Asia in particular.
China enjoys significant advantages in the region. It is the largest trading partner of almost every country in Asia while President Trump has strained relations with allies around the world. Even Japan, Americaâs most important ally in Asia, appears to be drifting closer to China as Mr. Trump threatens the nation with tariffs.
In a rapprochement between the two Asian rivals, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to travel to Beijing next month, the first visit to China by a Japanese leader since 2011.
âTrump said recently, âJapan, youâre next for tariffs,ââ said Mr. Liu, the private equity manager. âThank you, Donald Trump.â
But some say China is fumbling the opportunity presented by the Trump administration and alienating neighbors by throwing its weight around too aggressively. There has been a backlash in several countries against Belt and Road projects that have left governments in deep debt, created few jobs for local residents or damaged the environment. Others have raised an alarm about Chinese efforts to interfere in politics of smaller nations.
In an essay that has been widely shared on Chinese social media, a prominent Communist Party scholar warned against national arrogance and overreach, noting the fate of rising powers that succumbed to ârecklessness and impetuousnessâ in the 20th century: Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union.
âI recall a topic hotly debated on line by young internet users: Who is really Chinaâs enemy? Is it America? Japan? Russia?â wrote the scholar, Luo Jianbo, head of the China Foreign Policy Center at the Central Party School. âIf we think about things coolly, perhaps none of them are. Chinaâs enemy is itself.â
In many ways, the Chinese political elite has been caught off guard by how quickly relations have deteriorated with the United States, which has long been a source of envy and inspiration for many Chinese as well as a leading destination for education and immigration.
Chinese scholars often observe that new American presidents usually take a hard line against China but seek cooperation after realizing how the two nations need each other. President Trump has stunned them by defying that pattern.
âI personally feel surprised by the fact that Trump is taking such radical measures,â said Mr. Hu, the newspaper editor. âI initially thought it was a joke, but it turns out to be a real policy, putting tariffs on all these products.â
Some Chinese analysts have sought to explain the escalating conflict with the United States by focusing on the personal qualities of the nationâs two leaders. Mr. Trump is a viewed as a fickle, transactional businessman who may retreat after the midterm elections in November. They note he has repeatedly spoken out against Chinaâs trade practices but said little about human rights or military issues.
Mr. Xi, on the other hand, is said to have invested too much politically in his signature programs to back down under foreign pressure.
âPersonality matters in this relationship,â said Wu Xinbo, the director of the American Studies Center at Fudan University. âThe biggest problem is Trumpâs credibility.â
Though Beijing devotes tremendous resources to studying the United States, there seems to be little understanding that the hostility against China in Washington is bipartisan and extends beyond trade, and that many frustrated business leaders, once defenders of good ties with China, now favor tougher measures against it as well.
Teng Jianqun, director of American studies at the China Institute for International Studies, said the government needed to accept the new reality and tell the Chinese public that the coming struggle could be the beginning of a long fight for the countryâs survival as a great power.
âWe should let our people fully know that this trade war is not a short-term contest,â he said, âbut a contest that will determine the future of the Chinese nation.â

"Trumpâs Tariffs May Hurt, but Quitting China Is Hard to Do","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2111837469?accountid=14586,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia â The worsening trade war between the United States and China has intensified pressure on companies to leave China and set up factories in places like Cambodia, a verdant country of 16 million people with low wages and high hopes.
But anybody who moves here may have to deal with the water buffalo.
Huffing, snorting and in no hurry to move, the big-horned bovines occasionally meander across the Khmer-American Friendship Highway, the dusty, 140-mile route linking Phnom Penhâs factories with the port in the coastal city of Sihanoukville. They are not the only potential obstacles. At quitting time, factory workers heading home on foot and motorbikes clog the road.
For factory owners on deadline, those crowded roads can mean frustrating delays.
âWhere Cambodia sits now is where China was 25 years ago,â said Piet Holten, who makes the microfiber cloths and bags for sport and fashion sunglass brands like Oakley. To get his sportswear products from his Phnom Penh factory to market, he flies them using DHL.
President Trumpâs tariffs on Chinese products, which expanded to an additional $200 billion worth of goods on Monday, are prompting many companies to rethink their supply chains. As tariffs begin to make China look more expensive, many companies are considering cheaper places to make their products, like Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Ethiopia. Already, companies with significant American business like Steve Madden, the fashion designer, and Puma, the German sports brand, have said they will look to shift production out of China.
But China will be hard to quit. From zippers and rivets on jackets and jeans to the minerals used in iPhones, China makes or processes many of the ingredients that go into todayâs consumer goods. It has a dependable source of workers who know how to hold down factory jobs. It has reliable roads and rail lines connecting suppliers to assembly plants to ports.
Countries like Vietnam and Cambodia, by contrast, lack Chinaâs vast supplier base and dependable roads. More workers have to be trained. Many companies have to start from scratch.
âWhen I came here in the beginning, it was a nightmare,â said Elli Bobrovizki, who runs a factory in Phnom Penh that makes Bloch ballet shoes.
Getting the pink ballet slippers and black jazz shoes out to places like the United States takes at least a day or two longer than it would in China, he said. To reach his factory, a visitor has to travel down a bumpy dirt road.
Inside, hundreds of workers cut leather from Brazil, then glue and carefully pinch, gather and hammer it into soles. The work could be partly automated, but the labor is cheap.
One day a few years ago Mr. Bobrovizki arrived at his factory to find several unions had locked it. Negotiations took weeks. In Cambodia some unions are backed by the party of Hun Sen, the prime minister, adding to political risks for foreign companies.
âI lost half a million dollars in those two weeks that they blocked my gate,â Mr. Bobrovizki said.
Companies are not looking to leave China just because of the trade war. Average wages have risen by about one-third in recent years, according to official data. The average Chinese factory worker makes roughly $10,000 a year, the official data shows. By contrast, the minimum wage for Cambodian garment workers amounts to about one-fifth of that. But rising tariffs, and the prospect of more on the horizon, add to the urgency.
âPeople are desperate to get out of China,â said Spencer Fung of Li & Fung, a go-between for Western companies and factories in developing countries.
One American company recently told a supplier with a factory in Phnom Penh that it wants to take its China production down to zero as soon as possible in order to avoid tariffs, said Bradley Gordon, a lawyer who advises multinational companies in Cambodia. That Phnom Penh factory plans to hire 1,000 more workers in the next month and employ nearly 10,000 workers by next year.
Still, China remains an efficient place to do business. Its logistics network is vast and quick-moving. Over the past three decades, China has built 4.7 million kilometers, or about 2.9 million miles, of highways. It has 13 of the worldâs 50 largest ports, and three of the top five.
Chinaâs sheer manufacturing capabilities are unrivaled. One measure of its output, called manufacturing value added, shows that China makes roughly as much as the United States and Japan combined.
âThe entire supply chain is based in China, so if we were to move, we would still have to procure components in China, and then export them somewhere else,â said Aaron Emigh, co-founder of Brilliant, an American start-up that makes smart-home devices. Brilliant is releasing its product just as the Trump administrationâs tariffs take effect.
âMoving out of China is not purely a matter of cost, but of possibility,â he added.
Brilliantâs devices have more than 700 components, most of which are sourced in China. The country offers the best manufacturing options for some of Brilliantâs most technical needs, like printing circuit boards, injection-molded plastics, screens and modules.
Some companies believe they have to look for alternatives no matter how appealing China can be.
Inventec, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer of laptops and devices for companies like HP, Toshiba and Acer, has drawn up contingency plans to move China production to Taiwan, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Houston, according to Ada Chang, a spokeswoman.
Moving the entire supply chain out of China would be too complicated, she said. But Inventec could assemble the final product in other places so the âcountry of originâ certificate would not say China, she said.
Peter Baum knows well the challenges of operating in a country like Cambodia. An owner of Baum-Essex, a company that makes umbrellas for Costco and cotton bags for Walmart in contracted factories in Vietnam and Cambodia, he gets frustrated when he has to turn to multiple countries for the parts and material he needs because it means more opportunity for delays.
âIt is the worst nightmare known to man,â Mr. Baum said. He recently finished an order for umbrellas for Costco. The wood handles from Italy were delayed. The polyester from Taiwan was the wrong pattern.
âI probably lost a couple of hundred thousand on the transaction,â he said.
Cambodiaâs lack of development in many areas adds its own complications.
Mr. Holten, the manufacturer whose company makes products for Oakley, decided to open a factory in Cambodia in 2010. His competitors thought he was crazy, he said, because China was still cheap. âI saw the writing on the wall,â said Mr. Holten, whose company, Pactics, still makes cloth bags for Burberry in China.
Still, it was not easy, he said. There was no infrastructure, no power and no space appropriate to rent. Pactics had to build its own factory with a water purification system, solar panels and a separate power generator. The project took a year and cost $960,000.
It was worth it, Mr. Holten said. âIf we were still in China,â he said, âweâd be out of business.â
Transition in Cambodia has been slow. Paradoxically, one source of change may be China itself, as it looks to win political favor in Southeast Asia. During an official visit this year, Li Keqiang, Chinaâs premier, pledged to build a new expressway from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville to supplement the Khmer-American Friendship Highway.
More foreign companies have called or emailed Ken Loo, secretary general at the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia, in recent months about doing business there. His advice: Be realistic.
âItâs not like going into the shop to buy something and you just go to the next shop,â Mr. Loo said. Starting a factory from scratch, he said, âtakes months, if not a year and a half.â

Trump to China: âI Own You.â Guess Again.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2112291650?accountid=14586,"Early in the movie âCrazy Rich Asiansâ a Chinese-Singaporean father admonishes his young kids to finish their dinner, saying, âThink of all the starving children in America.â Iâm sure that everyone of my generation in the theater laughed at that joke. After all, weâd all been raised on the line: âFinish your dinner. Think of all the starving children in China.â
That little line contained within it many messages: The first, which any regular traveler to Chinaâs biggest urban areas can tell you, is that rich China today â its luxury homes, cars, restaurants and hotels â is really rich, rich like most Americans canât imagine.
The second is that this moment was destined to be a test of who will set the key rules of the global order in the 21st century: the worldâs long-dominant economic and military superpower, America, or its rising rival, China. And this test is playing out with a blossoming full-scale trade war.
What does such a test of wills sound like? It sounds like a senior Chinese official telling me at a seminar at Tsinghua University in April that itâs just âtoo lateâ for America to tell China what to do anymore on issues like trade, because China is now too big and powerful. And it sounds like President Trump, in effect, telling China: âSays who? Show me what you got, baby!â Or as Trump actually tweeted last week: âWe are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. â¦ If we meet, we meet.â
I guess we should be grateful that this confrontation has been confined to trade, but, as I said, it was inevitable. Because, as one top tech executive pointed out to me: âChina is not a ânear peerâ anymore. It is a peer.â
As Mary Meekerâs latest internet trends study noted, five years ago China had only two of the worldâs largest publicly traded tech companies, while the U.S. had nine. Today, China has nine of the top 20 â Alibaba, Tencent, Ant Financial, Baidu, Xiaomi, Didi, JD.com, Meituan and Toutiao â and the U.S. has 11. Twenty years ago, China had none.
Do you see a trend? Do you hear footsteps? The total value of Chinaâs internet economy is already bigger than Americaâs. And Chinaâs economy now is so cashless that many women no longer carry purses or men wallets â just a cellphone with mobile apps â to buy anything, or even donate to a beggar.
And donât get me started on the biggest emerging work and services tool in the world â artificial intelligence. Chinaâs plan is to catch up to America in A.I. and surpass it as soon as possible, and itâs well on its way. Because with A.I., the more training data you can feed the machine the faster it learns, the more patterns you can see and the more algorithms you can write to improve products and services or invent new ones. Because China has so many more people than we do, and so many more of them use mobile apps for their daily lives, Chinaâs ability to amass giant data sets and train more machines faster is considerable.
âIf data is the new oil, then China is the new Saudi Arabia,â remarked Kai-Fu Lee, author of âAI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.â
Chinese companies are already the world leaders in computer vision/facial recognition and speech recognition, which can be used for commerce and for surveillance and societal control. In just the last two years there has been an explosion of fintech start-ups in China, offering mobile payments, lending, brokerage and banking. And the No. 1 and 3 drone manufacturers in the world â DJI and Xiaomi â are Chinese. Franceâs Parrot is No. 2. At the same time, China is producing far more engineers and scientists than the U.S., and their quality is steadily rising.
America today, by contrast, has become the unrivaled world leader in generating data about Donald Trump and from Donald Trump.
In the daily barrage of Trump news and tweets, some Trump statements are actually true, though â like the need for the U.S. to confront Chinaâs unfair trade practices. China has grown incredibly these past 30 years with a very specific formula: hard work, unleashing capitalism, smart planning and long-range investments in education and infrastructure â but also by stealing intellectual property, forcing technology transfers and cheating on World Trade Organization rules.
We have to respond. But wisely.
Historically the U.S. could dominate the global scene and check a rising power like China, and set the global rules, with just our sheer physical mass â more money, more troops, more naval ships, more top-10 companies, more scientists and more universities. That is just not possible any longer, as China has become both big and smart in more and more areas. But all is not lost.
It happens that we have three huge assets that China doesnât have, and is unlikely to acquire them anytime soon. We should be doubling down on our strengths: immigration, allies and values. Instead, Trump is squandering them.
Many of the smartest and most talented people in the world â high-I.Q. risk-takers â still want to come to our country. And in a knowledge-talent era, where companies thrive by being the first and fastest to put intelligence into everything they make, we should be welcoming more high-skilled immigrants than ever and giving green cards to every Chinese, and other foreign students, who come to America for advanced degrees. China canât attract the best and brightest Indian, Israeli, Arab, French, Brazilian and Korean immigrants, but we still can. So why would we put out a sign saying âGo Awayâ or make it harder for their students to stay here?
Also, we have real allies in a way China does not. China has clients, customers and frightened neighbors. It does not have real partners like Canada and Mexico. It doesnât have the whole Atlantic alliance with the European Union or tight relations with Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Australia â which we can leverage if we arenât doing stupid stuff, like slapping them with steel tariffs or tearing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Finally, as a society, we stand for things â or at least we used to stand for things â values people admire, about the dignity of human beings, the rights of minorities and women and the virtues of freedom and the rules for fair play.
Our nation has never been just a beacon for profit-making, which only measured countries by their trade balance with us. Our values attracted people to our shores and helped us spread our rules onto the wider world. When Trump tore up the TPP trade deal Iâm certain that he actually disappointed Chinaâs economic reformers, who wanted to use the pact to create pressures inside China to reform.
In short, a strategic president wouldnât squander our strengths but would reinforce them by creating a stronger global network of people and countries that share our values. We won the Cold War with a strategy of containment and bankrupting the Soviet Union by outspending the Kremlin on defense. But we will âwinâ this standoff with China, not by brute force alone, or by containment of Chinaâs giant economy, but by âentanglementâ â entanglement of Chinese students with our schools, Chinese businesses with our values, and the Chinese government with our allies. That is, with the broad alliances and global institutions, and their rules of fair play, that weâve been part of since World War II.
So we have to fight for those rules, and China will fight for its versions. But ultimately, I believe, the U.S. and China together will have to play the role that the U.S. played alone after World War II â to define the rules of the new international order, from A.I. to privacy to trade. And our weight in that process â we must never forget â will depend on the talent we attract, the allies we rally and the values we embrace and promote.

"As China Rattles Its Sword, Taiwanese Push a Separate Identity","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2126155194?accountid=14586,"TAIPEI, Taiwan â With greater frequency, China is using its growing air and sea power to try to intimidate Taiwan, the self-ruled island that it hopes to annex. China has also weaponized its economic prowess to induce foreign companies and even governments to erase Taiwanâs international presence.
But in Taiwan itself, there has been increasing blowback.
A vocal segment of Taiwanâs population of 23 million is trying to push back against Beijing with a potent weapon that Chinaâs arsenal of influence lacks: democracy and the power of popular referendums.
Chinaâs pressure campaign appears to have hardened Taiwanese resolve against the Chinese Communist Party, while fueling resentment toward the awkward Cold War labels Taiwan operates under in the international sphere. As a result, many Taiwanese are hoping to take control of their identity, and their fate, through the ballot box, despite the threat of attack from China that hangs over such moves.
A referendum next month asks whether Taiwan should compete at international sporting events under that name, rather than âChinese Taipei.â Activists are also seeking to change the law to allow for a referendum on national sovereignty.
Supporters of both were at a pro-independence march and rally in downtown Taipei last Saturday that drew thousands of people. Protesters denounced both Chinaâs goal of annexing Taiwan as well as the continued use of the islandâs official name, the Republic of China.
For many older Taiwanese, the Republic of China name and flag conjure memories of Chiang Kai-shekâs Kuomintang government, which arrived in 1945, massacred tens of thousands of Taiwanese in 1947, and declared martial law in 1949 that lasted until 1987.
The name was kept to suggest that the Kuomintang was Chinaâs true government, despite the Communist victory in the countryâs civil war. But today it can create the impression that Taiwan is officially part of China.
Threading their way through Taipeiâs old city center en route to the rally on Saturday, hundreds of marchers chanted âReferendum for a new country! New clothes for Taiwan!â The chants were in Taiwanese, the most widely spoken language in Taiwan, which is mutually unintelligible from Mandarin. Signs and banners opposing China and Taiwanâs Republic of China identity were ubiquitous.
One demonstrator, Liao Yao-song, said he and the rallyâs attendees wanted to establish an independent country under the name Taiwan.
âIt must be done through referendum,â he said. âWe need to reform the referendum law, then we can change the name of the country and change the national flag.â
Last December, Taiwanâs referendum law was overhauled by the legislature, which made it easier to propose and pass referendums but kept constitutional issues like the islandâs name, flag and territory off limits. (The Republic of China Constitution claims not only Taiwan, but also sovereignty over all of China and Mongolia.)
The rallyâs organizer, the Formosa Alliance, seeks to change the referendum law in order to have a referendum on national sovereignty, which it has said it wants to hold next April. The groupâs members include two former presidents, Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian.
Several speakers praised Taiwanâs democracy while citing a litany of Chinese threats to freedom: forced detentions of rights lawyers and activists, a vast network of detention camps in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang and the erosion of democracy in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous part of China.
The rally was also held to protest Chinaâs efforts to whittle down the list of countries that officially recognize the Taiwanese government and pressure companies not to refer to Taiwan as a separate country.
Most of the rallyâs participants were old enough to remember martial law, but others were younger and drawn into politics by the Sunflower protests of 2014, which derailed a proposed trade agreement with China negotiated by the most recent Kuomintang administration.
Listening to speeches near a collection of stalls set up by local churches, gay rights groups and pro-independence T-shirt vendors, Chen Hung-chia, 32, said the Taiwanese people needed to save themselves from Chinaâs threat.
âIf I donât stand up, nobody will stand up for me,â Mr. Chen said. âI donât want to be annexed by China.â
The Chinese Communist Party, which claims Taiwan but has never ruled it, sees things differently. On Thursday, the Chinese defense minister, Wei Fenghe, warned Taiwan against making any moves toward formalizing its independence.
âThe Taiwan issue is related to Chinaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity and touches upon Chinaâs core interests,â Mr. Wei said at a forum in Beijing. âIf someone tries to separate out Taiwan, Chinaâs army will take the necessary actions at any cost.â
In her recent National Day speech, Ms. Tsai used the term âTaiwanâ 48 times, compared with four mentions of âRepublic of Chinaâ and two references to the âRepublic of China in Taiwanâ.
Many Taiwanese do in fact oppose formal moves that might bring a military response from China. So some independence-minded groups have their eyes on lower-hanging fruit.
In late November, Taiwan will hold local elections, which will include a referendum question on whether Taiwan should compete in the 2020 Olympics and other international sporting events as âTaiwanâ rather than âChinese Taipei,â a name that the Kuomintang chose for such events in 1981 to maintain its claim on China, which it effectively gave up a decade later.
Earlier this month, Taiwanâs Central Election Commission said that it had verified more than 429,000 signatures on the petition for that referendum, far more than the minimum 281,745 required. The number of signatures is roughly 2 percent of Taiwanâs population.
Should voters choose âTaiwan,â the result will almost certainly be ignored by the International Olympic Committee, which has selected Beijing to host the 2022 Winter Games.
Taiwanese animosity over having to compete under the âChinese Taipeiâ label was stirred last year when the organizers of the World University Games, or Universiade, changed Taiwanâs name in a media guidebook to âChinese Taipei.â Public uproar in Taiwan forced the International University Sports Federation to rescind the change.
Proponents of the November referendum say that even if the International Olympic Committee does not allow Taiwan to compete under that name at the 2020 Games in Tokyo, the world will at least know where the Taiwanese people stand on the issue.
âIt doesnât say âChinese Taipeiâ on maps â it says âTaiwan,ââ Jongher Yang, former director of the Taipei municipal sports bureau and a member of the group behind the Olympic referendum, said in a phone interview. âWe just want to let others know what place our athletes come from.â

China Seeks Allies as Trumpâs Trade War Mounts. It Wonât Be Easy.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2130105876?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI â Faced with mounting American tariffs that could slow Chinaâs already weakened economy, President Xi Jinping is pressing the case to the rest of the world that China can be a positive force for global trade.
The challenge will be convincing the world he means it.
Mr. Xi, the countryâs top leader, on Monday kicked off a six-day expo intended to show China as a big buyer of foreign goods. He extolled Chinaâs appetite for what the rest of the world makes, and he reiterated promises that Beijing would lower import tariffs and improve intellectual property protection to help make that happen.
âOpenness has become a trademark of China,â Mr. Xi said. âChina has grown by embracing the world, and the world has also benefited by Chinaâs opening up.â
âToday, as economic globalization deepens and develops,â he added, âthe ideas of the law of the jungle and winner take all increasingly lead to a dead end.â
Mr. Xiâs import expo is expected to bring 150,000 Chinese buyers to Shanghai this week to a vast exhibition center with more than five times the exhibition space of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York to peruse imports offered by businesses from 130 countries. It was intended to show that China offers more to the world than its vast manufacturing sector, which has flooded the world with goods and prompted leaders in the United States and elsewhere to worry about their own domestic industries.
Chinaâs challenge was on display, as well, particularly when you consider who skipped the event. Despite months of energetic efforts by China to persuade foreign leaders to attend, only about a dozen presidents and prime ministers â from Hungary, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, among others â showed up Monday morning. Many were leaders of countries, like Kenya and Laos, that have borrowed heavily from Beijing as part of Mr. Xiâs Belt and Road Initiative, which is lending money for infrastructure projects across Asia, Eastern Europe and East Africa.
Notably absent were the leaders of major trading nations like Germany, Britain, South Korea and Japan. The United States did not send an official delegation at all.
Even some who attended struck a discordant note. Speaking on Monday morning in Shanghai, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya said that his countryâs trade with China has grown eightfold in the past decade. âThis trade, however, was heavily skewed in favor of China,â he said.
Even while seeking a trade deal with Washington, Beijing has increasingly tried to appeal to the rest of the world, both for political support in the clash with the United States and to make sure China has more places to sell its products. Illustrating that effort, Mr. Xi met recently with Shinzo Abe, Japanâs prime minister, in a move widely seen as a signal that President Trumpâs tough trade stance against Japan and China could bring the two regional rivals closer together.
Governments in Europe and East Asia have found themselves increasingly caught in the middle of the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular among the public in many countries, particularly in Western Europe, making it politically difficult for leaders there to support him in the trade dispute.
But many European and East Asian leaders have complaints similar to Mr. Trumpâs. They say China discriminates against foreign companies doing business here and unfairly supports local companies. Some have begun to favor taking a similarly aggressive stance against China.
Adam Dunnett, the secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said that in the past few months some European companies had begun to favor a tougher, American-style position. They want restrictions on Chinese exports to Europe unless Beijing provides the same access to its markets for European companies that Europe has long provided for Chinese companies.
âThis is a fundamental change,â he said. âThe fact that weâve got members talking that way is a real concern.â
Mr. Dunnett declined to identify the companies, and added that the chamber of commerce had not shifted its own position. The chamber has long called for greater openness of Chinaâs markets without endorsing threats of tariffs or other measures on Chinese exports to Europe.
Some European business leaders have begun echoing American complaints that China was allowed into the World Trade Organization in 2001 without enough rules to force it to become more of a market-based economy.
âWe decided to open the door to China probably in a little bit naÃ¯ve way,â said Patrick PouyannÃ©, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French energy giant.
The shift in business attitudes has coincided with a shift in Trump administration policies in recent months toward rallying other countries to oppose Chinese trade policies, and away from unilateralism.
The United States imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports this year on a long list of countries that included many allies, pushed to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement and threatened tariffs on imports of European cars.
But Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has spent the past few months focusing on China while mending fences with European and East Asian nations and seeking bilateral free trade deals with a growing number of them.
The effort has potential appeal for American allies. The trade ministers of the European Union, Japan and the United States issued a joint statement in late September that denounced forced technology transfers, industrial subsidies and government-backed efforts to turn state-owned enterprises into national champions. The statement clearly referred to China, although it was not mentioned by name.
China is looking to resolve the trade war before it further damages the countryâs slowing economy. Growth has been hurt by debt worries and declining business and consumer confidence.
Mr. Xi on Monday emphasized that China had opened up more sectors this year to foreign investment. Big companies like BASF, the German chemical giant, and Exxon Mobil, the oil and gas company, have made use of the opportunity to rush in and sign deals in recent months. In a nod to one major concern among foreign companies, he also said China would strengthen intellectual property protections so that firms would worry less about theft and copycats.
China will âput in place a punitive, comprehensive system to significantly raise the cost for offenders,â Mr. Xi said Monday, without providing a timetable or details.
Chinaâs imports have indeed been climbing in recent months. Its trade surplus with the rest of the world has shrunk when compared with the size of the countryâs economy, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noted in a brief speech on Monday. But much of that comes from importing commodities, not importing the kinds of manufactured goods that can lead to factory jobs abroad.
That is not to say the world is on the side of the United States. American trading partners continue to warn that Mr. Trumpâs unilateral moves to impose tariffs and rip up trade agreements could upset the global economic order. That bothers American trading partners, in particular moves by the United States that fall outside the World Trade Organization, the global accord that sets many of the rules of global commerce.
âWhat we are worried about is this unilateral approach,â Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice president for the euro and social dialogue, said in a recent interview. âWe think trade should be dealt with in a multilateral framework.â

Military Competition in Pacific Endures as Biggest Flash Point Between U.S. and China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2133530791?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â Trade disputes have for months been the focus of souring relations between the United States and China. But intractable problems in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait underscore that competition for dominance of the Pacific Ocean remains the most volatile source of conflict between the two nations â and the tensions are rising.
That became clear in barbed comments during a meeting in Washington last week in which Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, negotiated with their Chinese counterparts. And it is evident as Vice President Mike Pence is in Asia this week to talk to East Asian and Southeast Asian leaders to shore up support for American efforts to counterbalance China.
Mr. Penceâs trip includes stops at two Asia-Pacific summit meetings, where he plans to speak about checking Chinaâs influence and power projection. Since his broad speech last month on American competition with China, Mr. Pence has become the face of the administrationâs aggressive approach to Beijing.
Some Asia analysts say, though, that President Trumpâs absence sends a signal that the United States is not committed to the region: President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia are each attending at least one of the gatherings.
Strategy for the region, in Washington and Beijing, revolves around how each country can assert military dominance in the Pacific. For now, the most powerful military in the region is still that of the United States, which relies on the ability to have unfettered naval access to the South China Sea and the support of the self-governing island of Taiwan to bolster its standing.
But China has become more aggressive in trying to assert dominance over both. And its state-owned companies are making inroads in the islands of Oceania â from Saipan to Vanuatu â with infrastructure projects. American officials say those could eventually become beachheads for the Peopleâs Liberation Army, which would pose a challenge to the United States Navyâs operational command in the far island chains. Australia is also watching closely because the South Pacific has traditionally been its sphere of influence.
Closer to home, China has continued to place military equipment and installations on rocks and reefs in the South China Sea, over which it claims sovereignty. And it is persuading some nations to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan while forcing foreign companies, including hotels and airlines, to drop any mention of Taiwan.
There is a consensus in Washington that American officials need to find ways of pushing back.
In the South China Sea, that has mainly taken the form of what are called freedom-of-navigation operations by the Navy, in which ships sail near the islands or features claimed by Beijing to establish that the waters are international â and not Chinese territory. On Sept. 30, American and Chinese warships nearly collided, coming within 45 yards of each other.
On Tuesday, Mr. Penceâs plane flew over the South China Sea to Singapore, where he attended the annual summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Mr. Pence told a Washington Post columnist on the plane that the flight, which passed within 50 miles of the contested Spratly Islands, was a type of freedom-of-navigation operation.
âWe will not be intimidated,â he said. âWe will not stand down. We will continue to exercise freedom of navigation.â
Graham Allison, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who wrote a book on the potential for war between the United States and China, said most people in the region had thought it was âgame overâ on the South China Sea â too late to roll back Chinaâs presence from rocks and reefs, as well as islands it created by dredging sand.
But âthe Trump administration now means to fight back vigorously on all fronts, including on the South China Sea â and perhaps even on Taiwan,â Mr. Allison said.
Last Friday, at the close of the Washington meeting with their Chinese counterparts, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mattis made sharp comments on Pacific issues.
âRegarding our strong ties with a democratic Taiwan, I reiterated the U.S. policy has not changed and that we are concerned about Chinaâs increasing efforts to coerce others, constraining Taiwanâs international space,â Mr. Pompeo said, notably, in opening remarks to journalists.
Later, Gen. Wei Fenghe, the Chinese defense minister, made his own assertive comments on Taiwan, referencing the American Civil War and the United States Pledge of Allegiance.
âTo achieve reunification is a mission for our party and our country,â General Wei said. âIn the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S., there is this sentence saying this is a nation under God, indivisible. So it is the same with Taiwan. It is an inalienable part of China.â
If âthis territorial integrity is under threat,â he said, China would move to maintain it âat any cost,â just as the United States had to do âin the Civil War.â
Analysts in Washington took note of the remarks.
âI believe itâs rare that the U.S. side raises Taiwan in a news conference with the Chinese in an opening statement,â said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. âPompeo referred to âdemocratic Taiwan.â That will surely rankle the Chinese. I expect Chinaâs remarks in private regarding Taiwan were even sharper.â
The United States has been more aggressive in defending Taiwanese interests since John R. Bolton became national security adviser in April.
Last month, the Pentagon sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait, which underscored the potential for conflict.
The White House had initially considered sending an aircraft carrier through the strait â something the United States has not done since 2007. That most likely would have ignited a furious response from China. Instead, the Pentagon sent a cruiser and a destroyer.
Defense Department officials had argued that the carrier would be too provocative at a time when Washington and Beijing are already at loggerheads over trade and other issues. That includes Communist Party repression of ethnic Uighur Muslims, which Mr. Pompeo regularly denounces. On Wednesday, American legislators introduced bills calling on the Trump administration to take action to defend the Uighurs.
Mr. Mattis and Mr. Wei have tried to lower the temperature on tensions in the Pacific. Before the Washington talks, the two met in Singapore last month on the sidelines of a conclave of Southeast Asian defense ministers.
But one Defense Department official said that cordial talks were the limits of what the two nations could achieve for now. Both countries have dug into seemingly nonnegotiable positions on Chinaâs militarization of disputed land features in the South China Sea â the issue that most bedevils the military relationship.
The Chinese do not describe their actions as militarization; they accuse the United States of militarizing the sea with its freedom-of-navigation ship operations and overflights. Now, officials from Britain and France say their navies are also taking part in the operations, even though Southeast Asian nations contesting Chinaâs claims have not publicly committed to participating.
Yang Jiechi, the senior Chinese foreign policy official who attended the Washington meeting, said China was building what he described as civilian facilities and necessary defense facilities âon its own territory.â
âThe Chinese side made it clear to the United States that it should stop sending its vessels and military aircraft close to Chinese islands and reefs, and stop actions that undermine Chinaâs sovereignty and security interest,â Mr. Yang said.
Michael Pillsbury, an author on the Chinese military cited by Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, said the Chinese would no doubt continue to see the actions in a hostile light. They are, he said, âinterpreting these freedom-of-navigation exercises, even when theyâre innocent passage, as something more â provocations, or a declining hegemon trying to maintain its power.â

"In Race for Global Power, U.S. and China Push Nations to Pick a Side","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2136618069?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â The escalating brinkmanship between the United States and China as they race to quash each otherâs global influence is forcing other nations to pick sides between the two superpowers, putting at risk future cooperation on geopolitical threats and a resolution to the economic standoff.
The rivalry, which has reached a new pitch and scope, is now centered on the trade war that President Trump started this year. But tensions have also sharpened over a broad range of diplomatic and military issues, like Taiwan, the South China Sea and economic sanctions on North Korea and Iran.
Across the globe, the United States and China are jockeying to build alliances or partnerships and shut out the other power. The hard-nosed competition surfaced over the weekend at an Asian economic forum that pitted Vice President Mike Pence against President Xi Jinping of China. The dispute threatens to disrupt the Group of 20 summit meeting that starts Nov. 30 in Argentina.
The United States again vented its frustration on Tuesday, accusing China of continuing to engage in unfair trade practices despite Mr. Trumpâs tariffs. âChina fundamentally has not altered its acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation, and indeed appears to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months,â the Office of the United States Trade Representative said in a report.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly said China âwants to make a deal very badly,â but continues to warn that he will tax nearly all Chinese imports if Beijing does not open its markets to American companies and end its unfair practices.
âChina has been ripping off our country for many, many years,â the president told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. âAnd they donât rip us off with me.â
In Beijing on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, responded to such criticisms by pointing to a paper previously issued by the government that rebutted similar accusations. âIt is quite normal to have economic and trade frictions,â he said at a news conference. âThe key is to resolve them through dialogue and consultation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and good faith.â
At the economic forum in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the United States and China openly clashed over trade in their most explosive diplomatic standoff of the Trump administration. Mr. Pence and Mr. Xi each led delegations that sought to corral the other nations in attendance to side with his country.
Elsewhere, the two nations are forging bilateral and multilateral trade pacts in parallel that limit options for the other. During his visit to the Philippines this week, Mr. Xi signed 29 trade and investment deals, though many were broad and vague.
Some countries are bristling at the economic demands that the two superpowers have made.
Canadaâs agriculture minister said Monday that his country could freely enter into formal trade negotiations with China, despite an apparent attempt by the United States to exercise leverage over any such action.
On Tuesday, in a blow to China, the European Union announced a proposed law to coordinate scrutiny of foreign investment in strategic sectors, such as ports and technology.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi are both expected to attend the Group of 20 meeting. While they could come to some mutual understanding, âit is becoming increasingly difficult for both sides to reconcile their competing perspectives,â said Ryan Hass, a China analyst at the Brookings Institution.
âBoth countries are becoming entrenched in their narratives and having increasing difficulty finding common ground,â Mr. Hass said. But virtually no country in Asia wants to be exclusively aligned with either power, he added.
On the issue of recognition of Taiwan, China and the United States are pushing nations and private companies. Since 2016, China has campaigned, often with promises of loans and investments, to persuade a small number of nations to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Three Central American countries did so over the last two years, infuriating top American officials, even though the United States cut formal ties with Taiwan in favor of Communist-ruled China in 1979.
American officials are trying to deter nations from taking Chinese loans, often for infrastructure projects, by talking about Beijingâs âdebt-trap diplomacy.â In their global propaganda push, they promise that American private investment will flow throughout the world, in part because of a new program to aid businesses with up to $60 billion in loans and loan insurance.
Officials in Washington are also trying to rally Southeast Asian nations to stand firm against Beijing over its expansive territorial claims and military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Mr. Pence criticized Chinaâs moves as âempire and aggressionâ in a speech at an annual regional forum last week in Singapore.
China, for its part, has signaled to other nations that they should push back against Mr. Trump on one of his signature foreign policy actions â withdrawing the United States from the nuclear agreement with Iran.
The Obama administration forged the deal to limit Iranâs nuclear program in 2015 with other world powers, including China; backing out of it was one of Mr. Trumpâs campaign promises. A top Chinese foreign policy official said in Washington this month that the agreement should âbe implemented and observed.â China is continuing to buy oil from Iran, as are some other nations.
Chinaâs moves to strengthen its global standing have received a big boost from Mr. Trumpâs denunciations of multilateral institutions, alliances and treaties.
Mr. Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which shook the confidence of Asian nations. After Mr. Trump announced in June 2017 that the United States would leave the Paris climate accord, China has presented itself as the new standard-bearer on addressing climate change. Earlier that year, in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Xi said China would defend the globalized economy in the face of criticism by Mr. Trump.
Some Trump administration officials are optimistic that the two leaders will emerge from the Group of 20 meeting with the framework of a trade agreement that would reduce Americaâs bilateral trade deficit with China and protect the intellectual property of American companies who do business there. Treasury Department officials have been in frequent contact with their Chinese counterparts in hopes of building the groundwork for a deal.
However, the latest lurch toward a dÃ©tente has renewed division among Mr. Trumpâs economic team.
This month, Peter Navarro, Mr. Trumpâs top trade adviser, warned that a weak agreement would have the âstenchâ of Wall Street. In a public rebuke days later, Larry Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, called Mr. Navarro âway off base.â Mr. Navarroâs comments also frustrated Mr. Trump who, according to a person familiar with his thinking, felt boxed in by the remarks.
The dissonance has left China uncertain of the Trump administrationâs goals and cast a shadow of uncertainty over their negotiations.
âIt feels to me like the administration doesnât quite have one strategy toward China,â said Jon B. Alterman, a global security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. âNot only do you see administration leaders saying different things, but it feels like theyâre not integrated, especially in the absence of something like the TPP, which was a genuine long-term strategy to deal with Chinaâs rise.â
On Monday, the Commerce Department began drawing up new regulations on export controls, outlining potential industries to protect â such as artificial intelligence and quantum robotics â from Chinese theft of intellectual property. In early November, the Justice Department charged a Chinese state-owned company with stealing trade secrets from an American technology company. And last month, the Trump administration outlined a more aggressive system for policing foreign investment, using the expanded powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
The Trump administration has also embarked on bilateral trade deals with other countries with the intention of exerting pressure on China. Despite abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the administration is forging ahead with negotiations with Japan and the Philippines, and officials are eyeing possible talks with Vietnam and India.
Criticism of Chinaâs trade practices was at the center of the blowup at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum over the weekend.
In several meetings, Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, and his colleagues objected to a draft of the forumâs closing statement that asserted, âWe agree to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices.â
Raising his voice, Mr. Wang accused American officials of trying to insert a veiled reference to China, said one American official who was there. At one point, Chinese officials barged into the office of the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea to demand changes.
Only China objected to the draft. The forum closed without a consensus statement from the 21 member economies for the first time since 1989.
âIt was truly a stupid move by the Chinese,â said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. âI guess we should all conclude that China will do whatever it takes to continue to pursue unfair trade practices.â
âAnd they will also continue to put their narrow self-interests first at the expense of multilateral institutions,â she added. âWhatâs next?â

Chinaâs Tactic to Catch a Fugitive Official: Hold His Two American Children,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2139181327?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â When Victor and Cynthia Liu landed with their mother on a tropical Chinese island in June to visit an ailing grandfather, they thought they would soon be on a plane back to their East Coast lives â he to start his sophomore year at Georgetown University, and she to work at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York.
Instead, within days, police officers detained their mother, Sandra Han, who, like her children, is an American citizen. They moved her to a secret site, commonly known as a black jail. The children discovered at the airport that they could not leave China, even though the police had said they were not being investigated or charged with a crime, the children told American officials and family associates.
By holding the family hostage, they said, the police are trying to force the siblingsâ father to return to China to face criminal charges. The father, Liu Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank, is accused of being a central player in a $1.4 billion fraud case.
The children say their father severed ties with the family in 2012, but the Chinese authorities have still held them for months under a practice known as an exit ban â a growing tactic that has become the latest flash point in the increasingly rancorous relationship between the United States and China.
Senior American diplomats, already contending with tensions over trade and territorial disputes, have denounced the way China uses exit bans as coercive, opaque and a violation of rights. In January, the State Department issued a travel warning, saying the practice posed risks to foreigners in China. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the bans during a visit to China, and this month he mentioned the Liu family to a top Chinese foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, at a meeting in Washington.
The siblings have pleaded their case to American officials, including John R. Bolton, the national security adviser. âThe investigative officers have made abundantly clear that neither my brother nor I am under any form of investigation,â Ms. Liu, 27, wrote to Mr. Bolton in an August letter obtained by The New York Times. âWe are being held here as a crude form of human collateral to induce someone with whom I have no contact to return to China for reasons with which I am entirely unfamiliar.â
She made similar points in an email sent in recent days to a family associate, saying that âthe Chinese authorities have been consistent that neither Victor nor I are accused of or suspected of any criminal activity,â and that the authorities have repeatedly said that âthe reason we are here is exclusively to lureâ their father.
On Friday, in response to questions from The Times, a State Department spokesman, Robert Palladino, said the United States would continue expressing concern about exit bans âuntil we see a transparent and fair process.â
The Chinese Foreign Ministry defended the holding of the three family members, saying: âThe people you mentioned all own legal and valid identity documents as Chinese citizens. Because they are suspected of economic crimes, they are restricted from exiting the country by the Chinese police in accordance with the law.â
This account of the Liu familyâs plight is based on interviews with administration and congressional officials, university employees and family associates, as well as correspondence by the children to them and public records. There are currently a handful of exit-ban cases involving Americans, but this is the first one in which those with knowledge of it are making the details public.
It is also a rare instance in which one of those being held â Mr. Liu, 19 â was born in the United States. More often, China imposes exit bans, which can last from days to years, on naturalized foreign citizens who were born in China. Security officers often treat them as if they were still Chinese citizens, even though China does not recognize dual nationality.
The law in China states that its nationals automatically lose their citizenship when they gain citizenship in another country. It also says that someone like Mr. Liu who is born with citizenship from another nation is not a Chinese citizen, no matter the parentsâ citizenship.
The Liu family members all entered China on American passports, and the State Department is providing them with citizen services. The police from Guangzhou, the southern provincial capital where the father worked, have taken Ms. Han, 51, to a hotel several times to meet with an American consular officer.
Liu Changming, 53, the father, is among Chinaâs most-wanted fugitives, accused of helping to carry out one of the countryâs biggest bank frauds, in which $1.4 billion in illegal loans was issued to property developers. He fled the country in 2007.
In recent years, as the Chinese authorities have waged a fierce crackdown on corruption, they have increasingly viewed family members of corrupt officials as being tied to the illegal acts, with the police sometimes aiming to prosecute spouses.
The Liu family has lived with notable wealth in the United States, in part by acquiring real estate, though there is no indication from public records that the properties were purchased with the money that the father is accused of embezzling.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Edward J. Markey and Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrats from Massachusetts, where the mother lives, have urged the United States government to act.
âOur office is aware of Victorâs, Cynthiaâs and Sandraâs situations and is deeply concerned,â Mr. Markeyâs office said in a statement. âWe are working to secure their safe return and continue to be in touch with U.S. officials to ensure a positive outcome.â
Purgatory With the Police
The Liu children are trapped in a situation far from their elite American lives. Both attended Groton, an expensive Massachusetts boarding school. Ms. Liu graduated from Stanford and Harvard Business School. The family has a $2.3 million house in a Boston suburb, and the mother, a businesswoman, controls or has her name on companies with real estate holdings worth at least $10 million, including two luxury apartments in Manhattan, according to public records.
Since June, the children have tried to leave China three times. They travel between cities, staying in hotels or with an uncle. Their ailing grandfather died in October. They limit their electronic communications because of suspected surveillance.
âOut of concern for the security of these young Americans, we will refrain from public comment as we continue our efforts to constructively and directly engage the Chinese government to allow them to return home,â said David Pressman, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who is representing the Liu children.
The Georgetown president met with the children this month in Beijing. Harvard has written to the Chinese ambassador in Washington. McKinsey is in touch with Ms. Liu. People tracking the case say they hope President Trump will raise the issue at the Group of 20 summit meeting this week in Argentina, where he and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, are expected to meet.
China has convicted foreigners of crimes and even executed them. It has also detained Muslims who are foreign citizens in its northwest internment camp system. The exit bans are different â the authorities do not keep the people at a detention site or present a legal justification. They use the ban mainly as a means of coercion: to squeeze out information, to compel a relative or friend to return to China, or to force the victim to settle a business dispute.
In one case, an American stayed in China under an exit ban for more than two years. A continuing case involves a Singaporean national working for UBS, the Swiss bank, which has prompted UBS to issue travel warnings to its employees.
âMany police actions are now taken outside the legal system, and both Chinese citizens and foreigners, especially those who used to be Chinese citizens, have been kept in China with no apparent legal authority,â said Jerome A. Cohen, a law professor at New York University.
Chinaâs increasing use of the practice is a result of major trends: a growing disregard for civil rights among Chinese security forces; a sweeping anti-corruption campaign started by Mr. Xi in 2012; and a rush among corrupt officials and executives to move overseas with their families. In 2014, China announced the start of a global campaign to hunt down fugitive former officials.
Many of the former officials live overseas in luxury, with new names and citizenship. China has sent secret agents to the United States to try to retrieve some. China has also asked the United States to send back former officials, but the two countries do not have an extradition treaty.
American officials have been reluctant to cooperate because of Chinaâs human rights abuses and lack of rule of law, though there have been exceptions â including the repatriation of a former vice mayor accused of stealing $39 million.
The âNaked Officialâ
In 2007, Chinese auditors closed in on what was becoming the countryâs biggest bank fraud case. Liu Changming fled China that December, state media reported. The top official at the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications, he was at the center of the case.
Officials charged him in 2008 with making illegal loans of about 9.8 billion yuan, or $1.4 billion, including some to a company he secretly controlled, according to Caixin, a financial newsmagazine. Officials convicted Mr. Liuâs co-conspirators but recovered only half of the money.
In 2015, China put Mr. Liu on its âSkynetâ list of 100 most-wanted fugitives. Interpol issued a âred noticeâ for his arrest. His whereabouts are unknown.
The Financial Times reported in 2009 that after escaping China, Mr. Liu took part in shareholder meetings in London for Canton Property Investment Ltd., a company whose Chinese subsidiaries received the illegal loans. The company had gone public in London in August 2007 and raised $50 million, but was delisted the next year.
Public records show that a person named Changming Liu is linked to a home in Chestnut Hill, Mass. The address matches the one Cynthia Liu lists on her Harvard alumni page. The home is owned by Sandra Han, the mother. Zillow, the real estate website, estimates its value at $2.3 million.
A company controlled by Ms. Han bought the home in 2009. Several real estate companies, trusts and limited liability corporations are registered to that address, and they in turn own rental properties in Massachusetts and luxury apartments in New York.
While Mr. Liu was moving up the ranks of Chinaâs banking bureaucracy, he became what the Chinese call a ânaked officialâ â someone who settles his family abroad, with relatively easy paths to foreign citizenship and well-regarded schools, and with the Chinese authorities an ocean away.
The mother and daughter moved to California in 1998, and by early the next year they lived in a condominium in Alhambra, a Los Angeles suburb popular with Chinese immigrants. In June 1999, Mr. Liu and his wife bought a three-bedroom home in nearby Arcadia. Records show they obtained Social Security numbers in California around this time.
Their son Victor was born in California that July. He later lived in southern Chinese cities for five years, leaving Guangzhou in 2007.
The couple sold the Arcadia home in 2004 and bought a house in a gated community in Armonk, N.Y., an affluent town, records show. The home was transferred to Cynthia Liuâs name in 2011 and sold in 2014 for almost $900,000.
Ms. Han is a trustee of an entity called Bountiful Success Trust â 2014, which bought a $2.77 million condominium in downtown Manhattan in 2016. Another company she controls owns a unit at the Lucida on the Upper East Side that Zillow values at $4.17 million.
Like his mother and sister, Victor Liu is interested in business, and he rented a room this summer with Noor Darwish, his first-year roommate, in a Georgetown home to do an internship at his universityâs endowment office. But he left suddenly in June. He called Mr. Darwish as he was leaving the country.
âHe told me he had some family problems, and that his grandfather had had a heart attack,â Mr. Darwish said.
The university has strongly pushed for the siblingsâ release. On his trip to China this month, the Georgetown president, John J. DeGioia, met with senior officials. With him was Evan S. Medeiros, a professor who had helped negotiate releases of American hostages in North Korea as senior Asia director in President Barack Obamaâs National Security Council.
The university has a little-known connection to Chinaâs leadership. A nephew of Mr. Xi, Chinaâs president, is a recent graduate of Georgetownâs School of Foreign Service. While at Georgetown, he also interned at the Brookings Institution.
None of that has helped. With winter break looming, Mr. Liuâs friends on campus are asking why he has been absent all semester. âOur room is a lot lonelier now,â Mr. Darwish said.
In China, Mr. Liu has been eating and sleeping poorly. His sister mentioned concerns about her own health in her letter to the White House. She wrote, âWe feel alone, angry, and most of all afraid, and more than anything, we just want to come home.â

U.S.-China Trade Truce Gives Both Sides Political Breathing Room,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2148044402?accountid=14586,"The agreement reached by President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China to effectively pause their trade war and work toward a pact appears to be aimed at giving the two leaders some political breathing room after an escalating fight has begun inflicting economic damage on both sides of the Pacific.
The temporary truce, forged over a working dinner on Saturday night in Buenos Aires, does little to resolve the deep differences between the two nations and is more a political agreement than a substantive one. Both sides immediately positioned the cease-fire as a domestic victory while staking out areas where they would not compromise.
âItâs an incredible deal. It goes down, certainly â if it happens, it goes down as one of the largest deals ever made,â Mr. Trump told reporters late Saturday night aboard Air Force One.
[ Asian markets jumped on Monday after the deal , a sign of exuberance tempered by a sense that the fragile peace may not last . ]
Chinaâs foreign ministry in a statement characterized the meeting as âvery successful,â adding, âThe two sides proposed a series of constructive plans on how to properly resolve existing differences and problems.â
The political need for some type of truce has increased as both countries begin struggling with signs of economic softening. Chinaâs debt-heavy economy is slowing more than experts expected, while there are areas of emerging weakness in the United States as the effects of Mr. Trumpâs tax cuts and spending increases begin to wear off. The trade war has also started to bite American farmers and some manufacturers, while the United States stock market has erased almost all of its 2018 gains amid trade and economic jitters.
But the tough road to a more comprehensive trade deal could be seen in the disparity between the official statements released by the United States and China, with the two documents essentially disagreeing over what was agreed to by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi.
The United States emphasized the 90-day window it has set for trade talks, while China made no mention of it. And the White House, which has accused China of âstealingâ technology from American companies, said that Mr. Xi had agreed to ânegotiate immediately on forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers and cyber theft.â The statement from China said only that the two countries would âwork together to reach a consensus on trade issuesâ but did not mention intellectual property.
âThe president has been clear that if there is a real deal heâs willing to give some period of time to get this firmly negotiated â thatâs the direction heâs given to the team,â Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a telephone interview on Sunday. âOn the other hand, if thereâs not a real deal, he said he will proceed with the tariffs.â
The cease-fire leaves American tariffs in place on $250 billion in Chinese goods but it removes â for now â Mr. Trumpâs threat to increase the tariffs on $200 billion of those goods in January to 25 percent from 10 percent and to impose tariffs on all imports from China. The agreement sets a March 1 deadline for a trade deal, which is expected to be brokered by Mr. Mnuchin and Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative.
The agreement hints that the initial 25 percent tariffs that Mr. Trump placed on $50 billion in Chinese goods last summer could become permanent â if not in place for a protracted period. Those initial tariffs were intended to largely spare American consumers while targeting imports that the administration sees as a threat to national security â like nuclear reactor parts, spacecraft and aeronautical gear. The tariffs were also imposed on a variety of other products, like agricultural equipment, that Beijing has made a priority with its Made in China 2025 industrial policies program.
Mr. Mnuchin suggested that all the tariffs could be phased out as China meets its commitments to make changes over a period of time. It is possible that the initial tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports could be in place longer, until it is clear that China has kept its promises of wholesale structural changes.
âThe proposal that came back and was discussed between the presidents included both reducing the trade deficit and also included very specific structural issues,â he said. âIt includes commitments on technology, to currency to cyber. There are a lot of important issues to be addressed here.â
Waiting for China to actually carry out its trade promises is a high bar to set for removing the tariffs. American and Chinese negotiators have been wrangling over many of the same questions of intellectual property protection, investment access and other issues since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
Until Saturday evening, China had been insisting on an immediate repeal of all tariffs as part of any deal. âChina has emphasized many times that United States bullying and pressure arenât working with China,â Gao Feng, the Commerce Ministry spokesman, said in a briefing on Oct. 11.
But Saturdayâs deal left American tariffs in place while including a Chinese agreement to resume buying American agricultural and energy products. The dollar value of the Chinese resumption of purchases was not announced. But Chinaâs willingness to reach any deal for purchases while considerable tariffs remain in place suggested that Beijing officials, as well as Mr. Trump, were genuinely eager for a truce.
It is likely to be a source of tension within the Trump administration over how gradually China is allowed to make policy changes or if the president will insist on a rapid transformation. While Mr. Mnuchin has been an advocate for talks, other advisers, like Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, have warned Mr. Trump about agreeing to what would ultimately amount to a hollow deal.
In the interview, Mr. Mnuchin played down divisions within the economic team. He said that it was helpful to have Mr. Navarro, with whom he has occasionally clashed on trade policy, at the table to show the Chinese that the White House is a united front.
Mr. Mnuchin also said that China put a significant number on the table that went beyond the $70 billion of American goods that Beijing promised to purchase in June if Mr. Trump halted his tariffs.
China experts in the United States had mixed views about the agreement, with some expressing optimism that a dialogue would continue but others saying they feared that Chinaâs history of promising changes, but not delivering, would repeat itself. And they pointed to Mr. Lighthizerâs recent statements that China had made no progress toward addressing the administrationâs concerns as a harbinger for tough negotiations.
âWe put off tariffs for 90 days in exchange for the same things weâve been negotiating with the Chinese with for over a year,â said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute. âWhy would this 90 days make any difference?â
He added: âAre the Chinese going to change their development model in the next 90 days? No.â
The most important long-term consequence of Saturdayâs deal may be felt in the Chinese auto industry, which has been preparing for a big push into the American market as car sales have slumped sharply this autumn in the slowing Chinese economy.
Five Chinese automakers have disclosed plans to enter the American market in 2020. In mid-November, GAC, one of Chinaâs biggest automakers, showcased its vehicles, not to mention its global ambitions, at the annual auto show in Guangzhou, the southeastern Chinese city where the automaker is based.
âWe have accelerated internationalization plans and built a global network,â said Yu Jun, GACâs president, before projecting overhead a giant map with scarlet arrows fanning out from southern China to Europe, the Middle East and the United States.
Administration officials have said they hope to prevent a repeat of what happened from the 1970s to the 1990s, when an influx of Japanese and then South Korean cars resulted in heavy job losses in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin â states that Mr. Trump is counting on for his re-election campaign in 2020.
China is already the worldâs largest car market and biggest maker of cars and car parts. General Motors imports Buick Envision sport utility vehicles from its Chinese joint venture into the United States. Since July, it has faced a 25 percent American tariff on these vehicles, though it has asked the Trump administration to exempt them. The 25 percent tariff is in addition to the United Statesâ longstanding tariff of 2.5 percent on cars from all over the world.
By contrast, Chinaâs tariff on car imports from all over the world was 25 percent until last summer, when it cut the tariff to 15 percent. But China added a 25 percent tariff just on American cars over the summer, for a total of 40 percent, to retaliate against Mr. Trumpâs new tariffs.
In a cryptic tweet late Sunday night, Mr. Trump suggested that China would reduce those retaliatory tariffs on the small number of American cars exported to China. But Chinese statements on the weekend agreement included no mention of changes in auto tariffs.
Mr. Lighthizer, an Ohio native who played a key role in car sector negotiations with Japan in the 1980s as deputy United States trade representative under President Ronald Reagan, underlined the Trump administrationâs focus on cars last week by threatening to raise American tariffs on Chinese cars to 40 percent.
But Michael Dunne, the chief executive of ZoZo Go, a San Diego automotive consultant, said that even at 25 percent, the tariffs would discourage Chinese automakers. âIt gives them reason to pause and reset their strategy,â he said.
Mr. Dunne predicted that Chinese automakers would look for ways to assemble cars in the United States instead â just as Japanese automakers did in the 1980s and 1990s when they faced American trade barriers, initially shipping parts from Japan for assembly and later shifting supply chains to the United States.
But building factories is time consuming. And the Trump administration included some auto parts in the 25 percent tariffs last summer and a lot of auto parts in the 10 percent tariffs this autumn, which could prove costly for Chinese companies.

The Key to Stopping the Illegal Wildlife Trade: China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2150017330?accountid=14586,"Many of the creatures that share this planet with us may not be around much longer.
Since 1970, populations of thousands of animal species around the world have declined 60 percent on average, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Habitat destruction, climate change and pollution are all driving those losses.
But so is the global illegal trade in wildlife. For species like tigers and rhinos, poaching is a primary threat to survival.
âVery few ecosystems are not affected by wildlife trade,â said Vincent Nijman, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University in Britain. âIt directly impacts a very large number of species, and has a knock-on effect on many more species still.â
But, as Dr. Nijman pointed out, any solutions for tackling illegal wildlife trade are unlikely to work without the involvement of one major player: China.
From ivory to pangolin scales, totoaba bladders to shark fins, the country has a ravenous appetite for wildlife products. As Chinaâs economy and population have grown, so, too, has demand for animals and their parts, which are sought worldwide: in Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and the worldâs oceans.
âA lot of the species that are most threatened on Earth right now are threatened because of demand in China,â said Chris Shepherd, executive director of Monitor, a nonprofit group that works to reduce illegal wildlife trade. âChina has to become a leader in fighting illegal wildlife trade, or else itâs not going to be a pretty future.â
[ Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter. ]
Until recently, China seemed to have signed on to the cause. President Xi Jinping, who has pledged to turn the country into an âecological civilization,â stepped up seizures of contraband animal products and created a new national park to provide a haven for Siberian tigers. In January, Mr. Xi banned the domestic trade in ivory.
But lately China has sent conflicting signals. To the shock of officials and conservationists around the world, China announced last month that it would reopen the trade in rhino horn and tiger bone, reversing a 25-year domestic ban.
âThis development came as a surprise to us, because China, at the moment, is leading in so many ways on the environment,â said Erik Solheim, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program. âWe should be stepping up protection for tigers and rhinos, not lowering it.â
Chinaâs State Council directed that rhino horn and tiger bone be limited to use in scientific research and in traditional Chinese medicine, practiced by qualified doctors at certain hospitals.
Officials also pledged to strictly control trade, a reassurance that did little to assuage concerns that poaching was about to spiral even further out of control.
Indeed, just three days after Chinaâs announcement, Jose Louies, chief of the wildlife crime control division at the Wildlife Trust of India, received a call from an informant who said that tiger traffickers had begun anticipating a price increase.
âPoachers keep their ears to the ground â they feel everything that is happening in the market,â Mr. Louies said. âItâs not a secret for them that all the tiger materials are going to China.â
Following a global outcry, the State Council this month reversed course and postponed implementation of the order. But the episode has left conservationists wary â not least because the history here is far from encouraging.
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) banned international commercial trade of rhinos and most tigers in 1975. But for decades afterward, China permitted domestic sales of products made from these animals.
Rhino horn and tiger bone were smuggled into the country from abroad, and tiger farms were set up in the late 1980s â some with government backing â to breed big cats for bones, skins and parts. (Wild tigers had been mostly poached in China years earlier.)
In 1993, under a law called the Pelly Amendment, President Bill Clinton threatened China with sanctions for undermining the Cites treaty. China responded with a ban on rhino horn and tiger bone, and poaching declined significantly.
âBy banning those products, the Chinese government made a significant contribution to conservation of rhinos and tigers over the past twenty years,â said Zhang Li, a field biologist at the Beijing Normal University.
Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine quickly followed suit, replacing the banned materials with sustainable substitutes and removing tiger bone and rhino horn â which have no scientifically proven benefits â from textbooks and the pharmacopoeia.
âIf the governmentâs intention by lifting this ban is to support Chinese medicine, the result is the opposite,â said Lixin Huang, executive director of the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in California.
She suspects that the decision was encouraged not by practitioners of traditional medicine, but by âthose dealing in the business of profit-makingâ â tiger farmers.
Rather than shutter after the 1993 ban, tiger farms continued to grow and now house over 6,000 captive animals. For over a decade, China has expressed interest in domestic trade of its captive tigersâ parts.
In September, Cites identified 36 Chinese tiger farms that seemed to be involved in illegal trade or else held tigers in questionably excessive numbers.
But at a Cites meeting last month in Sochi, Russia, Chinese officials strongly opposed the findings, according to Heather Sohl, a chief adviser at the World Wildlife Fund who attended the meeting.
Officials did not mention the countryâs impending decision to reopen trade.
âChina has quite often restricted progress on tackling tiger trade discussions we have at Cites,â Ms. Sohl said. The fact that officials questioned proposals to control tiger trade âwasnât unusual and didnât give us any insight that this was coming.â
Michael ât Sas-Rolfes, a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford who toured tiger farms at the invitation of the Chinese government in 2007, was not surprised.
âThe only part of this that was completely unexpected for me was the timing,â he said. âThe Chinese focus has always been more on conserving a species as a resource, not on the Western focus of conserving a species in its habitat.â
Even as Western countries have pushed for blanket bans on certain wildlife products, he continued, demand for those products in certain quarters of Asia has not fallen. Instead, illegal trade and the profits to be made from it have increased.
âIâm hoping that Chinaâs move may serve as a bit of a wake-up call that the âjust say noâ approach doesnât work,â Mr. ât Sas-Rolfes said.
âThe conversation on drugs has evolved into something more sophisticated â smoking pot is not the same as shooting up with heroin. And we need to apply the same nuanced, evidence-based thinking to wildlife trade.â

Some are eager to see Chinaâs markets reopen.
âRather than criminals coming here, wantonly killing our animals, we can now supply horn from stockpiles to meet the demand and take pressure away from wild populations,â said Pelham Jones, chairman of the Private Rhino Owners Association in South Africa.
Chinaâs directive specified that tiger bones and rhino horns must come from farmed animals, but not that they be farmed in China. Conservationists believe the number of rhinos in China to be very small.
By contrast, over 7,000 rhinos live on at least 300 private ranches in South Africa. Nearly 90 percent of rhino owners are keen to sell their animalsâ horns, which can be clipped every few years.
The profits, they say, will help cover the steep security costs of keeping poachers at bay.
âThereâs only one country in the world that can meet Chinaâs demand, and thatâs South Africa,â Mr. Jones said.
Whether a proposal to reopen international trade of rhino horn could pass at Cites depends on a number of technicalities in the treaty and on whether proponents could rally enough support.
Cites currently states that countries should not breed tigers for their parts â only for conservation â and that they should reduce their use of rhino horn. But Cites governs only international trade, so provisions in the treaty about domestic trade do not carry the same enforceable legal weight.
The United States has started looking into options of its own for ensuring that Chinaâs domestic ban on tiger and rhino trade remains in place, said Christine Dawson, director of the office of conservation and water at the State Department. That includes the possibility of recertifying China under the Pelly Amendment, which would pave the way for sanctions.
âThereâs a lot at stake for these two major economies, and the leverage may never be better for the U.S. to fold this issue into the broader trade issues going on right now,â said David J. Hayes, executive director of the State Energy & Environmental Impact Center at New York University.
Mr. ât Sas-Rolfes pointed out, however, that the Pelly Amendment might have lost its potency in a China with rising influence on the world stage. In any event, officials now may simply decide not to follow through with the directive.
âLet us hope that China recognizes the stark inconsistency of this decision with its laudable stance on ivory, and takes steps to ban the trade of rhino horn and tiger bones altogether,â said Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary of Britain.
Whatever comes of the tiger bone and rhino horn controversy, Dr. Nijman emphasized that global collaboration â and perhaps compromise â with China might be key to solving the much bigger challenge of illegal wildlife trade.
âThat means trying to better understand the Chinese way of thinking and working directly with them for solutions,â he said. âThe solutions may not be the ones we initially thought were perhaps best from our Western perspective, but ultimately they may be the only way forward.â

"Europe and U.S. Agree on Chinese Threat, but Are Too Busy Feuding to Fight It","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2153718912?accountid=14586,"BRUSSELS â They are creating defenses to limit Chinese investment, accusing China of seizing technology from foreign companies and warning of Chinese efforts to undermine their political system.
It may all sound like a game plan hatched by officials in Washington, but the agenda is straight out of Brussels. While President Trump battles China over the issue of trade, Europe is in the midst of a conflict with Beijing that, in its own way, is just as intense.
European leaders have become increasingly alarmed by what they consider Chinaâs aggressive incursions into the continentâs economy, including paying $23 million to expand port facilities in Bulgaria, providing $3.8 billion in financing for a high-speed railroad connecting Hungary and Serbia and acquiring a German robotics company that employs 14,000 people worldwide.
Now, Brussels is passing laws to counter Chinaâs influence in the region. Last month, in a move clearly directed at China, European lawmakers and political leaders agreed on a system to scrutinize investments in the 28-member bloc as a way of protecting key industries.
âWe want to have a better overview when certain critical infrastructure is targeted by them,â Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told an audience in Brussels last month.
European politicians are also frustrated that although they have many of the same concerns as their American counterparts about China, there has been little cooperation or coordination in their strategies. Rather than joining forces to contain Chinaâs economic expansionism, the Trump administration has treated Europe with disdain.
âWe had some serious differences in the past,â Marietje Schaake, the vice chairman of the European Parliamentâs delegation for relations with the United States, said in an interview. âBut it has become much more confrontational, at the worst possible moment. We need to stand together as defenders of the liberal order.â
There were signs of a possible thaw after Mr. Trump and members of his administration met with German car executives at the White House on Tuesday. Those on both sides described the atmosphere as friendly.
Representatives of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen described plans to expand manufacturing in the United States, which could tamp down Mr. Trumpâs complaints that Europe exports far more cars to America than the other way around. His threat to impose tariffs on imported cars receded for the moment, representatives of Volkswagen and Daimler said.
Some White House officials, including Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, have consistently argued that friction with Europe is a distraction from the more urgent task of reining in China. And behind the scenes, Ms. Malmstrom said, American, European and Japanese officials are having âquite constructive discussionsâ about trade with China.
But conversations with officials in Brussels make it clear that the relationship between the European Union and the United States has deteriorated significantly since Mr. Trump took office, and they are unsure how or if it can be salvaged.
In response to Mr. Trumpâs claims that Europe treats American products unfairly, representatives of the European Commission and the United States government have tried to dismantle barriers to trade in industries like pharmaceuticals, medical devices and even shellfish. But several participants in the talks said European and American officials have been completely out of sync, making it difficult to achieve progress.
Each side accuses the other of obstructionism. The Americans have expressed frustration with the Europeansâ insistence on assembling a consensus among its 28 member countries before agreeing to anything. White House officials have told the Europeans directly that they believe they are stalling, in hopes of waiting out the Trump administration.
âSo long as the E.U. leadership plays the delay game, the more we will have to use leverage to realign the relationship,â Gordon Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, told an audience in Brussels last month. âBut some believe they can delay and wait out this president.â
Mr. Sondland spoke of missed opportunities for the United States and Europe to join forces against what he described as âChinaâs persistent and unfair trade practices,â but there have been examples of cooperation.
In September, Mr. Lighthizer and his counterparts from Japan and the European Union met in New York and issued a joint statement against unfair competition by companies that are either owned by governments or subsidized, a clear dig at China.
But the Europeans have accused the White House of repeatedly poisoning the atmosphere with its raw, transactional approach to relations. They were floored when, at the end of May, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Europe, while threatening to impose levies on foreign-made cars and car parts.
âThat was a shocking experience, that the U.S. administration is ready to impose tariffs against Europe,â said Jeppe Kofod, a Danish member of the European Parliament who has met several times during the past year with Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, and other American officials.
Mr. Kofod said he first realized the depth of the Trump administrationâs antagonism toward Europe during a lunch in Washington late last year with Mr. Ross and a delegation from the European Parliament. The meal, in a room at the Library of Congress with a view of the Capitol, began on a cordial note, Mr. Kofod recalled. But then Mr. Ross began attacking what he said were Europeâs unfair trade practices.
âWe appealed to him that we should take on China together,â Mr. Kofod said. âHe said, âNo, you are as bad as China.ââ
Mr. Ross said he remembered the conversation differently. âWhat I said was that both Europe and China espouse free trade rhetoric but are in reality much more protectionist than the United States,â Mr. Ross said in a statement on Friday.
The prospect of auto tariffs brought Europe to the negotiating table, he said. âEurope showed little interest in trade negotiations before that.â
In some ways, China is even more of a threat to Europe than it is to the United States. In America, cheap products from China are blamed for hollowing out the industrial heartland. Europe has been though the same thing. In the tumultuous last decade of financial and debt crises, Chinaâs efforts to expand its economic portfolio and pursue manufacturing around the world left Europe with fewer well-paying, middle-class jobs at home.
The European Commission, the unionâs administrative arm, has fought a long-running battle to protect its steel industry from subsidized Chinese competitors. Low-price solar cells made in China devastated Germanyâs attempts to cultivate a solar-cell industry in the last decade.
China has acquired significant assets across Europe in recent years. During the debt crisis that unnerved the most vulnerable economies in Europe, China invested in ports in Portugal and Greece and even bought a stake in Italyâs electrical grid. Chinese investment in Europe totaled $40 billion last year, compared with $29 billion in the United States, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm.
The financing from China has often been welcome. Chinese investors were willing to put money into distressed companies shunned by others. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group has revived Volvo Cars since buying it from Ford in 2010, and has helped to rejuvenate the region around Gothenburg, Sweden, the port city where Volvo has its headquarters.
But European sentiment toward China shifted in 2016 after Midea, a Chinese appliance manufacturer, bought Kuka, a German maker of industrial robots for 4 billion euros, or $4.6 billion.
Kuka robots are ubiquitous in car factories around the world, and the company was an example of German technological leadership in a growing industry. Mideaâs acquisition of the company caused a political furor because Germans feared the Chinese would gain control of Kukaâs expertise as factories were becoming increasingly automated. But German political leaders had few legal tools to intervene.
The decision in Brussels last month to give the European Union more power to block such acquisitions was, in large part, inspired by the Kuka deal and the inability of political leaders to protect sensitive technology.
European leaders are also worried that China is trying to disrupt European unity. Since 2012, China has been holding summit meetings with 11 eastern European Union countries and five Balkan countries, an effort called 16+1. The groupâs stated purpose is to promote business ties and investment. One example is a project to upgrade freight transport facilities in the Bulgarian port of Burgas on the Black Sea.
But 16+1 is also seen as an attempt to exploit tensions between wealthier Western European countries and formerly Communist countries like Hungary. Unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the Chinese do not nag Viktor Orban, Hungaryâs authoritarian prime minister, about policies that are seen as a threat to democracy. A bank controlled by the Chinese government is financing improvements to the rail line between Belgrade and Budapest.
So even if the United States and Europe share many of the same objections to Chinese economic policy, they are far apart on what to do about it. Mr. Trump has used tariffs and threats of tariffs to put pressure on China, and has been unconventional in his approach. Mr. Trump sees international trade as a deal, by him and with him, to be made personally with President Xi Jinping of China.
The Europeans want to preserve the World Trade Organization as the forum to resolve conflicts. Last month the European Commission proposed changes to the organizationâs rules that were drawn up in part to allay American concerns about the panel that adjudicates trade disputes. The reforms would place limits on the legal issues the appeals panel can consider, a response to complaints by the United States that it often oversteps its mandate.
The proposals found an unlikely ally. China was among 11 other countries that backed the reforms. The United States did not. A spokeswoman for the United States mission in Geneva, where the trade organization is based, declined to comment.
âThatâs what we try to tell our American friends,â Ms. Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, told a small group of reporters at a briefing in Brussels last month, two weeks after returning from talks in Washington. âLetâs work together. When we work together we have a lot of impact.â

Whoâs in the Middle of a Spat Between the U.S. and China? Canada,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2156117022?accountid=14586,"Correction Appended
TORONTO â The United States and China are embroiled in a tense trade war that seemed headed for escalation after the United States accused a top Chinese technology executive of fraud.
Who has China lashed out at?
Canada.
Furious at the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, China has seized at least two Canadians. Chinese social media users are clamoring for a boycott of Canadaâs products. Anxious Canadians are wondering if they should scrap trips to China or urge relatives there to come home.
Canada is in a tricky spot, boxed in the middle between its two largest trading partners, and worried about having to choose sides.
[Want more Canada coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our free weekly Canada Letter newsletter.]
After feeling burned by negotiations to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, the country is trying to strengthen trade relations with China in part to lessen dependence on economic ties to the United States. And many Canadians are wary of what they consider President Trumpâs capricious view of Canada.
âCanada is between a rock and a hard place,â said Wenran Jiang, a senior fellow at the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia.
Mr. Trumpâs relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been chilly at best this year. Now, with the extradition process unfolding in the next months, Mr. Trudeau risks alienating China as well.
As of Thursday evening there was no word on where China was holding the two seized Canadians, Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a writer and entrepreneur. Canadian consular officials have not been able to see them.
Both face charges of undermining Chinaâs national security.
Chinaâs announcement that it was holding them further complicated what has now become a crisis entangling all three countries. It arose from the bitter trade dispute between China and the United States and the American extradition case against Ms. Meng, who was arrested nearly two weeks ago.
Ms. Meng, an affluent business celebrity in China, was freed on bail Tuesday by a court in Vancouver, where she was detained at the request of the United States on suspicion of violating American sanctions against Iran. When or whether she will be extradited remains unclear.
Unswayed by the bail release, China has demanded that Canada free Ms. Meng immediately, seeing her arrest as a sneaky political ploy engineered by the Americans.
Canada has said it was abiding by the laws governing an extradition agreement with the United States. But that reasoning has only further infuriated China.
The anger was seen in an opinion piece by Chinaâs ambassador to Canada, Lu Shaye, published Thursday in the Globe and Mail.
âThe detention of Ms. Meng is not a mere judicial case, but a premeditated political action in which the United States wields its regime power to witch-hunt a Chinese high-tech company out of political consideration,â Mr. Lu wrote. âThe so-called long-arm jurisdiction of the United States, however, has no legal basis in international law.â
Those who accuse China of retaliatory detentions over Ms. Mengâs arrest, he suggested, âshould first reflect on the actions of the Canadian side.â He added, âIt is both ignominious and hypocritical to revile China with double standards.â
Mr. Jiang said that to many Chinese, it appeared â fairly or not â that Canada had been âdoing the dirty work of the Americans, in what seems like a tactic for a U.S. trade war with China.â
A former Canadian ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques, said the dispute would likely worsen and beckon an economic backlash by China, the worldâs second largest economy behind the United States.
âThey will start to increase pressure, canceling contracts maybe stopping shipments to China of key exports like canola, pork and beef,â Mr. Saint-Jacques said.
Some suggested Ms. Mengâs challenge to extradition had been strengthened because of a remark by Mr. Trump in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday.
Mr. Trump implied he would intervene in her extradition if it would help land a trade deal with China. By tying the two, Mr. Trump may have inadvertently given Ms. Meng a way to avoid extradition by arguing that her arrest is a politically motivated case, in which the bar for extradition is far higher.
âHeâs handed ammunition to Ms. Mengâs lawyers,â said Robert Currie, a professor of law with expertise on extradition at Dalhousie University in Halifax.
Normally extraditions to the United States are not much of an issue in Canada and are mostly granted.
But Ms. Mengâs lawyers could argue that âsheâs being used as a proxy in a trade war, and weâre not sure she will get a fair trial in the United States,â Professor Currie said. âItâs not just about criminal law anymore. Itâs about politics.â
Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland of Canada clearly saw the implications of Mr. Trumpâs remarks.
âOur extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice,â she told a news conference on Wednesday.
On Friday, Ms. Freeland is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, part of a previously scheduled dialogue that also includes the top defense officials from the two governments. The subject of Ms. Meng, the two Canadian detainees in China and pressure from the Chinese government will no doubt be discussed.
The arrests in China have sent a chill through Canadians who work and travel regularly to the country. Mr. Saint Jacques said he has heard from a number professionals who have postponed business trips to China.
âThere is a rising fear that anyone else could be arrested at random, especially since we know China doesnât have the same definition of national security,â he said. âIt is pretty elastic and very broad.â
Extradition can take months in Canada.
First a Canadian judge must be convinced of the case, and then the countryâs justice minister must approve. If either decision is appealed, the process can drag on for years, Mr. Currie said.
But, in Ms. Mengâs case, her lawyers could try to get the extradition order quashed preemptively based on political involvement, he said.
âAt the moment, both the president of the United States and the government of China seem to be interfering in our legal process,â Mr. Currie said. The governmentâs priority now, he said, is âdefending Canada sovereignty and defending the Canadian legal process.â
What this may mean for the fate of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor is unclear at best. But it appears that Chinaâs security apparatus had been monitoring them for awhile.
Mr. Kovrig, the former diplomat, was first secretary and vice consul at Canadaâs Beijing embassy from 2014 to 2016. More recently he had been working as a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization that moved its Beijing office to Hong Kong a few years ago amid tightened Chinese restrictions on such foreign organizations.
He was regarded as a Sinophile, fluent in Mandarin, who had spent years investigating sensitive subjects such as the rights of Chinese ethnic minorities.
Mr. Spavor saw himself as a sort of adventurer, writer, fixer, consultant and mediator between the West and reclusive North Korea.
He helped to arrange a high-profile visit to North Korea in 2016 by Dennis Rodman, the basketball star, and boasted that he had even met Kim Jong-un, the Northâs enigmatic leader, and had posed for a photograph with him, laughing and shaking hands, that he displayed on social media.
Over the past year, Canada has been trying to start free trade talks with China in an effort to diversify an economy that is heavily reliant on the United States.
But the new North American trade deal finally signed this past fall contained a contentious clause that many saw as a blatant push by the United States to block any free trade deal between China and Canada.
The clause â which became widely known as the âChina clauseâ â laid out consequences for any member country for negotiating another trade deal with ânonmarket economies.â
The Chinese Embassy in Canada saw the clause as an affront. It issued a statement deploring the âhegemonic actions taken by some country which blatantly interferes with other countryâs sovereignty.â

How McKinsey Has Helped Raise the Stature of Authoritarian Governments,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2157024856?accountid=14586,"This yearâs McKinsey & Company retreat in China was one to remember.
Hundreds of the companyâs consultants frolicked in the desert, riding camels over sand dunes and mingling in tents linked by red carpets. Meetings took place in a cavernous banquet hall that resembled a sultanâs ornate court, with a sign overhead to capture the mood.
âI canât keep calm, I work at McKinsey & Company,â it said.
Especially remarkable was the location: Kashgar, the ancient Silk Road city in Chinaâs far west that is experiencing a major humanitarian crisis.
About four miles from where the McKinsey consultants discussed their work, which includes advising some of Chinaâs most important state-owned companies, a sprawling internment camp had sprung up to hold thousands of ethnic Uighurs â part of a vast archipelago of indoctrination camps where the Chinese government has locked up as many as one million people.
One week before the McKinsey event, a United Nations committee had denounced the mass detentions and urged China to stop.
But the political backdrop did not appear to bother the McKinsey consultants, who posted pictures on Instagram chronicling their Disney-like adventures. In fact, McKinseyâs involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.
For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke Chinaâs transition from an economic laggard to the worldâs second-largest economy. But as Chinaâs growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijingâs signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.
One of McKinseyâs state-owned clients has even helped build Chinaâs artificial islands in the South China Sea, a major point of military tension with the United States.
It turns out that McKinseyâs role in China is just one example of its extensive â and sometimes contentious â work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.
At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.
Its clients have included Saudi Arabiaâs absolute monarchy, Turkey under the autocratic leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and corruption-plagued governments in countries like South Africa.
In Ukraine, McKinsey and Paul Manafort â President Trumpâs campaign chairman, later convicted of financial fraud â were paid by the same oligarch to help burnish the image of a disgraced presidential candidate, Viktor F. Yanukovych, recasting him as a reformer.
Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.
Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments â companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.
It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian governmentâs energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.
In August, VEB Bank â which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions â hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.
There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putinâs autocratic leadership.
Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the worldâs most admired companies.
In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies â the ones carrying out some of the governmentâs most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.
While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with Chinaâs state-owned companies, McKinseyâs role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asiaâs most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.
McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the companyâs values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations â that change is best achieved from the inside.
âSince 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,â the company said in a statement.
âTens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,â it added.
âLike many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,â the company said, âbut we do not support or engage in political activities.â
Still, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinseyâs role in a different light.
While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights â sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of Americaâs biggest rivals.
âIt is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,â said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. âThey donât want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.â
Oligarchs and Autocrats
His bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.
So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.
McKinseyâs role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovychâs political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trumpâs former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.
But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics â before discarding much of it after becoming president.
On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a rÃ©sumÃ© that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.
His name: Rinat Akhmetov, the countryâs richest oligarch. As much as anyone, he was the reason for the gathering, and he had reason to feel good.
He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the worldâs most important corporations.
That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetovâs vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.
Mr. Manafortâs job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovychâs reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different â an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.
To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was âa strong McKinsey supporter,â while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides âto work directly with McKinsey experts.â
Diplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might âsing a song one moment and knife someone the next.â
There were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for âmobsters and oligarchs,â noting that it might be trying to shed that image.
Mr. Akhmetovâs financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.
Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.
McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey â and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.
To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy â one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinseyâs work was well received.
But the promise of a better future didnât last long.
Within a few years, Ukraine careened toward economic collapse while Mr. Yanukovych looted the nation, living in a palatial residence surrounded by a private zoo, a golf course, a garage filled with classic cars and a private restaurant in the form of a pirate ship.
If that were not enough, he was also quietly building an enormous seaside retreat, complete with 40-foot ceilings and an indoor swimming pool, that eclipsed his presidential residence.
The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.
Protesters flooded the streets for months, chanting pro-Europe slogans. Mr. Yanukovychâs government responded with a heavy hand, culminating in what the European Parliamentâs envoy called a âUkrainian Tiananmen,â referring to Chinaâs deadly crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. More than 80 protesters were killed before Mr. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014.
The chaos didnât end there. Outraged, Mr. Putin pushed into Ukraine, annexed Crimea and stirred up a war that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. The West responded by kicking Russia out of the Group of 8 industrialized democracies and imposing sanctions. The standoff between Mr. Putin and the West had begun.
McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovychâs rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded â without achieving its goals â just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.
âWhen we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,â McKinsey said in a statement.
Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will âto embrace the reform agenda.â
But critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovychâs image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych âwas about power and robbery.â
McKinseyâs role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovychâs downfall. âWe build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraineâs major companies, its economy and society,â the company wrote on its website
McKinsey quickly became a favorite of Mr. Yanukovychâs successor, Petro O. Poroshenko, an oligarch known as âthe chocolate kingâ for his confectionary business.
In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.
Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.
Building Chinaâs Dream
Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.
It is supposed to be a railway â part of Chinaâs signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.
Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.
China Communications, which was barred for eight years from doing business on some World Bank projects because of a corruption scandal, played a leading role in building artificial islands in the South China Sea that have raised tensions with the United States.
The companyâs subsidiary also built a new port for Sri Lanka. But the debt turned out to be such a burden that the Sri Lankan government had to give up the port and hand it over for 99 years â to China.
Sri Lankaâs fate was so alarming that Malaysiaâs new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, worried that the same thing might happen to him. So he suspended the railway project in July.
âThat is not good for us,â Mr. Mahathir said in September. âMalaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.â
But for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.
In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.
Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.
In a confidential PowerPoint report, McKinsey told Malaysian officials that the rail line could increase economic growth in parts of the country by as much as 1.5 percent. It was a figure that the prime minister at the time, Najib Razak, who now has been charged with corruption, liked to cite.
In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China â âbuild the nation-to-nation relationshipâ â because of its importance in Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative.
And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a âgame changerâ elsewhere in the region.
It isnât hard to see where McKinseyâs enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.
Dominic Barton, McKinseyâs managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.
McKinseyâs in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports â widely cited in the Chinese state news media â extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.
Mr. Barton â who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative â also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand Chinaâs global influence.
âThe world is waiting for the âOne Belt, One Roadâ grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,â Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the companyâs Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinseyâs enthusiasm to work on it.
The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.
In 2016, McKinseyâs client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.
The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinseyâs clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.
Tony Pua, a Malaysian lawmaker and an aide to the finance minister, said the deal was brokered by a hard-partying Malaysian businessman named Jho Low, who is accused of siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars from the fund and is now believed to be in China, avoiding a Malaysian arrest warrant.
McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss Chinaâs sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.
âOur firmâs rigorous internal policies and proceduresâ ensure that âwe bring an independent perspectiveâ to help each client âpursue its own strategic goals,â McKinsey said.
But the political backdrop â a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks â should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.
âThey were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,â Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.
A Special Relationship
It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.
The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.
The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the worldâs biggest insurers.
McKinseyâs success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it â unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends â into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the Peopleâs Republic of China.
Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.
Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the countryâs vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became Chinaâs premier, putting him in charge of running the government.
At the time, McKinseyâs client, Ping An, was preparing for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Wen family and its business associates became secret shareholders of Ping An, having acquired their stakes at low cost in late 2002. And as premier, Mr. Wen presided over Chinaâs cabinet, which oversaw the insurance industry and signed off on big I.P.O.s.
According to McKinsey, Mr. Liu left the company in July 2003. Itâs not clear whether he played any role in his extended familyâs business activities. But when Ping An went public the next year, the Wen family amassed a staggering fortune, largely in company stock. By 2007, the family was worth at least $2.7 billion.
Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at Chinaâs banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he ânever worked on any projects for the firmâs Chinese clients,â and that it would be âmisleadingâ to connect him with McKinseyâs work for Ping An.
McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.
âAny suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,â the company said.
Today, Chinaâs best and brightest clamor to work at McKinsey. Partners in the firm have sat in on Communist Party meetings at companies. More than 90 percent of the companyâs 350 consultants in China are of Chinese descent, according to its website.
And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firmâs last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.
McKinseyâs name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the companyâs Chinese name.
The copycat firm â Chengdu McKinsey Management Consulting Company â even won a contract to advise Sichuan Province on its economic planning. Its ruse was so successful that the China Economic Weekly, a magazine under the Communist Partyâs mouthpiece Peopleâs Daily, wrote a cover article about the spreading influence of the real McKinsey, likening it to an octopus, and marveling at the success of the fake one.
McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.
The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like âSmart Cities,â worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen Chinaâs surveillance state.
The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.
âPolice patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,â McKinsey wrote in a report in June.
âIt is about political control,â said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.
The company has also championed â even parroted, critics say â the Chinese governmentâs âMade in China 2025â initiative to become a global leader in sensitive fields like artificial intelligence and aerospace, a policy rattling European and American leaders who fear the plans will undermine their economies and set the stage for Chinese dominance.
In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that âthrough the âMade in China 2025â plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the worldâs most advanced industries.â
McKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on âMade in China 2025.â But earlier this year, Chinaâs government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinseyâs reports also stopped mentioning the policy.
âThey sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the Peopleâs Daily,â George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. âObviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way â sometimes not so subtle.â
Clients Under Sanctions
When Senate investigators wanted to know why Jared Kushner, Mr. Trumpâs son-in-law, met with the head of a Russian bank under sanctions shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Kushner explained that, as far as he had been told, the bank chief had âa direct line to the Russian president.â
It is easy to see how. The bank â Vnesheconombank, or VEB â is owned by the Russian government and overseen directly by Mr. Putinâs inner circle. The bankâs former chief â the one Mr. Kushner met â graduated from the training school of the F.S.B., the successor agency of the K.G.B. The bank has also come under scrutiny in Congress and by the special counsel investigating possible collusion in the 2016 election.
And the bank is a McKinsey client.
In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy â one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.
Sberbank â a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trumpâs Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 â is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.
Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.
McKinseyâs work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.
McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.
McKinsey clients help expand Russiaâs reach abroad. One of them â PhosAgro, a fertilizer giant with ties to the Kremlin â is pushing hard for new regulations that would give it greater control over Europeâs food supply. The European Union already had concerns about Russian influence over its natural gas supply, much of which came from Gazprom, another Russian company under sanctions that McKinsey has advised on strategy and pricing.
McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia â or anywhere in the world â only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.
The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.
And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.
Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.
âBut what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia â in all three of those instances â that belief has not proven to be true,â he said.
China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there âhave nothing to point toâ showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.
In some cases, McKinseyâs work may have made things worse.
The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabiaâs most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.
One was later arrested, according to a human rights group. Another said that Saudi government officials had imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone. The third â an anonymous account â was shut down.
McKinsey said it was âhorrified by the possibility, however remote,â that the report could have been misused. But the kingdom is a such a vital client for the firm â the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone â that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October even after the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents.
âThe world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,â said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending âtheir reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.â
For 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls âthe black box of authoritarian governance.â
âEven if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,â Ms. Jones wrote.
Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.
âIn the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,â she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.
âThey engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,â she said. âThey self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.â
Outside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as âthe number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.â
The expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs âlike bats leaving a cave.â

Chinaâs âBelt and Roadâ Plan in Pakistan Takes a Military Turn,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2159883125?accountid=14586,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â When President Trump started the new year by suspending billions of dollars of security aid to Pakistan, one theory was that it would scare the Pakistani military into cooperating better with its American allies.
The reality was that Pakistan already had a replacement sponsor lined up.
Just two weeks later, the Pakistani Air Force and Chinese officials were putting the final touches on a secret proposal to expand Pakistanâs building of Chinese military jets, weaponry and other hardware. The confidential plan, reviewed by The New York Times, would also deepen the cooperation between China and Pakistan in space, a frontier the Pentagon recently said Beijing was trying to militarize after decades of playing catch-up.
All those military projects were designated as part of Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion chain of infrastructure development programs stretching across some 70 countries, built and financed by Beijing.
Chinese officials have repeatedly said the Belt and Road is purely an economic project with peaceful intent. But with its plan for Pakistan, China is for the first time explicitly tying a Belt and Road proposal to its military ambitions â and confirming the concerns of a host of nations who suspect the infrastructure initiative is really about helping China project armed might.
As Chinaâs strategically located and nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan has been the leading example of how the Chinese projects are being used to give Beijing both favor and leverage among its clients.
Since the beginning of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, Pakistan has been the programâs flagship site, with some $62 billion in projects planned in the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. In the process, China has lent more and more money to Pakistan at a time of economic desperation there, binding the two countries ever closer.
For the most part, Pakistan has eagerly turned more toward China as the chill with the United States has deepened. Some Pakistani officials are growing concerned about losing sovereignty to their deep-pocketed Asian ally, but the host of ways the two countries are now bound together may leave Pakistan with little choice but to go along.
Even before the revelation of the new Chinese-Pakistani military cooperation, some of Chinaâs biggest projects in Pakistan had clear strategic implications.
A Chinese-built seaport and special economic zone in the Pakistani town of Gwadar is rooted in trade, giving China a quicker route to get goods to the Arabian Sea. But it also gives Beijing a strategic card to play against India and the United States if tensions worsen to the point of naval blockades as the two powers increasingly confront each other at sea.
A less scrutinized component of Belt and Road is the central role Pakistan plays in Chinaâs Beidou satellite navigation system. Pakistan is the only other country that has been granted access to the systemâs military service, allowing more precise guidance for missiles, ships and aircraft.
The cooperation is meant to be a blueprint for Beidouâs expansion to other Belt and Road nations, however, ostensibly ending its clientsâ reliance on the American military-run GPS network that Chinese officials fear is monitored and manipulated by the United States.
[Read The Timesâs series âChina Rules,â about how China wrote its playbook to counter the West.]
In Pakistan, China has found an amenable ally with much to recommend it: shared borders and a long history of cooperation; a hedge in South Asia against India; a large market for arms sales and trade with potential for growth; a wealth of natural resources.
Now, China is also finding a better showcase for its security and surveillance technology in a place once defined by its close military relationship with the United States.
âThe focus of Belt and Road is on roads and bridges and ports, because those are the concrete construction projects that people can easily see. But itâs the technologies of the future and technologies of future security systems that could be the biggest security threat in the Belt and Road project,â said Priscilla Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, a cyberthreat intelligence monitoring company based in Massachusetts.
An Asset on the Sea
The tightening China-Pakistan security alliance has gained momentum on a long road to the Arabian Sea.
In 2015, under Belt and Road, China took a nascent port in the Pakistani coastal town of Gwadar and supercharged the project with an estimated $800 million development plan that included a large special economic zone for Chinese companies.
Linking the port to western China would be a new 2,000-mile network of highways and rails through the most forbidding stretch of Pakistan: Baluchistan Province, a resource-rich region plagued by militancy.
The public vision for the project was that it would allow Chinese goods to bypass much longer and more expensive shipping routes through the Indian Ocean and avoid the territorial waters of several American allies in Asia.
From the beginning, though, key details of the project were kept from the public and lawmakers, officials say, including the terms of its loan structure and the length of the lease, more than 40 years, that a Chinese state-owned company secured to operate the port.
If there was concern within Pakistan about the hidden costs of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, also known as CPEC, there was growing suspicion abroad about a hidden military aspect, as well.
In recent years, Chinese state-owned companies have built or begun constructing seaports at strategic spots around the Indian Ocean, including places in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Malaysia.
Chinese officials insisted that the ports would not be militarized. But analysts began wondering whether Chinaâs endgame was to muscle its way onto coastal territories that could become prime military assets â much as it did when it started militarizing contested islands in the South China Sea.
Then, Sri Lanka, unable to repay its ballooning debt with China, handed over the Chinese-built port at Hambantota in a 99-year lease agreement last year. Indian and American officials expressed a growing conviction that taking control of the port had been Chinaâs intent all along.
In October, Vice President Mike Pence said Sri Lanka was a warning for all Belt and Road countries that China was luring them into debt traps.
âChina uses so-called debt diplomacy to expand its influence,â Mr. Pence said in a speech.
âJust ask Sri Lanka, which took on massive debt to let Chinese state companies build a port of questionable commercial value,â Mr. Pence added. âIt may soon become a forward military base for Chinaâs growing blue-water navy.â
Military analysts predict that China could use Gwadar to expand the naval footprint of its attack submarines, after agreeing in 2015 to sell eight submarines to Pakistan in a deal worth up to $6 billion. China could use the equipment it sells to the South Asian country to refuel its own submarines, extending its navyâs global reach.
Deepening Debt
When China inaugurated Belt and Road, in 2013, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifâs new government in Pakistan saw it as the answer for a host of problems.
Foreign investment in Pakistan was scant, driven away by terrorist attacks and the countryâs enduring reputation for corruption. And Pakistan desperately needed a modern power grid to help ease persistent electricity shortages.
Pakistani officials say that Beijing first proposed the highway from Chinaâs western Xinjiang region through Pakistan that connected to Gwadar port. But Pakistani officials insisted that new coal power plants be built. China agreed.
With CPEC under fresh scrutiny, Chinese and Pakistani officials in recent weeks have contended that Pakistan has a debt problem, but not a Chinese debt problem. In October, the countryâs central bank revealed an overall debt and liability burden of about $215 billion, with $95 billion externally held. With nearly half of CPECâs projects completed â in terms of worth â Pakistan currently owes China $23 billion.
But the country stands to owe $62 billion to China â before interest balloons the figure to some $90 billion â under the plan for Belt and Roadâs expansion there in coming years.
Pakistanâs central bank governor, Ashraf Wathra, said publicly in 2015 that he had no clarity on Chinese investments in Pakistan and was concerned about rising debt levels. It still took him months after that to secure a briefing from cabinet officials.
âMy main question was, âDo we have any feasibility studies of these projects and a cost-benefit analysis?â Their answers were all evasive,â recalled Mr. Wathra, who has since retired.
Ahsan Iqbal, a cabinet minister and the main architect for CPEC in the previous government, said the project was well thought-through and dismissed Mr. Wathraâs account.
âNo one wanted to invest here â the Chinese took a chance,â Mr. Iqbal said in an interview.
But the bill is coming due. Pakistanâs first debt repayments to China are set for next year, starting at about $300 million and gradually increasing to reach about $3.2 billion by 2026, according to officials. And Pakistan is already having trouble paying what it owes to Chinese companies.
Fighter Jets and Satellites
According to the undisclosed proposal drawn up by the Pakistani Air Force and Chinese officials at the start of the year, a special economic zone under CPEC would be created in Pakistan to produce a new generation of fighter jets. For the first time, navigation systems, radar systems and onboard weapons would be built jointly by the countries at factories in Pakistan.
The proposal, confirmed by officials at the Ministry of Planning and Development, would expand China and Pakistanâs current cooperation on the JF-17 fighter jet, which is assembled at Pakistanâs military-run Kamra Aeronautical Complex in Punjab Province. The Chinese-designed jets have given Pakistan an alternative to the American-built F-16 fighters that have become more difficult to obtain as Islamabadâs relationship with Washington frays.
The plans are in the final stages of approval, but the current government is expected to rubber stamp the project, officials in Islamabad say.
For China, Pakistan could become a showcase for other countries seeking to shift their militaries away from American equipment and toward Chinese arms, Western diplomats said. And because China is not averse to selling such advanced weaponry as ballistic missiles â which the United States will not sell to allies like Saudi Arabia â the deal with Pakistan could be a steppingstone to a bigger market for Chinese weapons in the Muslim world.
For years, some of the most important military coordination between China and Pakistan has been going on in space.
Just months before Beijing unveiled the Belt and Road project in 2013, it signed an agreement with Pakistan to build a network of satellite stations inside the South Asian country to establish the Beidou Navigation System as an alternative to the American GPS network.
Beidou quickly became a core component of Belt and Road, with the Chinese government calling the satellite network part of an âinformation Silk Roadâ in a 2015 white paper.
Like GPS, Beidou has a civilian function and a military one. If its trial with Pakistan goes well, Beijing could offer Beidouâs military service to other countries, creating a bloc of nations whose military actions would be more difficult for the United States to monitor.
By 2020, all 35 satellites for the system will be launched in collaboration with other Belt and Road countries, completing Beidou.
âBeidou, whatever any users use it for â whether itâs a civilian navigating their way to the grocery store or a government using it to coordinate their rocket launches â those are all things that China can track,â said Ms. Moriuchi, of the research group Recorded Future. âAnd thatâs what is most striking: that this authoritarian government will be a major technology provider for numerous countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.â
For the Pentagon, Chinaâs satellite launches are ominous.
Chinaâs military âcontinues to strengthen its military space capabilities despite its public stance against the militarization of space,â including developing Beidou and new weaponry, according to a Pentagon report issued to Congress in May.
In October, Pakistanâs information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, said that by 2022, Pakistan would send its own astronaut into space with Chinaâs help.
âWe are close to China, and we are getting more close,â he said in a later interview. âItâs time for the West to wake up and recognize our importance.â
Wooing Pakistanâs Military
Though the relationship between China and Pakistan has clearly grown closer, it has not been without tension. CPEC could still be vulnerable to political shifts in Pakistan â as happened this year in Malaysia, which shelved three big projects by Chinese companies.
Campaigning during the parliamentary elections that made him prime minister in July, Imran Khan vowed to review CPEC projects and renegotiate them if he won. In September, after meeting in Saudi Arabia with the crown prince, Mr. Khan said that the kingdom had agreed to invest in CPEC too.
Pakistanâs new commerce minister then proposed pausing all CPEC projects while the government assessed them.
The moves by Pakistanâs new government angered Beijing, which was concerned they could set back Belt and Road globally.
But in Pakistan, China has a steady ally it can approach to smooth things over: the countryâs powerful military establishment, which stands to fill its coffers with millions of dollars through CPEC as the militaryâs construction companies win infrastructure bids.
Shortly after the commerce ministerâs comments, the Pakistani Armyâs top commander, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, hurried to Beijing for an unannounced visit with President Xi Jinping. The meeting came six weeks before Mr. Khan made his first official visit with the Chinese president, a trip he had listed as a priority.
Statements from the military said General Bajwa and Mr. Xi spoke extensively about Belt and Road projects.
General Bajwa âsaid that the Belt and Road initiative with CPEC as its flagship is destined to succeed despite all odds, and Pakistanâs army shall ensure security of CPEC at all costs,â read a statement from the Pakistani military.
Shortly after the Beijing meeting, Pakistanâs government rolled back its invitation to Saudi Arabia to join CPEC and all talk of pausing or canceling Chinese projects has stopped.
But China could face another challenge to its investments: a Pakistani financial crisis that has forced Mr. Khanâs government to seek loans from international lenders that require transparency.
Throughout September, international delegations traveled to Islamabad carrying the same message: Reveal the extent of Chinese loans if you want financial assistance.
In a late September meeting with visiting officials from the International Monetary Fund, Pakistanâs government asked for a bailout of up to $12 billion. The fundâs representatives pressed Pakistan to share all existing agreements with the Chinese government and demanded I.M.F. input during any future CPEC negotiations â a previously undisclosed facet of the negotiations, according to communications seen by the Fund and a Pakistani official. The fund also sought assurances that Pakistan would not use a bailout to repay CPEC loans.
But the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad stepped up its engagement as well, demanding that CPEC deals be kept secret and promising to shore up Pakistanâs finances with bilateral loans, Pakistani officials say.
Three months after taking office, Mr. Khan still has not made good on his campaign promises to reveal the nature of the $62 billion investment Beijing has committed to Pakistan, and his government has backtracked on an I.M.F. deal.
In early November, Mr. Khan visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, a trip during which he was expected to clinch bilateral loans and grants to ease Pakistanâs financial crisis.
Instead, his government walked away with vague promises of a deal âin principle,â but refused to disclose any details.

China Offers Trump a Trade Peace Deal. It May Not Be Enough.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2246241613?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â China is buying American soybeans again and has cut tariffs on American cars. It is offering to keep its hands off valuable corporate secrets, while also allowing foreign investors into more industries than ever before.
Beijing hopes all of that will be enough to let President Trump declare victory and end the trade war between the two largest economies. But the offer combines some real concessions, like lower tariffs, with nebulous promises, and it will be hard to ensure that China sticks to its commitments.
That could make it a tough sell in Washington. The Trump administrationâs trade hawks are still pushing for a lot more, while even the doves fret that the new promises need effective enforcement to make sure that China follows through, according to people with a detailed knowledge of American policymaking.
Many American officials and businesses complain that China has long wiggled out of commitments â accusations that China denies. And the more hawkish wing of the administration contends that Beijingâs assurances have been so vague that it is hard to discern any meaningful progress, a position some analysts support.
Beijingâs effort so far adds up âto a modest adjustment of Chinese foreign economic policy,â said Scott Kennedy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, âbut nowhere close to the great leap in liberalization that the U.S. and others are seeking.â
Midlevel trade talks this week in Beijing, which will continue into Wednesday, have been productive. But if negotiators do not come to a deal in the coming weeks, the administration is poised to raise American tariffs on $200 billion a year in Chinese-made goods on March 2, amping up the trade war at a time when China faces rapidly softening growth and the American economy is facing headwinds.
It is not clear whether the moves will fully satisfy Mr. Trump. The American stock market, one of the presidentâs favorite barometers, has slumped in part over trade tensions. And further market gyrations could prompt the president to declare victory, even if China does not give up too much.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said in a message on Twitter that the talks were âgoing very well,â a sign that Beijing was at least moving in what he considered the right direction.
China added a complicated new variable to the trade talks on Tuesday by inviting North Koreaâs leader, Kim Jong-un, to Beijing. The invitation could increase pressure on Mr. Trump to reach a deal soon, but it might also antagonize national security hawks in his administration who worry about North Koreaâs ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.
The White House has said China is an unfair trading partner. Its tariffs are too high, it says. It forces American companies to give up important technology to Chinese partners as a price for doing business there. It offers subsidies and cheap loans to Chinese companies that hope to compete with American companies in strategic areas like jetliners, semiconductors and electric cars.
Chinese officials dispute those claims. They say higher Chinese tariffs and strict investment limits are justified because China is still a developing country and well behind the United States in many economic respects. Chinaâs manufacturing capabilities, they say, need upgrading for the countryâs continued growth. They have consistently denied that the government allows forced technology transfers, saying some companies willingly share and make big profits in China doing so.
Still, China has begun to budge. Last month, it dropped retaliatory measures on American-made cars and resumed purchases of American soybeans. It has also reduced tariffs on more than 700 categories of goods from around the world.
Beijing has said it is considering a law that would forbid local Chinese officials to demand foreign companies transfer their technology to Chinese businesses through licensing agreements or joint ventures. It has also promised to open up more fully some sectors of the economy, such as vehicle manufacturing and brokerages, to foreign investors. The efforts, Beijing believes, will help the Chinese economy even as they placate Mr. Trump.
On cars and soybeans, American negotiators can claim some measure of victory. Soybean purchases have yet to reach earlier volumes, however, while Chinese imports of American-made cars are quite small since many are already made in China.
But China had imposed measures on soybeans and cars to retaliate against American tariffs last summer on $50 billion of Chinese goods. By dropping them, without requiring the United States to abandon theirs, China is signaling that for now it is willing to accept higher American tariffs on some of its goods, provided they are not applied more broadly.
Chinaâs other peace offerings are more ambiguous.
Chinese lawmakers last month released a draft of a proposed law that would stop local officials from forcing foreign companies to transfer their technology as a cost of doing business. The Trump administration says that Chinese industries like cars and aviation have benefited from American technology.
The law may not change things meaningfully, said Donald Clarke, a specialist in Chinese law at George Washington University. The draft is vaguely worded, he said, and doesnât acknowledge that the pressure American companies face to share their know-how often comes from behind-the-scenes maneuvering rather than strict government requirements.
As with many laws in China, it could also be moot if local governments decide not to enforce it or if penalties are not stiff enough.
âThese forced tech transfers that people complain about donât occur because some government department issues an order saying, âTransfer this tech,ââ Mr. Clarke said in an email.
âItâs done through the government department getting involved behind the scenes in the negotiations, or not granting discretionary permission to do something unless some tech is transferred. Itâs very hard to stop through a specific rule.â
Still, Chinese analysts say the pledges are significant. Chinese laws and regulations are often succinct â only a page or two when American laws or regulations would require dozens or even hundreds of pages. The real work lies in carrying out the regulations, and Beijing is now prepared to impose the new rules diligently, Chinese analysts say.
The issue of forced technology transfer âis a longstanding complaint by American businesses in China, and we are addressing it through legal adjustments,â said Tu Xinquan, the executive dean of the China Institute for World Trade Organization Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. âSo no matter what, there will be a positive impact to some extent, that is, in reducing Americaâs dissatisfaction with China.â
Chinese officials are also taking steps to strengthen intellectual property protections against counterfeiters and piracy. Chinese officials last month submitted a draft amendment to the countryâs patent law that would raise the level of damages and fines for willfully infringing on patents.
One of the biggest beneficiaries might be companies in China. Big Chinese players have increasingly shed their reputation as copycats and have developed sophisticated technologies, and complain that local businesses can too easily steal their ideas.
âTo be honest, in many areas, there is still insufficient motivation for innovation,â said Ma Yu, a research scholar in foreign investment research at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. âSo I donât view these moves to be concessions or compromises, let alone harmful to us.â
The biggest sticking point in Chinaâs package of concessions to the White House may be Made in China 2025, a government plan for developing high-tech industries. The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the plan, saying it is evidence that China unfairly supports its own companies over foreign competitors in the Chinese market.
China has played down the catchy Made in China 2025 name. But thereâs no concrete reason to believe that Chinese companies have halted or reversed their plans, or that officials are any less interested in plowing money into its state-owned enterprises. Chinaâs Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which played a major role in the program, said last month that it would continue to support development of new manufacturing processes, without mentioning the policy by name.
Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, an American business group, said that âitâs positive that China is taking steps proactively.â
But he also said that China had yet to completely fulfill its promises on issues ranging from opening up its market to credit-rating agencies and American banks to accepting credit card companiesâ efforts since 2001 to offer full, nationwide service.
âAre more statements going to be enough to move the needle for President Trump?â Mr. Parker asked. âI think it would have to be a lot more robust than another policy. I donât think this meets that bar.â

American Companies Need Chinese Consumers,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2246241619?accountid=14586,"In a rare bit of bad news for its investors, Apple last week laid the blame for lower than expected revenue on its performance in China. The news sent Appleâs stock price plunging, and investors also ditched other companies with significant exposure in China. The scale of the damage, both to Appleâs bottom line and to the broader market, underscores how critically important China â and Chinese consumers â have become for American companies.
China accounts for about $52 billion in sales for Apple, and is its third-largest market. Apple is not the only technology company that relies on sales in China. For Qualcomm, a chip maker whose technology is used in many Apple smartphones, the figure is $15 billion, or about 65 percent of its total sales, according to an estimate by FactSet. Others with big bets on China include Intel (24 percent of sales), Micron Technology (51 percent), and Texas Instruments (44 percent).
These numbers make it very clear that the perception of China as the âfactory of the world,â flooding global markets with cheap goods, is badly out of date. Exports and capital investments such as buildings and roads are no longer the main engines of Chinaâs growth. Exports have dropped from 36 percent of Chinaâs gross domestic product in 2006 to 20 percent in 2018. Going after Chinaâs exports with tariffs, as the Trump administration is attempting, is, to a certain extent, fighting yesterdayâs war.
In recent years, Chinaâs economy has shifted to one that is much more dependent on domestic household consumption â ordinary Chinese people buying things for themselves and their families. In China over the last decade, the growth in private consumption has outpaced overall economic growth rate. In 2018, G.D.P. in China grew by 6.5 percent, and household consumption accounted for about four-fifths of that growth.
China is now the fastest-growing consumer market in the world, with private consumption amounting to about $5 trillion, more than 10 percent of the worldâs total. Competition for Chinese consumersâ hard-earned renminbi has become intense.
Consider the smartphone market. As recently as 2016, Apple was Chinaâs leading maker of handsets. But by the third quarter of 2018, Chinaâs dominant telecommunications company, Huawei, was on top, with 23 percent of the market. The Chinese smartphone makers Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi occupy the next three spots, while Apple ranked fifth, with 9 percent. South Koreaâs Samsung, the global leader in smartphone sales, has all but disappeared from China, having failed to recover from the fiasco over its dangerously overheating Galaxy Note 7 batteries.
Even industries where American consumers once reigned supreme are now increasingly shifting toward China. General Motors, for example, sells more cars in China than in North America. For global filmmakers, box office sales in 2018 totaled about $9 billion in China, compared with almost $12 billion for North America in 2018.
My company made a decision more than a decade ago not to invest in Chinaâs export sector. Costs for Chinese manufacturers are rising, and prices for their exports are flat or falling. Instead, I feel strongly that there is much greater potential for companies â inside and outside China â that cater to the Chinese consumer market.
Yes, Chinaâs economic growth has begun to slow, and there has been a decrease in investments as Beijing has moved to tighten credit. And the threat of a trade war with the United States is real. But my long-term outlook has not changed. The Chinese consumer market will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace, and it will continue to be a market that any global company must pay serious attention to if it wants to remain competitive.
So where does this leave companies like Apple that find themselves caught in the middle of the trade war? They must hope, first of all, for a swift conclusion to the latest round of trade negotiations between China and the United States, which began in Beijing on Monday. The best possible outcome is a deal that will encourage China to open its economy further, commit to shrinking its bloated state-owned sector and ease barriers to further foreign investment and trade.
Tariffs were supposed to hurt China by hitting its exports to the United States. That hasnât happened. Should it persist, the trade war will, of course, hurt Chinese companies, just as it has already hurt so many American companies. But if the conflict eventually drags down Chinese consumer demand, businesses all over the world will be the losers.

Chinaâs Slowdown Looms Just as the World Looks for Growth,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2246227650?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â In the vast metropolis of Chongqing in western China, three huge Ford Motor assembly plants have slowed to a fraction of their earlier pace.
In the eastern province of Jiangsu, hundreds of chemical factories have closed.
In Guangdong Province in the southeast, factories have idled workers in droves.
Chinaâs huge economy, a major driver of global growth, is cooling just when the world needs its spark. On Monday, Chinese officials said that, during the last three months of 2018, the economy grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis.
It is happening at a difficult time. The broader world outlook is beginning to dim. The American economy, which has powered ahead in recent years with strong growth and low unemployment, is showing some signs of a slowdown and is facing higher short-term interest rates that could act as a brake. Europeâs resurgence is beginning to show its age, too, with even Germanyâs industrial engine starting to sputter.
In the past, China has helped the world out of such weak spots, most notably during the global financial crisis. But this time, its economy is showing pronounced weakness.
Car sales have plunged in China since last summer. Smartphone sales are falling. The real estate market has stagnated, with deeply indebted developers forced to pay steep interest rates to roll over their debts. And trade frictions with the West, coupled with tough policies from Beijing toward foreign investors, have made Chinese and foreign companies alike warier of further investment in China.
âEuropean investment in China is going down,â Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m, the European Unionâs commissioner of trade, said during an interview in Washington. âThat is more because it is becoming increasingly complicated to do business there, with the forced technology transfer, with the lack of transparency, discrimination as compared to Chinese companies, with the massive subsidies of state-owned companies.â
For the heads of state and corporate leaders gathering this week in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, the Chinese economy could be the most pressing issue, even among the trade fights and political uncertainty plaguing the rest of the world.
China on Monday said its economy grew 6.4 percent during the last three months of 2018 compared with the same time in 2017. For all of 2018, Chinaâs economy grew 6.6 percent, the slowest pace since 1990, though many economists believe the countryâs headline figures are unreliable.
Previous slowdowns in China, like the one in 2015 and 2016, unnerved investors and global business leaders alike, setting off worries that multinational companies would lose profits from their Chinese subsidiaries, or that Chinese companies would dump their surplus production on world markets at very low prices.
Apple surprised markets this month when it warned of weaker-than-expected demand for its iPhones in China. Ford Motor cut output at its Chongqing joint venture by 70 percent in November, in what Ford says was a move to reduce inventories of unsold cars. Chemical industry experts said that mostly Chinese-owned chemical factories in Jiangsu had been shutting down because of weak demand and stricter environmental enforcement.
The question now is to what extent nervous business leaders elsewhere will postpone investment as China slows, and how many investors will dump their shareholdings.
âThe global economy and financial markets are incredibly sensitive to Chinaâs growth and currency outlook,â said Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Washington-based Institute of International Finance. âThe immediate financial linkages are relatively modest, but they are swamped by sentiment channels.â
To be sure, further slowing in China is not the only risk the global economy faces. A disorderly British exit from the European Union or a financial crisis in debt-ridden Italy could also be unsettling. In the United States, the national debt is rising and the stimulus from large tax cuts may start to wear off by next year. The Federal Reserve could keep raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay, making it more expensive to borrow money, though it isnât clear exactly what the American central bank will do.
Still, the big question now is, to paraphrase the line about Las Vegas: Will what happens in China stay in China, or will it become a global problem?
The World Bank aptly titled its review of this yearâs outlook âDarkening Prospects.â It warned that Chinaâs slowdown could affect countries that export a great deal to it.
China is the worldâs second-largest importer, after the United States. But the composition of its imports is unusual.
It is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters, from Australia to Uruguay, thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore, food, energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming. China is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like Germany and Japan.
But its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size. That has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere, particularly in the United States, on the Chinese economy.
The global impact of the Chinese slowdown now underway could be limited if Beijing decides to borrow and spend its way into more growth. Already this month, China has issued a series of announcements approving six municipal subway construction projects and three new intercity rail lines, at a combined cost of $148 billion.
âThe weaker the data gets, the more confident we get that theyâll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving,â said Michael Blythe, the chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.
Many of the biggest new construction projects are in Chinaâs western regions, said Wang Min, the chairman of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant. The projects have been good for his company, Chinaâs largest producer of huge earth-moving equipment, and its orders have soared in recent months.
But linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive. It adds large sums to Chinaâs already very high levels of debt. And the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt.
Previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one-two punch that has laid Chinaâs overall economy low in recent months.
Vice Premier Liu He promised at Davos a year ago that China would rein in the growth of credit within three years. Chinese officials were confident at the time that they could head off a trade war with the United States.
They set about putting stringent limits on the countryâs extensive shadow banking networks. Those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the countryâs small and midsize enterprises, which Chinaâs big, state-owned banks have long neglected in favor of lending to state-owned enterprises.
But by the end of April, as the economy started slowing, Chinese officials started to say that three years was not enough time. As credit dried up and many private sector businesses started running low on cash, top regulators expressed worry at a Shanghai financial conference in June that they might have already gone too far.
At the same time, momentum was building in Beijing to extend the influence of the Communist Party and state-owned enterprises, mainly at the expense of the private sector. The private sector is responsible for most job creation in China, and the rhetoric from Beijing further scared investors.
Less than a month after the Shanghai conference, the trade war began in earnest. President Trump imposed the first of three tranches of tariffs on imports from China. Corporate executives say that by the time the third tranche hit in late September, consumer confidence was crumbling. Purchases of big-ticket goods, especially cars, fell fast.
Business confidence slumped as well. A survey of 270 importers in the United States conducted in late December and early January by Panjiva, a trade data service, found that 71 percent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged. And 87 percent said they would do so if the Trump administration raised tariffs further.
As companies start moving their supply chains, the main beneficiaries seem to be Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Indonesia. But to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like Germany, some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in China could be offset.
Most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in China. Many are predicting that the second will be, too.
But quite a few say they still have confidence in Chinaâs consistent, four-decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly. Chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence. And they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favor state-owned enterprises over them.
âAs long as we can create a level playing field,â said Ma Jiantang, a senior economic adviser to Chinaâs cabinet, âprivate companies will surely succeed.â

Pessimism Looms Over Prospect of a Sweeping China Trade Deal,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2246225317?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â As a critical round of talks with China kicks off next week, the Trump administration is increasingly pessimistic that Beijing will make the kind of deep structural changes to its economy that the United States wants as part of a comprehensive trade agreement, according to officials involved with the talks.
The United States is now weighing whether large Chinese purchases of American goods and more modest economic changes will be enough for a deal to end a damaging trade war between the two nations and help calm volatile markets.
A Chinese delegation led by Liu He, Chinaâs vice premier, will meet with Robert Lighthizer, the Trump administrationâs top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, on Jan. 30 and 31. The two countries are racing to strike an agreement by March 2, a deadline set by President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.
If no deal is reached by that date, Mr. Trump has said the United States will raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Mr. Trump has focused on narrowing the trade gap between what the United States imports from China and what it exports, but the administration is also pressuring Beijing to scale back subsidies of state-owned enterprises, drastically open its markets to foreign investment and end its longstanding practice of forcing American companies to hand over trade secrets.
For years, American companies, including technology firms and automakers, have been clamoring for such changes as they try to gain access to Chinaâs growing market. But many are beginning to fear that if the continuing brinkmanship between the worldâs two largest economies is not resolved, American companies will be left in an even worse position.
âI would have a hard time, especially considering whatâs happening in Washington, believing that this will be wrapped up in a little bow by March,â said Charles Freeman, senior vice president for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Markets have been particularly sensitive to the state of the talks, with stocks gyrating as whispers of progress or setbacks trickle out.
Stock prices in the United States spiked last week after a Wall Street Journal report suggested that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended the removal of some tariffs to hasten a deal. They jumped again after Bloomberg News reported that China had offered to buy $1 trillion of American goods over the next six years.
Over the weekend, Mr. Trump expressed hope that a deal could be reached but dismissed suggestions that the United States would roll back tariffs in advance of concessions from China.
âWe have taken in tremendous amounts of money in the United States because of the sanctions,â Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday, apparently confusing sanctions and tariffs. âIf we make a deal, certainly we wouldnât have sanctions.â
In a tweet on Monday evening, Mr. Trump once again suggested that the United States had the upper hand in negotiations, saying Chinaâs slowing economy should hasten a trade deal.
âChina posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies,â the president said. âMakes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!â
Despite Mr. Trumpâs optimism about reaching a deal, others in the administration and on Capitol Hill have been more circumspect.
âThis is an ongoing process with the Chinese that is nowhere near completion,â a Treasury spokesman said, rebutting the suggestion that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended rolling back tariffs.
Last week, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Mr. Lighthizer, who is leading the talks, had told him there had been no progress on the âstructuralâ changes that the administration sought from China.
Mr. Lighthizer, a longtime China hawk, has been pushing to ensure that China fulfills promises that Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump during a meeting in Buenos Aires last year. Mr. Lighthizer has expressed concern to colleagues and business groups that Mr. Trump could accept a watered-down deal that reduces the trade deficit but offers only symbolic structural changes to help end the trade war and lift the stock market.
In an interview on the Fox Business Network on Friday, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said he was hopeful that a deal would be reached but acknowledged that many details still needed to be determined.
âThe technology stuff has not been dealt with, the enforcement stuff has not been dealt with,â Mr. Kudlow said. âThe commodity stuff and the tariff rates, weâre moving on the right track.â
To those who see the negotiations as the best opportunity to rebalance the trade relationship between Washington and Beijing, the prospect of rolling back tariffs without sweeping concessions by China would fail to achieve Mr. Trumpâs goal of ending what he has deemed its unfair trade practices.
âHe wants to brag about what he got, not stop tariffs and be able to brag about nothing,â said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
A slimmed-down deal could also open Mr. Trump up to criticism from Democrats, who in some cases are more aligned with the presidentâs aggressive approach to pressuring China than many Republicans.
âAnything less than a full effort to secure a fundamental reset of the U.S.-China trade relationship is a betrayal of the American economy and the future of American workers, industry, consumers and innovators,â said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. âThe Trump administration needs to stiffen its spine and get tough in these China talks.â
Trump administration officials have been debating whether they can push more tariffs on China without facing significant repercussions. Chinaâs economy is already slowing, in part because of the tariffs, and any further weakening could hurt global economic growth and the United States economy, which is itself showing signs of cooling.
Mr. Mnuchin has been particularly interested in how big a role Americaâs trade actions are playing in Chinaâs recent economic weakness.
Trump administration officials have debated whether they should follow through with plans to raise tariffs to 25 percent, from 10 percent, on March 2 if China does not maintain the promises Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump, like accelerating purchases of American goods and making structural changes to its economy.
Progress over the next six weeks could result in an extension of the March 2 deadline, even if a final deal is not reached, or some tariff relief as a reward for initial changes that China says it is willing to make. But the decision will ultimately rest with Mr. Trump.
One question bedeviling the talks is how to enforce any trade agreement with China, given its opaque business environment and largely managed economy. One option that administration officials have considered is âsnapbackâ tariffs, which would be reimposed if China appears to be reneging on its commitments.
Mr. Trump has pointed to Chinaâs economic weakness as a reason it should acquiesce to his countryâs trade demands. But the trade war is also taking a toll on the United States economy, and the monthlong shutdown could lead to an economic contraction if it continues to drag on.
While business are hoping for greater access to Chinaâs markets, the strategy of using tariffs as a negotiating tool has dented business confidence. According to a survey of 277 American companies by S&P Global this month, 43 percent said they had postponed investment because of the China tariffs.
Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the administration, said that there were several important unknowns about the trade discussions that suggested a comprehensive deal was not near.
It remains unclear if there is a working text of a deal that the two countries are using to hash out an agreement. And it is unclear whether China will pressure the Trump administration to drop its efforts to extradite the chief financial officer of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company. The executive was arrested in Canada last year as part of a broader agreement. The complicated internal debates taking place within Chinaâs government also make it difficult to predict its willingness to make concessions.
âWe are a long way to a deal,â Mr. Pillsbury said. âMuch work remains to be done, especially untangling the debate in China and pressure on Xi Jinping.â
But Mr. Trump is also under pressure and the window for him to use market-rattling tariffs as leverage is likely to shrink as his re-election campaign heats up next year.
âThe damage to U.S. business, consumers and exporters is real and ongoing,â Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and scholar at the Cato Institute, said, noting that the risks of this approach only increased if negotiations with China dragged into 2020. âIf youâre the Chinese, delay is your best friend.â

What Soybean Politics Tell Us About Argentina and China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.l ib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2246222049?accountid=14586,"It should have been easy, traveling through Argentina, to find a bottle of soy sauce. My sons, born and raised in Asia, have a habit of seasoning their food with a few drops of it, and Argentina happens to be one of the worldâs leading producers of soybeans. Flying over the countryâs heartland â the fertile expanse known as the pampa hÃºmeda â we could see endless fields of the legume. Over the past three decades, soybeans have gone from being a tiny part of Argentinaâs agriculture-dependent economy to occupying nearly 50 percent of its cultivated land. Yet in every restaurant we visited, my sonsâ requests for soy sauce were met with a quizzical look and a shrug: No hay. (âThere is none.â)
The vast majority of Argentinaâs soy products are exported, mostly to China. Rising Asian demand â for soy sauce, tofu, animal feed â has fueled the explosion of the soybean industry across Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The pattern is a familiar one for Argentina. A century ago, it became one of the worldâs wealthiest countries on a per-capita basis by shipping the pampaâs abundant yields of grain and beef to Europe. The opulent 1929 Beaux-Arts building that houses the Board of Trade in Rosario, Argentinaâs agricultural capital, evokes those days of grandeur. Today, however, it is the price of soybean futures that dominates the electronic tickers on the wall. Last year, Argentina exported $17 billion in soybean products, more than a quarter of its overall export earnings. Half the ships leaving the country are now full of soy goods â beans, meal, oil, etc. â and heading to Asia. âThe old saying in Argentina is still true: âWith a good harvest, we are saved,â â says Patricia Bergero, the boardâs deputy director for economic research. âOur economy is very dependent on soybeans and China â perhaps too dependent.â
The beans, however, are just the beginning. Over the past decade, China has more than doubled its overall trade with Latin America and the Caribbean, to $244 billion in 2017, elevating China past the United States as the regionâs top trading partner, a stunning development in Americaâs own backyard. Early on, China focused on gobbling up the resources it needed to feed its voracious economy: oil from Venezuela and Ecuador, copper and iron from Peru and Chile, soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. In the past few years, though, Chinese engagement has spread and deepened, especially with left-leaning governments that are in financial trouble and looking for an alternative to American influence. In Argentina, the president, Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, turned to China in 2014 after her government defaulted on $100 billion of international debt. In addition to offering $11 billion in currency swaps to increase Argentinaâs depleted reserves, China began rebuilding a rail line across Argentinaâs agricultural heart, constructing two hydroelectric dams and erecting a space station in the arid plateau of northern Patagonia.
When the conservative businessman Mauricio Macri succeeded Kirchner in December 2015, he seemed eager to do something few other leaders have dared: to push China away. Macri immediately suspended construction of the two dams in southern Patagonia, citing the lack of transparency and environmental impact surveys. Three months later, the Argentine Coast Guard sank a Chinese fishing boat that refused to leave the countryâs territorial waters. The resistance didnât last long. Not only did China quickly reduce its soybean imports by 30 percent in the first seven months of Macriâs government, but Chinese officials also reminded Macri that its investments in Argentina were linked. The dam contracts even had default clauses stipulating that the suspension of work would trigger the suspension of Chinaâs railroad project, too. It was all or nothing. Did Macri want to end up with nothing?
Two other factors intensified the pressure: Argentinaâs worsening monetary crisis and the election of Donald Trump. âWhen Macri took office, his government hoped to sign a trade agreement with the United States,â one Argentine government adviser told me. âOnce Trump won, all hopes were banished. The calculus changed.â Americaâs trade protectionism diminished Argentinaâs chances of having what people there call âcarnal relationsâ with Washington. By early 2017, Macri traveled to China on a state visit. Resistance had turned into acquiescence. âHis positions changed quickly,â says MarÃ­a JosÃ© Haro Sly, an Argentine sociologist who has studied China-Latin American agricultural relations. âItâs funny, but Macri has now signed more deals with China than the two previous governments combined.â
The shift in attitudes was evident at the G-20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires late last year. Trump and Macri had a cordial one-on-one meeting; American support had been crucial for Argentina to obtain a $56 billion loan package last year from the International Monetary Fund. But when Trumpâs press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the two leaders had discussed âpredatory Chinese economic activity,â Macri felt compelled to object. âThat comment ... was not representative of Argentinaâs view,â one of his deputies told The South China Morning Post. âWe value our relationship with China very much and have a very important commercial relationship with China.â Pleasing two superpowers is complicated. âAt first, Macri tried to distance himself from China,â says AndrÃ©s LÃ³pez, the head of the economics department at the University of Buenos Aires. âBut after seeing how hard that is, heâs trying to find equilibrium between China and the United States.â
When Macri met with Chinaâs president, Xi Jinping, a couple of days later, they celebrated Chinaâs role as Argentinaâs most critical trading partner, investor and financier, the basis of their newly christened âcomprehensive strategic alliance.â (Itâs not as intimate as âcarnal relations,â but a step up from the marriage of convenience that prevailed before.) In December, Xi and Macri signed more than 30 new agriculture and investment deals, including another $8.6 billion currency swap that makes China the biggest noninstitutional lender in Argentina. The swap functions as a no-interest loan that helps keep the government afloat and tamp down Argentinaâs almost 50 percent inflation rate. The atmospherics of the meeting were even more telling. When the Argentine polo association presented Xi with a horse, the Chinese leader smiled delightedly as Macri fitted him with a red polo helmet emblazoned with the five yellow stars of Chinaâs flag.
Macri isnât looking his gift horse in the mouth, either. Despite his tough initial stance, Macriâs financially hobbled government is now embracing Chinese investments in oil, infrastructure and mining. Beijing is moving quickly to control the lithium fields in northern Argentina and Chile, which in 2017 accounted for almost half of global production of the element, which is used in batteries. In January, Macri traveled to southern Patagonia to reinaugurate the construction of the two Chinese-funded hydroelectric dams that he suspended three years ago. It was a humbling turnaround, but he was spared greater embarrassment when the larger dam â once named for NÃ©stor Kirchner, the former president and husband of Macriâs rival, Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner â was rechristened Condor Cliff.
In the city of Ushuaia, on the icy spine of Tierra del Fuego, a restaurant named Bamboo has a sign, in Chinese, that advertises the place as âthe southernmost Chinese restaurant in the world.â Ever since Beijing approved Antarctica as a tourist destination about a decade ago, the number of Chinese visitors making the journey has jumped from zero to more than 8,000 a year (making up about 16 percent of all tourists to Antarctica in 2018). Almost all of them go through Ushuaia, where they crowd around Bambooâs seafood buffet, which promises flavors that taste almost like home.
The rise in Chinese tourism to Antarctica is driven not just by exotic travel plans but also by strategic government priorities. Despite its geographical location far from the poles, China promotes itself as a polar power, maneuvering for influence over both the Arctic and Antarctic. Last year ground was broken on Chinaâs fifth research station on Antarctica. Beijing emphasizes its desire to help govern the fragile continent, but analysts say a central objective is to gain access to Antarcticaâs oil and mineral deposits â and to establish bases that will help China develop superior GPS technology, giving it an edge in the space-based arms race. (The Chinese space station in Argentinaâs remote NeuquÃ©n province is also meant to advance Chinaâs space-and-satellite technology.)
For all its geostrategic interests, Chinaâs relationship with Latin America is still driven by basic commodities, and soybeans have become a symbol of superpower competition. As a result of the trade war and the retaliatory tariffs China placed on American soybean products, China did not import a single soybean from the United States in November. Brazil and Argentina have leapt into the gap. Despite a drought that reduced harvests by 40 percent last year, Argentina still exported seven million tons of soybeans to China. (To feed its crushing facilities, Argentina also became, weirdly, the largest importer of American soybeans in 2018, buying $1.3 billion of beans from desperate United States farmers.) This year, after abundant rainfall, Argentina expects to export 14 million tons of soybeans, double the level from two years ago â almost all of them will go to China.
When my family reached Buenos Aires, we realized that there were lots of Chinese-run grocery stores that sold soy sauce to the growing Chinese immigrant community. On the road, however, our predicament wasnât resolved until we stayed at a small Korean-run hotel in the remote southern Patagonian town of El Calafate. When the Korean ownerâs daughter heard about our sonsâ hankering for soy sauce, she made sure to slip us a tiny glass bottle in a double plastic bag before our trip to the glaciers. We carried that bottle with us for the rest of our journey, pulling it out surreptitiously to put on our rice and eggs. It was only near the end that I realized that the soy sauce was, of course, made in China.

Can China Turn the Middle of Nowhere Into the Center of the World Economy?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245659282?accountid=14586,"The Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility is a striking name for an absence. It is the point farthest from a sea or ocean on the planet. Located in China just east of the border with Kazakhstan, the pole gets you a good distance from harbors and coastlines â at least 1,550 miles in any direction â into an expanse of white steppe and blue-beige mountain that is among the least populated places on earth. Here, among some of the last surviving pastoral nomads in Central Asia, nestled between two branches of the Tian Shan range on the edge of Kazakhstan, the largest infrastructure project in the history of the world is growing.
About 80 miles from the Pole of Inaccessibility, just across the border in Kazakhstan, is a village called Khorgos. It has spent most of its existence on the obscure periphery of international affairs, and its official population is just 908. But over the last few years, it has become an important node of the global economy. It is part of an initiative known informally as the new Silk Road, a China-led effort to build a vast cephalopodic network of highways, railroads and overseas shipping routes, supported by hundreds of new plants, pipelines and company towns in dozens of countries. Ultimately, the Belt and Road Initiative, or B.R.I., as the project is more formally known, will link Chinaâs coastal factories and rising consumer class with Central, Southeast and South Asia; with the Gulf States and the Middle East; with Africa; and with Russia and all of Europe, all by way of a lattice of land and sea routes whose collective ambition boggles the mind.
Khorgos is a flagship project of this work in progress, an international shipping hub and free-trade zone that its promoters say is poised to become the next Dubai. Thanks to its location at the junction of the worldâs soon-to-be-largest national economy and its largest landlocked country, Khorgos has become an unlikely harbinger of the interconnected planet: a zone fully enclosed by the logic of globalization, where goods flow freely across sovereign borders, following corridors designed to locate every human being on the planet within a totalizing network of producers and consumers, buyers and sellers.
[Read about Chinaâs $1 trillion plan to shake up the economic order.]
Such victories of the global and industrial over the local, isolated and rural are heralded as the inevitable future â if there is to be a future â of our species. What would that future look like? Whom would it benefit? What would it cost? To find out, last July I caught a sleeper train from Almaty, Kazakhstanâs largest city, to the Chinese border, where I woke up in a train yard surrounded by desert.
Khorgos is one of a cluster of villages encircling a former trading post of the ancient world called Zharkent. From Zharkent, I hoped to arrange a ride to the border. Frescoes of camel caravans flanked the entrance gate on Silk Road Avenue. In a central square stood a rainbow-colored mosque with the sweeping eaves of a Chinese pagoda and an inscription in Uighur enjoining visitors not to forget their past. Next to the mosque was the warren of chopped-up shipping containers that serves as Zharkentâs central market. Taxi drivers hung unhopefully around the watermelon stands.
Among the drivers was a farmer named Nunur, who had come to Kazakhstan from China in 1962, when he was a young boy and Kazakhstan was a Soviet Socialist Republic. That year, more than 60,000 Chinese Uighurs and Kazakhs escaped to the Soviet Union, crossing with Soviet passports they received from the consulate in Xinjiang and with the apparent cooperation of Chinese border guards. Nunur remembered his parents walking him over red hills at night toward the checkpoint at Khorgos. âThey opened the border and let us go into Soviet territory,â he recalled. There were rumors that his relatives who stayed behind were imprisoned or killed. (Nunur, fearing trouble from the authorities, asked that I use only his first name.) His parents, who had raised wheat in China, found work on a collective farm. His mother became a cook while his father learned to drive tractors and Nunur to repair them. He became an expert mechanic. âIâm a master without a diploma,â he said.
I asked Nunur to drive me to a place near the border where we could take in the booming hub of Khorgos at a glance. On the way, we passed his cornfields, apportioned to him after the breakup of the collective farm. Even as Kazakhstan modernized following its 1991 independence, growing rich by regional standards from the sale of oil and outfitting a new capital city with glossy architectural marvels, the eastern border with China remained sparsely developed, its economy dominated by livestock and grain production. Nunur said his village still had no indoor plumbing, and as we left his fields we passed some of the ruins of centralized planning the Soviets left behind: a former winery, a shuttered milk plant.
Chinaâs plans are significantly more ambitious, and they reach far beyond eastern Kazakhstan. The âbeltâ of the B.R.I. refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt, a tangle of rail and highway routes currently vining their way untidily across the continent from eastern China to Scandinavia. The âroadâ is the Maritime Silk Road, a shipping lane that will connect Quanzhou to Venice, with prospective stops along the way in Malaysia, Ethiopia and Egypt. To date, at least 68 countries, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the planetâs total population, have signed on to bilateral projects partly funded by Chinaâs policy banks and other state-owned enterprises. Chinese firms are building or investing in new highways and coal-fired power plants in Pakistan, ports in Greece and Sri Lanka, gas and oil pipelines in Central Asia, an industrial city in Oman and a $6 billion railway project in Laos, which in 2017 had a G.D.P. of less than $17 billion. Chinaâs port holdings stretch from Myanmar to Israel and from Mauritius to Belgium. It has spent an estimated $200 billion on B.R.I. projects so far, mostly in Asia, and has implied it will spend a total of $1 trillion on hundreds of projects around the world in the coming years, dwarfing the Marshall Plan by roughly an order of magnitude. When the investments from all the participating countries are combined, the estimated cost rises to $8 trillion.
The B.R.I. is so big and multifarious that describing it can feel like trying to narrate the weather conditions of the entire planet. Some individual components span hundreds of miles and are themselves dauntingly complex and international, like the $68 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or the stalled and scandal-mired Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor. Taken as a whole, the B.R.I. is unfathomable. But I had heard that, at Khorgos, a pioneering outpost, I could get closer than anywhere else to appreciating the scope of its aspirations.
Nunur drove me through his village to an overlook within view of a border sentry post, a few miles from the spot where he crossed into Kazakhstan almost six decades before. We parked near a small rock-crushing plant above a valley of bright green cornfields. Beyond the fields, through a blue haze, I could see this improbable new crossroads of the global economy.
The Chinese side of the border was easiest to spot. Since 2014, an instant city of 100,000 people, also called Khorgos (sometimes spelled Horgos), has appeared; its dark high-rises glittered in the sun. The Kazakh side of the border was less impressive from afar, but I knew it now hosted a first-of-its-kind free-trade zone, opened on territory shared with China. Behind a copse of cypress trees, I could also make out the gantry cranes of the new dry port â an inland shipping-and-logistics hub for freight trains â that began operating in 2015 and could soon be the largest port of its kind in the world. Adjacent to the dry port was a nascent railroad company town, and other plots nearby were cleared for factories and warehouses to be staffed by some of the future residents of the city of 100,000 that, if all goes as planned, will soon rise to match the one across the border.
[ The Timesâs special report on how China became a superpower.]
The manager of the plant wandered over. He asked whether we wanted to get through the checkpoint, beyond which was the last village in Kazakhstan and, beyond that, China.
We got back in the car and pulled up to two guards who stood at the gate, rifles slung over their shoulders. They looked young and bored. The manager shouted the name of one of them, who walked shyly up to the passenger-side window. It seemed as if everyone in town knew everyone else.
âGive me some sunflower seeds,â the manager said. The guard pulled a bag from his pocket and poured seeds into the managerâs cupped hand until it overflowed. The manager explained that we wanted to see China. The guard shrugged and raised the boom gate.
Two miles beyond the checkpoint, across a valley of farmland, a tangerine ridge signaled the start of Chinaâs largest territory, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. The border was somewhere in the valley beneath us. If we kept going, we would arrive at the Chinese sentry post we could just make out at the top of a train of switchbacks. We didnât test it, however. In recent years, the Chinese government has erected the most advanced police state in the world in Xinjiang, targeting the regionâs Turkic Muslims, especially its Uighur ethnic group, who make up about half the regionâs population. As part of what Chinese Communist Party literature describes as âde-extremificationâ efforts to combat terrorism, authorities have created an exclusion zone of state surveillance, arbitrary mass internment, brainwashing and torture that covers an area more than four times the size of Germany and includes a population almost as big as Australiaâs. According to the United States State Department, between 800,000 and two million people, or up to 15 percent of Xinjiangâs Muslim population, have been incarcerated in a growing network of more than 1,000 concentration camps.
You couldnât see any of that from our perch at the border. Everything looked peaceful. To our left, a shepherdâs path ascended into white-capped mountains where herdsmen grazed sheep and cattle in summer, far above the fields of corn and sunflowers. To our right, beyond the ridge, the high-modernist future of international commerce was springing up out of the ground. You could squint and imagine you were looking at a time-lapse photo of the entire history of collective human activity, from the first wandering goat-herder all the way to the present.
China has never released any official map of Belt and Road routes nor any list of approved projects, and it provides no exact count of participating nations or even guidelines on what it means to be a participant. But this fuzziness may be one of its defining advantages. Rather than a list of megaprojects and bilateral deals, some of which might stumble or fail, the B.R.I. can be understood as a vaguely visible hand guiding all the interlocking developments in infrastructure, energy and trade where China plays any kind of role.
It is also a framework through which Chinaâs leaders can present virtually any component of its foreign policy, from a soda-ash plant in Turkey to Chinaâs first foreign military base, in Djibouti, as part of a nonthreatening vision of what party representatives like to call âwin winâ global development. In recent years, China has floated several expansions of President Xi Jinpingâs initial Belt and Road vision that make its scope seem all but limitless: the âDigital Silk Roadâ into the frontiers of the virtual, the âPacific Silk Roadâ to South America, and the Arctic-crossing âSilk Road on Ice.â Xi himself has meanwhile extolled the merits of globalization at Davos and worked to brand his âproject of the centuryâ as a natural extension of the spontaneous trade routes that once laced across the Eurasian continent.
Critics have described the B.R.I. as a new kind of colonialism or even part of a strategy of âdebt-trap diplomacy,â seducing cash-poor countries with infrastructure projects that are unlikely to generate enough revenue to cover the interest on the loans that funded them. That is the unhappy situation at the China-funded Port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka, which the China Harbor Engineering Company took over after Sri Lanka fell behind on debt service. The Center for Global Development lists eight countries that face high risk of âdebt distressâ from B.R.I. projects that they canât afford.
[Read about Chinaâs growing influence in Latin America.]
Kazakhstan is poised to play a literally central role in Chinaâs plan. The B.R.I. was first announced in Astana, at a 2013 ceremony attended by Xi and Kazakhstanâs longtime president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev. At the same event, Xi and Nazarbayev also celebrated the opening of a joint gas pipeline and signed $30 billion worth of trade and investment agreements. Although in the past Kazakhstanâs economy has tended to orbit Russiaâs, in 2007 China edged out Russia as Kazakhstanâs top importer, and some critics fear that the B.R.I. is leading the country deeper into economic vassalage. âSome people think that China is too big,â Nygmet Ibadildin, an assistant professor of international relations at Kimep University, in Almaty, told me. âKazakh people want a win-win with the B.R.I., but in these situations China wins more often.â
Even in a country with few meaningful democratic rights, there are risks to courting foreign investment. In 2016, a proposed law that would have permitted parcels of farmland to be leased to Chinese companies sparked nationwide protests, leading Nazarbayev to table the measure.
The human rights crisis in Xinjiang has not helped Chinaâs standing in Kazakhstan, either, although the Kazakh government has been careful not to make any public statements that might alienate an important economic partner. While diplomats may be negotiating on behalf of ethnic Kazakhs in Xinjiang behind closed doors â in January, the Kazakh foreign ministry announced that China would allow 2,000 ethnic Kazakhs to give up their citizenship and cross the border into Kazakhstan â the government is not letting the presence of a prison state across the border interfere with its collaboration with China.
That may be largely thanks to the immediate economic concerns of both states, not to mention a shared penchant for autocracy, but it may also owe something to the unprecedented nature of the B.R.I. In many participating countries, the projectâs very novelty seems to lend itself to gauzy optimism. In September, the Chinese state-run media group Peopleâs Daily commemorated the fifth anniversary of the B.R.I. with a music video modeled after Coca-Colaâs famous 1971 âIâd Like to Buy the World a Cokeâ TV spot. The new video featured altered lyrics like âIâd like to build the world a road/And furnish it with love,â sung by smiling representatives of dozens of participant nations, decked out in ruquns, hijabs and dashikis. Rather than defining the initiative in any concrete way, the video slyly co-opts Cokeâs ability to serve as empty cipher, meaning anything to anyone. Whatever it is, the B.R.I. is âwhat the world needs today/Itâs the real thing.â
Khorgos Gateway rises out of the flat desert basin, a pale yellow moon base of cranes and storage silos into which, every so often, a freight train slowly rolls. A trio of rail-mounted gantry cranes loomed 50 feet overhead as I arrived on a damp, overcast morning. Khorgos Gateway may be the most advanced port in Central Asia, but it retains some of eastern Kazakhstanâs rustic atmosphere. When I walked into the lobby of the dry portâs main offices, a security guard was handing out apples he had picked in his garden.
The chief executive of Khorgos Gateway, Zhaslan Khamzin, welcomed me into a tidy office overlooking the freight yard. âThe future lies here,â he said proudly. Khorgos was blessed by its position in the middle of Eurasia. âLook at a map, and youâll see China on one side, Europe on the other, Russia to the north and the Caucasus and Iran to the west. Why am I pointing this out? Precisely because 90 percent of cargo traffic to these countries is currently made by sea.â
Since the dry portâs inaugural train passed through in 2015, Khamzin said, companies who manufacture goods in China have begun to recognize the advantages of a modernized overland trade route across Asia. The dry port has transferred John Deere combines to Azerbaijan, he claimed, and Hewlett-Packard parts to Western Europe. He added that it may be much cheaper to ship containers by sea, but it can take more than three times as long, and air transit is the most expensive by far. By contrast, a container passing through Khorgos can travel from a Chinese point of origin to Europe in about 14 days, faster than the sea and cheaper than the air. âWeâre going to be a central distribution point,â he concluded. If all goes well, according to company forecasts, in a few years Khorgos Gateway will be the largest dry port in the world.
Out in the shipping yard, wild dogs sniffed at stacked containers. It started to rain. A train had just pulled into port, and workers in yellow slickers were jogging out to meet it. Friendship between nations notwithstanding, Chinese border authorities are tight-lipped about freight schedules. The port sometimes learns about an impending arrival only an hour before it appears on the horizon, whereupon a swift ballet of machine and human movement begins. A siren blared as a gantry crane began to creep toward me through the mist. The three 41-ton cranes straddled six rail lines â three are the wide-gauge rails that stretch across the post-Soviet world from Helsinki to Ulaanbaatar; three are the standard gauge used in both China and Europe â and from my perspective they appeared to tower impossibly over the mountains around us. From a dangling control booth, a crane operator lowered containers onto their beds with dull-eyed expertise.
[What the worldâs emptiest international airport says about China.]
The national railway company of Kazakhstan owns 51 percent of Khorgos Gateway. The remaining 49 percent is split between two Chinese state-owned companies. Khamzin viewed Chinaâs participation not as economic imperialism but as proof of the portâs likelihood of success. The Chinese, he explained, âare the kind of people that if they saw no commercial opportunity, they wouldnât invest here.â
Such arrangements are less one-sided in Kazakhstan than in some of the more debt-strapped B.R.I. countries, so itâs very unlikely that what happened in Sri Lanka will happen here. But Chinese investments have in all likelihood muffled Kazakhstanâs response to the crackdown in Xinjiang.
Each train that arrives at Khorgos has to pass through the Chinese region, which is home to 24 million people, including more than 12 million Uighurs and about 1.5 million Kazakhs. Although political unrest has troubled the region for decades, including, in recent years, a spate of knife attacks and bombings by Uighur separatists, authorities in Xinjiang have responded with brutal asymmetry, rounding up hundreds of thousands of Uighurs alongside thousands of ethnic Kazakh and Kyrgyz residents in a sweeping internment drive the scope of which rivals Maoâs Cultural Revolution. Their âoffensesâ range from open displays of religious belief â wearing a beard, praying in public, owning a Quran or refusing to smoke or eat pork â to simply traveling with or even speaking to relatives abroad. For those not yet detained, Xinjiang has become a dystopian zone of extralegal checkpoints, patrols, GPS tracking and random home inspections.
Some experts say the camps and other security measures are partly in reaction to the increased freight traffic across Xinjiang, much of which now comes through Khorgos Gateway. âThe role of Xinjiang has changed greatly with the B.R.I.,â Adrian Zenz, an academic expert on Chinaâs minority policy, told me. Chinaâs B.R.I. ambitions have transformed Xinjiang from a fringe territory into what party leaders call a âcore regionâ of development. Thatâs why awareness of the camps among people in places like Kazakhstan was such an issue, Zenz said. âIt has significant potential to cast a very negative light on the Belt and Road.â
After my tour of the dry port, I headed a mile down the road to Nurkent, a newly built town of low bungalows and apartment blocks. For all its symbolic importance, Khorgos Gateway is still a modest operation; if it were a United States seaport, its 2018 throughput would place it somewhere around the 26th-largest in the country, beneath the ports of Mobile, Ala.; Boston; and Gulfport, Miss. There are just 190 employees, which Khamzin said was close to capacity, and most of them live in Nurkent, alongside railroad workers, police officers, border guards, customs officials and other agents of the new frontier. Except for the cawing of crows nesting within an apartment buildingâs crumbling gables, the town was silent. During a visit to the region in 2016, Nazarbayev predicted the population would grow and merge with Zharkent to form a large city, but this was hard to visualize. The site of a planned expansion was marked by a roundabout with a tiered silver gateway â the â2001â obelisk as imagined by Frank Gehry â through whose arch I could see only an untended field of scrubland.
As I stood looking at the archway, a car pulled up. A man in straw hat and sandals hoisted himself out of the passenger side. âI guard this place,â he said. He uncoiled a hose on the ground and began watering the grass around the gate. âThis is the double door to the future of Nurkent, where the city will rise up.â
Khorgosâs other major landmark is a boomtown of open borders known as the International Center for Boundary Cooperation, or I.C.B.C., which China and Kazakhstan established in 2011 about six miles from the dry port. Here it is not only the goods that move freely back and forth but also the people. In this duty- and visa-free zone, Kazakh citizens willing to brave the hourlong wait at customs control are permitted to enter a walled section of the Chinese side of Khorgos across the border to buy cheap linens and electronics, and Chinese tourists may enter a walled leisure area inside Kazakhstan to buy souvenirs and eat Kazakh delicacies like shashlik and laghman.
A United Nations human rights panel describes the entirety of Xinjiang as a âmassive internment camp,â but that didnât stop workers I met at the dry port from suggesting I cross into China by way of the I.C.B.C. Khorgos Gateway and the I.C.B.C. are the products of special economic development zones set up in coordination with China: industrial and commercial arenas designed to foster jobs and investments. There are dozens of such zones within China â the first, Shenzhen, is now a megacity of more than 12 million people â but Khorgos is the first to exist partly outside Chinaâs own borders. That will soon change. Chinese officials have announced plans to build 50 more international zones in countries from Algeria to Vietnam.
At Khorgos, the I.C.B.C. seems intended to complement the dry portâs vision of frictionless trade with an equivalent vision of borderless commerce, even if most Kazakhs understand the project as a wholesale depot for cheaply made Chinese goods. A popular hustle among shopkeepers from Almaty is to hire one of the locals who wait outside the I.C.B.C., and who are euphemistically called âcarriers,â to help circumvent the weight limits on imports. By all accounts, customs officials tend to look the other way.
My state-assigned guide picked me up at my hotel in Zharkent in a sleek Mercedes sedan that he drove as if we had just robbed a bank. âAre you nervous?â he asked, laughing, as we careered around a watermelon truck. His name was Marat Abaiuly. If the I.C.B.C. was the most important of Chinaâs outposts in Kazakhstan, Abaiuly was its ambassador, the handsome liaison to opinion makers and potential investors. He made his power known by blowing through checkpoints with a friendly honk or, if necessary, by leaping out of the car to grip the soldier on duty by the forearm.
It was 10 in the morning, and a line of wholesalers and hopeful carriers had formed beyond a fence topped with concertina wire. Bus drivers reclined inside their open cargo holds, chain-smoking and preparing to nap through the day. Inside the customs-control building, a construction worker was destroying the tile floor with a jackhammer. Improvised lines formed around the rubble.
China is said to be spending billions of dollars building up its side of Khorgos. By contrast, Kazakhstanâs share of the I.C.B.C. is mostly a dream of the future. Projects like a constellation of luxury hotels, a sports complex and a Disneyland-style theme park called Happy Land Khorgos have languished for lack of funding. Fields of rubble and stalled construction projects are scattered among the few small retail buildings and the yurt-shaped gift shops that are the Kazakh sideâs most distinctive feature.
In recent years, the name Khorgos has instead become synonymous among Kazakhs with smuggling rings and high-profile corruption cases. In 2011, authorities arrested the head of customs at Khorgos as part of a larger takedown of a $130 billion smuggling ring. In 2016, the former head of the I.C.B.C. was caught on tape accepting a $1 million bribe for a construction bid. Locals do not tend to figure in these public scandals, but based on the crowds I saw in front of the border checkpoint, informal gray-market carrying at Khorgos seems to have replaced animal husbandry as the regionâs main line of work. âMost locals work at the I.C.B.C. carrying cargo,â the chief executive of an Almaty-based truck transport company later told me, describing the work as a kind of pseudolegal smuggling. âThatâs how they make money.â
Abaiuly arranged for an I.C.B.C. van to drive us across the open border into China, where the main attractions for visiting Kazakhs are four large, windowless malls. The malls are honeycombed with shops where women of all ages and a few older men sell underwear, electronics and an array of other inexpensive products under fluorescent lights. One mall was dedicated entirely to fur coats, a gift of ritual significance in Kazakhstan, particularly between in-laws at weddings. It was early, and there were no customers anywhere. Floor after floor of identical shops stood empty, their racks of odorless pelts doubled and tripled by wall-length mirrors.
Some workers I met were Chinese citizens from Xinjiang. I had heard that, in some towns, even talking to a journalist is considered grounds for detention, so I didnât say much, and I was relieved to come across an outspoken furrier from Kazakhstan, Zhannur Erkenkyzy, who had worked at the border for six months. She got the job because she could speak Chinese, Russian, Uighur and Kazakh. She was also the storeâs model, she said, and she showed me her Instagram page, on which she appeared nestled inside the furs of minks, foxes and beavers, although at the moment she was wearing no fur at all, just a black cocktail dress that reflected no light.
Erkenkyzy said she worked seven days a week unless she happened to ask for a day off. The time involved in crossing the unpredictable border meant that the job occupied most of her waking life, of which one highlight was catching thieves. âWhen we see a shoplifter, we put on red armbands and beat them with sticks,â she said excitedly. Abaiuly interrupted, whispering in low, snappy Russian: âWhy are you saying such nasty stuff about us to the reporter?â
Back on the Kazakh side, we wandered the yurts, which were staffed by Chinese clerks who spoke no Russian or Kazakh. Tourists were milling about inside one of them, browsing rows of instant coffee, jade eggs and taxidermic hawks and antelopes. Outside, a row of golf carts and one stretch limousine waited to take the tourists back. I watched a group of women in ankle-length skirts cross a moonscape of rocks, heading toward China and dragging uselessly wheeled luggage behind them. When I asked Abaiuly about the prevalence of the carriers, he smiled. âOn that subject I cannot speak,â he said.
At an outdoor restaurant, I met a shashlik cook who lived inside one of the yurts where Chinese tourists ate. He left and re-entered the I.C.B.C. once a week to stay out of legal trouble, and said it was cheaper than living anywhere else.
One way to read the history of Central Asia is as a record of interactions between the mounted nomads who were long the primary occupants of the Eurasian Steppe and the sedentary populations who lived among them. As late as the 1930s, the dominant activity on the steppe was pastoral: herding sheep, goats and other livestock. Herders roamed in large, shifting clans on either side of the Tian Shan and Altai ranges, traveling on horseback and occasionally fragmenting or forming political alliances. These nomadic hordes proved unconquerable until the late 18th century, when they began to fall to Chinese conquest and, in what is now Kazakhstan, to Russian â later Soviet â rule.
In 1929, the leaders of the Soviet Union determined that Kazakhstanâs pastoral work force would go to work on farms. This forced collectivization was framed as a civilizing mission to modernize a population whom many Russians had long viewed as primitive barbarians. Land formerly devoted to grazing was irrigated and turned over to wheat production, with the immediate result that around 90 percent of the countryâs livestock died. The subsequent famine caused the deaths of one-quarter of the population of Kazakhstan and anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of all ethnic Kazakhs, a human-made catastrophe that ended nomadism as it had been practiced in the region for thousands of years. Kazakhs became a minority in the nation the Soviets had founded in their name.
Nomadic pastoralism remains central to Kazakh mythology â Nazarbayev describes himself as âthe son, grandson and great-grandson of herdersâ â but as a practice it has retreated to the periphery of the countryâs economy. Most of the surviving herders in this part of Kazakhstan practice a form of seminomadism known as transhumance, alternating between winters in a low-altitude village and summers in a pasture, or zhailau, in the mountains. I wondered how those in the mountains above Khorgos were reacting to the economic foment that had emerged around their winter homes. One morning I visited a village of herders in the Zhongar Alatau, a northern stretch of the Tian Shan named for the last nomadic khanate to rule over the steppes of western China.
It was Friday, and most of the men were at the village mosque. I asked the local damkeeperâs son, who said his name was Turar, to take me farther into the mountains where families graze their herds throughout the summer. I got into Turarâs old Lada four-wheel drive, and we rattled and bounced up the edge of a steep bank that commanded a wide prospect of sand dunes and crumpled foothills. Hawks gyred overhead. I thought to myself that the beauty of Kazakhstan defied description, but Turar, who had lived here all his life, managed to capture its pristine emptiness. âItâs like a screen,â he said cryptically. Then, to clarify: âLike a computer. Like the Windows screen.â
To reach the zhailau, we left Turarâs car at the dam where his family controls the flow of snowmelt and mountain spring through a Soviet-era irrigation canal. Before long, we arrived at an emerald slope where a single yurt sat embosomed in alpine lushness. Turar said this area was called the Black Gorge.
A friend of Turarâs emerged from the yurt, blinking at the sun. His name was Arsen Akhatay, and heâd been napping. Every spring, he helped drive the family livestock, a few hundred sheep and 50 cows and horses, up to the zhailau and tended them. He returned to the village when school started in the fall, leaving his parents to drive the animals back down. In between, there was a lot of free time. Sometimes he passed it playing kokpar, a popular Central Asian sport in which players fight over a headless goat carcass while on horseback. Akhatay was the attacker on his local team and was meant to be at training camp this week for nationals, but heâd fallen sick instead. He surveyed his sheep without enthusiasm. Each was labeled in resin with a large â5â marking it as a member of his familyâs flock. A solar panel staked into the ground near the doorway to the yurt powered a Chinese-made radio and a four-inch TV set. Turar gestured farther into the gorge, where Akhatayâs family pastured their horses a mile or so in, and said that if you kept on in that direction, youâd hit China.
Akhatay was wearing a blue camouflage jacket, the kind worn by Kazakh police officers on field exercises. His cousin came out of the yurt wearing the same thing. During the school year they lived in a village near Zharkent called Turpan. Akhatay, who was about to start his senior year of high school, said he did not intend to look after sheep his whole life. I asked whether he wanted a job at Khorgos.
âMany people from the village work at the border as carriers,â he said. âThere are many official jobs but also many unofficial.â All things being equal, he said, he wanted an official one. When he graduated, he planned to enroll at the military institute in Almaty to become a border guard.
On our drive down the mountain there was nothing to displease the eye, and before long we arrived at yet another small mountain village of white birches and potato gardens. Turar parked the car by a water pump and introduced me to a former classmate, a Kazakh named Zholaman Tashimkhan, who had come out to greet us.
We sat on the curb near the pump. Like Arsen, Tashimkhan spent most of the summer up in the mountains, but he was older and had already been drawn to the jobs at the border. He worked for a year for the railroad, a good job that is hard to come by through normal channels â âI used my connections,â he said, and laughed â but then his sisterâs husband found him work as a carrier. âItâs not an official job,â he said. âNot a public job.â
A few men from the village began to gather around the pump as we talked. Tashimkhan explained that he had worked for a wholesaler based in Zharkent, crossing into the I.C.B.C. four or five days a week to bring household products, mostly bedsheets and linens, back into Kazakhstan. He was paid according to how much he managed to get through customs. On an average day, he might earn $15 or $20 â good money â and occasionally as much as $60. Customs enforcement was lax. âFor us, you talk to the official working there, and you just bring things out,â he said.
More villagers had come out to the road until they completed a circle around us. Tashimkhan changed the subject, then joked with a friend that he was starting to think he would regret talking to me. An older man who had been pacing the street squatted down beside us and began conspicuously sharpening a sickle a few inches from my head. Turar suggested it was time for us to continue down the mountain. We got into the Lada and drove off.
The great commonplace of our time also happens to be true: The world is more connected than ever before. But if it is more connected, the world is also more administered â its people more coerced and surveilled, more susceptible to the designs of authoritarian leaders and more dependent on the fortunes of mercurial international markets â than at any point in human history. If the first fact has made some parts of the world freer, the second has made the rest of it less so.
A continuing trial at the local courthouse in Zharkent underscored this inversion, which seemed to me to lie at the heart of the developments at Khorgos. The case concerned Sayragul Sauytbay, a Chinese-born Kazakh woman who had fled Xinjiang and was requesting political asylum in Kazakhstan. Before the crackdown in Xinjiang, ethnic Kazakhs freely crossed the border to visit friends and relatives. But in 2016, as crossings became increasingly fraught, Sauytbayâs husband and two children decided to move permanently to Kazakhstan. Sauytbay, who was working in Xinjiang as a kindergarten director, remained in China with plans to join them; the rest of the family became Kazakh citizens in 2017. For more than a year, they met only in the free-trade zone at the I.C.B.C.
On April 5, 2018, without telling anyone, Sauytbay entered the I.C.B.C. with forged identity papers, then slipped into Kazakhstan by posing as a member of a tour group. A few weeks later, she was arrested and charged with entering the country illegally, and then her story began to emerge. Not long after her family had left China, Sauytbay was assigned to work at one of Xinjiangâs notorious detention camps. In her testimony, she described it as âa prison in the mountains,â with high walls and barbed wire that kept in some 2,500 inmates. She said she was forced by authorities to accept a teaching job there, indoctrinating the inmates in state propaganda, and she was warned that the penalty for revealing any information about the camps was death. The authorities confiscated her passport.
At her trial, Sauytbay provided some of the earliest testimony about life in Xinjiangâs camps. Her case made headlines in Kazakhstanâs national newspapers. She was married to a Kazakh citizen and was herself a âreturnee,â a member of the diaspora of ethnic Kazakhs the government has been courting for years. But now prosecutors at Sauytbayâs trial were arguing that she should be deported back to China, where she claimed she would be arrested or even killed for having made public her knowledge of the camps.
Most people Iâd met in Almaty seemed to think she had little chance of receiving asylum, much less Kazakh citizenship. The acquittal rate in criminal trials in Kazakhstan is around 1 percent, and hasnât changed since the days of the Soviet Union. There was also the B.R.I. to consider. Kazakhstan might decide Chinese investment was more important than any international agreements on refugees. It wouldnât be the first time a country was so swayed. In 2017, Greece vetoed a European Union statement criticizing Chinaâs human rights record at the United Nations, a decision that critics linked to Chinaâs controlling interest not just in Greeceâs largest port but also in its public power grid. In January, China hosted a Silk Road Celebrity China Tour, inviting journalists from six B.R.I. partner countries â Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka â on a highly choreographed tour of a âvocational centerâ in Kashgar, another famous stop on the ancient Silk Road. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, the visitors uniformly âpraised the development and stabilityâ of Xinjiang. An editor from Bangladesh singled out the regionâs contributions âto the nonoccurrence of violence and terrorism.â
My last day in town coincided with what turned out to be the last day of Sauytbayâs trial. About 100 supporters had risen early and driven out from Almaty to the courthouse, which was opposite a park where marble busts of Soviet heroes watched over a playground. When the courtroom opened, the crowd crushed against the glass doors. I made it through with a handful of other reporters thanks to some strategic shoving by a few veteran activists; most of the crowd remained on the courthouse steps.
As the proceedings began, Sauytbayâs lawyer introduced into evidence a copy of the asylum application that she had just filed. Both the judge and prosecutor interrogated Sauytbay, who from behind a clear protective wall related how, when she was arrested by the Kazakh police, an official told her that she would be sent back to China to die and her children would become orphans.
Sauytbay freely admitted sheâd escaped China illegally. She was willing to serve a prison sentence. She just didnât want to be sent back. âThere is no reason for me to live if I am not with my children,â she told the judge. Her family sat across the room, near an open window through which we could hear the crowd murmuring outside.
The prosecution had previously rejected any kind of a plea deal. So what happened next was that rare thing: a dramatic courtroom reversal. In a closing statement, the prosecutor cited the outpouring of support the case had received across Kazakhstan. She requested that the judge allow Sauytbay to serve out a period of probation at her husbandâs house. âI ask you not to apply deportation,â she said. âI ask you to set her free in the courtroom.â Sauytbayâs eyes went wide. Her lawyer, who seemed stunned, agreed. A few moments later, sounds of cheering rang out on the courthouse steps.
âI was surprised the law was kept,â Rysbek Sarsenbay, a prominent opposition activist, told me later. He reasoned that the government must have weighed the consequences of deporting Sauytbay carefully against the risk of alienating Chinaâs leadership. âEven as a dictatorship,â he said, âKazakhstan must honor its international commitments.â
Once the judge issued the expected ruling â prosecutors and judges in Kazakhstan rarely disagree â Sauytbay was ushered from the courthouse to the top of the steps, where she embraced her son and thanked President Nazarbayev for his beneficence. A poet took the stage to extemporize a victory verse in Kazakh. The crowd repaired to a restaurant a few miles outside Zharkent, where a spontaneous release party began with the singing of the national anthem. Waiters descended with plates of beshbarmak, a national dish of boiled noodles and horse meat in onion sauce. When Sauytbay arrived, holding her son in her arms, everyone stood up and clapped. She told me she hoped her testimony would âshine a light of hopeâ for her compatriots in China. âThey know there is a country that will always protect them,â she said.
The celebration may have been premature. As Sauytbay later told The Globe and Mail of Toronto, within a day of her release, her sister and two friends were arrested in Xinjiang â they have since disappeared into camps â and in October Kazakhstan denied Sauytbayâs asylum claim. For the time being, she is living at home with her family, but her legal status in Kazakhstan is uncertain.
Even if she manages to avoid deportation, Sauytbay is one of thousands of people with ties to Kazakhstan who have found themselves caught up in Xinjiangâs detention centers. At the release party, I found myself sitting next to a Kazakh woman named Qarlyghash Ziparova, whose nephew, a former Xinjiang official named Askar Azatbek, had disappeared inside the ostensibly neutral free trade zone of the I.C.B.C. Azatbek, who had become a Kazakh citizen a few months earlier, entered the I.C.B.C. in 2017 with a friend, whereupon a group of men drove up in two cars and detained them. The friend was released, but Azatbek was hauled off. They hadnât even been on the Chinese side, the friend had said. Ziparova tried to complain to authorities in Kazakhstan, but without any luck. The I.C.B.C. told her there was no surveillance video, although she didnât believe it. She didnât understand how a Kazakh citizen could be taken away by China like that â without even a trial.
The ancient Silk Road was equal parts trade route and social network. The routes themselves were in constant flux and administered by no one, and they succeeded through incremental growth and local knowledge in response to changing needs â the exact opposite of the Ozymandian ambitions and sweeping autocratic statecraft that characterize the Belt and Road. For all its potential to create jobs and modernize infrastructures, the project has also created a halo of mass internment camps for the powerless and gray-market economies for the poor. While new official jobs in Khorgos are lifting a lucky few out of poverty, it is far more common to find farmers and herders moonlighting as taxi drivers, security guards or smugglers, part of a precarious network of low-paid freelancers. Such work is susceptible by design to sudden changes in enforcement and depends on a constant influx of disposable workers. It seemed like a high cost for connecting the world.
I hired a taxi to drive me back to Almaty. We took a new highway that opened last year, part of a growing highway system affiliated with the B.R.I. and known as the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor. The highway cuts the travel time in half, from six hours to just over three hours, and driving atop it felt like riding an air-hockey puck. There were no rest stops or gas stations, and the few landmarks I could see stood at an unobtrusive distance. They included an old train station, a pumping house for a Chinese oil pipeline and the alien forms of a half-built wind farm courtesy of SANY Group, the Chinese manufacturing behemoth. As the sun became a narrow red eye on the horizon, a dust storm descended the cliffs to our left and crossed the road into empty veld. There were no cars in sight. It was less a road than the idea of a road.
The driver didnât know anything about the trial whose outcome I had just seen. He had never heard of Sayragul Sauytbay. He was happy to have such a fine new highway on which to drive his customers back and forth between Khorgos and Almaty. Kazakhstan, we agreed, was a beautiful country. He pointed to some fields he said would be full of cattle in the fall, then opened the sunroof and stuck his hand into the night air.

"China Uses DNA to Track Its People, With the Help of American Expertise","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245616885?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â The authorities called it a free health check. Tahir Imin had his doubts.
They drew blood from the 38-year-old Muslim, scanned his face, recorded his voice and took his fingerprints. They didnât bother to check his heart or kidneys, and they rebuffed his request to see the results.
âThey said, âYou donât have the right to ask about this,ââ Mr. Imin said. ââIf you want to ask more,â they said, âyou can go to the police.ââ
Mr. Imin was one of millions of people caught up in a vast Chinese campaign of surveillance and oppression. To give it teeth, the Chinese authorities are collecting DNA â and they got unlikely corporate and academic help from the United States to do it.
China wants to make the countryâs Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, more subservient to the Communist Party. It has detained up to a million people in what China calls âre-educationâ camps, drawing condemnation from human rights groups and a threat of sanctions from the Trump administration.
Collecting genetic material is a key part of Chinaâs campaign, according to human rights groups and Uighur activists. They say a comprehensive DNA database could be used to chase down any Uighurs who resist conforming to the campaign.
Police forces in the United States and elsewhere use genetic material from family members to find suspects and solve crimes. Chinese officials, who are building a broad nationwide database of DNA samples, have cited the crime-fighting benefits of Chinaâs own genetic studies.
To bolster their DNA capabilities, scientists affiliated with Chinaâs police used equipment made by Thermo Fisher, a Massachusetts company. For comparison with Uighur DNA, they also relied on genetic material from people around the world that was provided by Kenneth Kidd, a prominent Yale University geneticist.
On Wednesday, Thermo Fisher said it would no longer sell its equipment in Xinjiang, the part of China where the campaign to track Uighurs is mostly taking place. The company said separately in an earlier statement to The New York Times that it was working with American officials to figure out how its technology was being used.
Dr. Kidd said he had been unaware of how his material and know-how were being used. He said he believed Chinese scientists were acting within scientific norms that require informed consent by DNA donors.
Chinaâs campaign poses a direct challenge to the scientific community and the way it makes cutting-edge knowledge publicly available. The campaign relies in part on public DNA databases and commercial technology, much of it made or managed in the United States. In turn, Chinese scientists have contributed Uighur DNA samples to a global database, potentially violating scientific norms of consent.
Cooperation from the global scientific community âlegitimizes this type of genetic surveillance,â said Mark Munsterhjelm, an assistant professor at the University of Windsor in Ontario who has closely tracked the use of American technology in Xinjiang.
Swabbing Millions
In Xinjiang, in northwestern China, the program was known as âPhysicals for All.â
From 2016 to 2017, nearly 36 million people took part in it, according to Xinhua, Chinaâs official news agency. The authorities collected DNA samples, images of irises and other personal data, according to Uighurs and human rights groups. It is unclear whether some residents participated more than once â Xinjiang has a population of about 24.5 million.
In a statement, the Xinjiang government denied that it collects DNA samples as part of the free medical checkups. It said the DNA machines that were bought by the Xinjiang authorities were for âinternal use.â
China has for decades maintained an iron grip in Xinjiang. In recent years, it has blamed Uighurs for a series of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China, including a 2013 incident in which a driver struck two people in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
In late 2016, the Communist Party embarked on a campaign to turn the Uighurs and other largely Muslim minority groups into loyal supporters. The government locked up hundreds of thousands of them in what it called job training camps, touted as a way to escape poverty, backwardness and radical Islam. It also began to take DNA samples.
In at least some of the cases, people didnât give up their genetic material voluntarily. To mobilize Uighurs for the free medical checkups, police and local cadres called or sent them text messages, telling them the checkups were required, according to Uighurs interviewed by The Times.
âThere was a pretty strong coercive element to it,â said Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who studies the plight of the Uighurs. âThey had no choice.â
Calling Dr. Kidd
Kenneth Kidd first visited China in 1981 and remained curious about the country. So when he received an invitation in 2010 for an expenses-paid trip to visit Beijing, he said yes.
Dr. Kidd is a major figure in the genetics field. The 77-year-old Yale professor has helped to make DNA evidence more acceptable in American courts.
His Chinese hosts had their own background in law enforcement. They were scientists from the Ministry of Public Security â essentially, Chinaâs police.
During that trip, Dr. Kidd met Li Caixia, the chief forensic physician of the ministryâs Institute of Forensic Science. The relationship deepened. In December 2014, Dr. Li arrived at Dr. Kiddâs lab for an 11-month stint. She took some DNA samples back to China.
âI had thought we were sharing samples for collaborative research,â said Dr. Kidd.
Dr. Kidd is not the only prominent foreign geneticist to have worked with the Chinese authorities. Bruce Budowle, a professor at the University of North Texas, says in his online biography that he âhas served or is servingâ as a member of an academic committee at the ministryâs Institute of Forensic Science.
Jeff Carlton, a university spokesman, said in a statement that Professor Budowleâs role with the ministry was âonly symbolic in natureâ and that he had âdone no work on its behalf.â
âDr. Budowle and his team abhor the use of DNA technology to persecute ethnic or religious groups,â Mr. Carlton said in the statement. âTheir work focuses on criminal investigations and combating human trafficking to serve humanity.â
Dr. Kiddâs data became part of Chinaâs DNA drive.
In 2014, ministry researchers published a paper describing a way for scientists to tell one ethnic group from another. It cited, as an example, the ability to distinguish Uighurs from Indians. The authors said they used 40 DNA samples taken from Uighurs in China and samples from other ethnic groups from Dr. Kiddâs Yale lab.
In patent applications filed in China in 2013 and 2017, ministry researchers described ways to sort people by ethnicity by screening their genetic makeup. They took genetic material from Uighurs and compared it with DNA from other ethnic groups. In the 2017 filing, researchers explained that their system would help in âinferring the geographical origin from the DNA of suspects at crime scenes.â
For outside comparisons, they used DNA samples provided by Dr. Kiddâs lab, the 2017 filing said. They also used samples from the 1000 Genomes Project, a public catalog of genes from around the world.
Paul Flicek, member of the steering committee of the 1000 Genomes Project, said that its data was unrestricted and that âthere is no obvious problemâ if it was being used as a way to determine where a DNA sample came from.
The data flow also went the other way.
Chinese government researchers contributed the data of 2,143 Uighurs to the Allele Frequency Database, an online search platform run by Dr. Kidd that was partly funded by the United States Department of Justice until last year. The database, known as Alfred, contains DNA data from more than 700 populations around the world.
This sharing of data could violate scientific norms of informed consent because it is not clear whether the Uighurs volunteered their DNA samples to the Chinese authorities, said Arthur Caplan, the founding head of the division of medical ethics at New York Universityâs School of Medicine. He said that âno one should be in a database without express consent.â
âHonestly, thereâs been a kind of naÃ¯vetÃ© on the part of American scientists presuming that other people will follow the same rules and standards wherever they come from,â Dr. Caplan said.
Dr. Kidd said he was ânot particularly happyâ that the ministry had cited him in its patents, saying his data shouldnât be used in ways that could allow people or institutions to potentially profit from it. If the Chinese authorities used data they got from their earlier collaborations with him, he added, there is little he can do to stop them.
He said he was unaware of the filings until he was contacted by The Times.
Dr. Kidd also said he considered his collaboration with the ministry to be no different from his work with police and forensics labs elsewhere. He said governments should have access to data about minorities, not just the dominant ethnic group, in order to have an accurate picture of the whole population.
As for the consent issue, he said the burden of meeting that standard lay with the Chinese researchers, though he said reports about what Uighurs are subjected to in China raised some difficult questions.
âI would assume they had appropriate informed consent on the samples,â he said, âthough I must say what Iâve been hearing in the news recently about the treatment of the Uighurs raises concerns.â
Machine Learning
In 2015, Dr. Kidd and Dr. Budowle spoke at a genomics conference in the Chinese city of Xiâan. It was underwritten in part by Thermo Fisher, a company that has come under intense criticism for its equipment sales in China, and Illumina, a San Diego company that makes gene sequencing instruments. Illumina did not respond to requests for comment.
China is ramping up spending on health care and research. The Chinese market for gene-sequencing equipment and other technologies was worth $1 billion in 2017 and could more than double in five years, according to CCID Consulting, a research firm. But the Chinese market is loosely regulated, and it isnât always clear where the equipment goes or to what uses it is put.
Thermo Fisher sells everything from lab instruments to forensic DNA testing kits to DNA mapping machines, which help scientists decipher a personâs ethnicity and identify diseases to which he or she is particularly vulnerable. China accounted for 10 percent of Thermo Fisherâs $20.9 billion in revenue, according to the companyâs 2017 annual report, and it employs nearly 5,000 people there.
âOur greatest success story in emerging markets continues to be China,â it said in the report.
China used Thermo Fisherâs equipment to map the genes of its people, according to five Ministry of Public Security patent filings.
The company has also sold equipment directly to the authorities in Xinjiang, where the campaign to control the Uighurs has been most intense. At least some of the equipment was intended for use by the police, according to procurement documents. The authorities there said in the documents that the machines were important for DNA inspections in criminal cases and had âno substitutes in China.â
In February 2013, six ministry researchers credited Thermo Fisherâs Applied Biosystems brand, as well as other companies, with helping to analyze the DNA samples of Han, Uighur and Tibetan people in China, according to a patent filing. The researchers said understanding how to differentiate between such DNA samples was necessary for fighting terrorism âbecause these cases were becoming more difficult to crack.â
The researchers said they had obtained 95 Uighur DNA samples, some of which were given to them by the police. Other samples were provided by Uighurs voluntarily, they said.
Thermo Fisher was criticized by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and others who asked the Commerce Department to prohibit American companies from selling technology to China that could be used for purposes of surveillance and tracking.
On Wednesday, Thermo Fisher said it would stop selling its equipment in Xinjiang, a decision it said was âconsistent with Thermo Fisherâs values, ethics code and policies.â
âAs the world leader in serving science, we recognize the importance of considering how our products and services are used â or may be used â by our customers,â it said.
Human rights groups praised Thermo Fisherâs move. Still, they said, equipment and information flows into China should be better monitored, to make sure the authorities elsewhere donât send them to Xinjiang.
âItâs an important step, and one hopes that they apply the language in their own statement to commercial activity across China, and that other companies are assessing their sales and operations, especially in Xinjiang,â said Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch.
American lawmakers and officials are taking a hard look at the situation in Xinjiang. The Trump administration is considering sanctions against Chinese officials and companies over Chinaâs treatment of the Uighurs.
Chinaâs tracking campaign unnerved people like Tahir Hamut. In May 2017, the police in the city of Urumqi in Xinjiang drew the 49-year-old Uighurâs blood, took his fingerprints, recorded his voice and took a scan of his face. He was called back a month later for what he was told was a free health check at a local clinic.
Mr. Hamut, a filmmaker who is now living in Virginia, said he saw between 20 to 40 Uighurs in line. He said it was absurd to think that such frightened people had consented to submit their DNA.
âNo one in this situation, not under this much pressure and facing such personal danger, would agree to give their blood samples for research,â Mr. Hamut said. âItâs just inconceivable.â

Chinaâs Entrepreneurs Are Wary of Its Future,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docvi ew/2245614154?accountid=14586,"Chen Tianyong, a Chinese real estate developer in Shanghai, boarded a flight to Malta last month with no plans to return anytime soon.
After landing, Mr. Chen, a former judge and lawyer, shared on social media a 28-page article explaining himself. âWhy I Left China,â read the headline, âAn Entrepreneurâs Farewell Admonition.â
âChinaâs economy is like a giant ship heading to the precipice,â Mr. Chen wrote. âWithout fundamental changes, itâs inevitable that the ship will be wrecked and the passengers will die.â
âMy friends,â he urged, âif you can leave, please make arrangements as early as possible.â
It is unclear how many people saw the article before it disappeared from Chinaâs heavily censored internet. But Mr. Chen said publicly what many businesspeople in China are saying privately: Chinaâs leadership has mismanaged the worldâs second-largest economy, and Chinaâs entrepreneur class is losing confidence in the countryâs future.
For more than a generation, China has been fueled by optimism that, despite its problems, tomorrow will be better than today. Now, the prevailing view is best summed up by an online meme made popular by Wang Xing, the founder and chief executive of Meituan Dianping, the online delivery and takeout company. The year 2019, goes the meme, may be the worst year in this decade, but it will be the best year in the next decade.
Chinaâs economy is slowing, and the trade war with the United States has pinched growth. But many entrepreneurs are more broadly worried that China wonât pursue the economic and political liberalization it needs. On the contrary, since Xi Jinping took control of the Communist Party in 2012, the party has increased its dominance in every aspect of Chinese society.
Few are predicting a crash, but worries over Chinaâs long-term prospects are growing. Pessimism is so high, in fact, that some businesspeople are comparing Chinaâs potential future to another country where the government seized control of the economy and didnât ease up: Venezuela.
Only one-third of Chinaâs rich people say they are very confident in the countryâs economic prospects, according to a recent survey of 465 wealthy individuals by Hurun, a Shanghai-based research firm. Two years ago, nearly two-thirds said they were very confident. Those who have no confidence at all rose to 14 percent, more than double the level of 2018. Nearly half said they were considering migrating to a foreign country or had already started the process.
âChina is facing a lot of internal and external challenges now,â said Fred Hu, founder of the investment firm Primavera Capital Group and former head of Goldman Sachsâs Greater China business. âWe need to realize that all of our achievements in the past 40 years were the results of opening up and economic reform, not because of any unique China development model.â
Mr. Huâs comments are diplomatic. In private, some businesspeople are talking in angrier and more fearful ways. They asked for anonymity, of course. In todayâs tightly controlled environment in China, even the economy â once considered a safe subject â has become dangerous to talk about.
âThe most important cause of their pessimism is bad policy and bad leadership,â said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who is in frequent contact with business figures. âItâs clear to the private businesspeople that the moment the government doesnât need them, itâll slaughter them like pigs. This is not a government that respects the law. It can change on a dime.â
Many members of the business elite are unhappy that the leadershipâs economic policies favor state-owned enterprises even though the private sector drives growth. They are angry that the party is trying to put a Mao-era ideological straitjacket on an economy driven by private enterprises and young consumers. They are upset that the party eliminated term limits last year, raising the prospect that Mr. Xi could become president for life.
Many businesspeople feel increasingly insecure, especially as some entrepreneurs are âdisappearedâ by the government to assist in the anticorruption campaigns.
âIn the eyes of some senior officials, even people like Jack Ma and Pony Ma are just small-time businessmen,â Mr. Chen said in an interview, referring to the founders of Alibaba and Tencent, two of Chinaâs biggest private enterprises.
Mr. Xi appears to be aware of the unease. Beijing has postponed new rules that would raise business taxes to pay for social benefits and has eased its monetary and fiscal policies.
Still, the partyâs priorities appear to be elsewhere. In his December speech commemorating 40 years of Chinaâs opening, Mr. Xi argued that his recipe of guided growth under strong Communist Party control must not waver. In another important speech to the partyâs top officials last month, Mr. Xi identified seven major risks for national security, with politics and ideology topping the list, and he called for tighter control of young people and the internet.
Chinaâs power structure lacks a way to counterbalance this trend. A few young hedge fund managers told me over dinner in Hong Kong that the trade war with President Trump could be a blessing in disguise because it might force Beijing to undertake structural reforms to reach a deal. Only Mr. Trump can save China, it is often said at private gatherings, only half-jokingly.
âThe trade war is a bad thing to begin with,â said Mr. Hu of Primavera Capital. âBut if the final resolutions lead to renewed efforts by China to undertake broad structural reforms, it will be a win-win situation for the U.S., China and the world.â
The relationship between the business elite and the party wasnât always like this. Some businesspeople cheered Mr. Xi when he came to power, his anticorruption crackdown signaling to them that he was building a rules-based society. But disillusioned executives told me that tighter government control means more bureaucrats have a say in business matters, and corruption simply takes different forms.
Can it be stopped? Some businesspeople are pessimistic. Mr. Chen, the real estate developer, says the solution is to leave.
Itâs impossible to say how many people agree. Even those who have left China may still run businesses there, making them reluctant to speak out. Plus, the country still has many optimists who say this rough patch wonât last.
But many of Chinaâs rich have been voting with their feet. The number of Chinese people moving to the United States on investor visas has surged in recent years. Of the one million foreign students in the United States, one-third are from China.
Now 53, Mr. Chen decided in early 2013 that he had better start looking at places outside mainland China. The trigger was a widely circulated party directive that urged an offensive against liberal political ideas and values. âIt was a very terrifying signal,â he said.
He first secured permanent resident status in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, but concerns about its autonomy have grown since Beijing responded fiercely to pro-democracy protests there in 2014. He applied for the investor visa to the United States, but the wait time was too long.
He then bought more than a dozen apartments in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and urged his relatives and close friends to do the same. He called it his Noahâs Ark plan, to prepare for the destructive flood that China might experience. But his Malaysia visa was valid for only 10 years.
Mr. Chen said he had finally settled on Malta because it was warm, beautiful and a member of the European Union, which meant he would be able to travel to other countries in the bloc.
For the entrepreneur class, he said, leaving China is the best way to resist Communist rule. Once people leave, they will manage to take at least some assets with them despite the strict capital controls the government has imposed in recent years. They can come back when the circumstances change, Mr. Chen said, much like many overseas Chinese did in the 1980s and â90s.
Mr. Chen is learning English and exploring his interest in religion. He still has some businesses in China but doesnât need to tend to them in person. He said he had never really considered changing his citizenship because life was tough for first-generation immigrants. He only wanted to find a safe place for his family, he said, to protect against a worst-case scenario that he believes will materialize unless thereâs a miracle.
âI didnât expect my article would be circulated so widely,â he said. âFor the time being, it might be best that I stay out of China.â

"Traveling to Meet Trump, Kim Jong-un Takes the Long Route","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245630143?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â The young leader of North Korea likes to present himself as a modern man projecting his isolated country onto the world stage.
But for his meeting with President Trump in Vietnam this week, Kim Jong-un is traveling south through China in an armored train â not even a high-speed one â and then planning to drive the last leg to Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital. The journey is expected to take as long as two days from the starting point in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, instead of a few hours by plane.
His unusual itinerary can be explained by geopolitics, the rickety state of North Korean aircraft and a bit of history.
Mr. Kim, who left the railway station in Pyongyang on Saturday, appears to be indulging China by taking such a protracted trip. His khaki-green train will take him past glistening cities and productive countryside that show off the countryâs four decades of blazing economic growth.
China has played host to Mr. Kim four times in the past year, in an effort to impress upon the North Korean leader that China, not the United States, is his best bet as an economic model. In turn, Mr. Kim, 35, has dutifully toured Chinese green energy projects and high-tech ventures, and shown deference to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, who is almost twice his age.
But the young leader chafes at Chinaâs hold, and his train trip shows that there are limits to it.
When he traveled to meet Mr. Trump for the first time in Singapore last June, Mr. Kim borrowed a Boeing 747 belonging to the national carrier, Air China. (His own Soviet-made Ilyushin Il-62 is almost 40 years old and short of spare parts.)
The train journey suggests that he was reluctant to do so again.
âHe does not want to show the world his heavy reliance on China by waving his hand in front of Chinaâs national flag on a Chinese plane as he did at the Singapore airport,â said Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at Renmin University in Beijing.
The resulting jokes about North Korea being a province of China apparently did not sit well with Mr. Kim. âTraveling by train is a forced choice,â Mr. Cheng said.
Until Mr. Kim arrived in the Chinese border city of Dandong late Saturday, Chinese analysts doubted that the North Korean leader would bring his own train across China. The security demands would entail too much upheaval to the regular schedules for Chinaâs vast fleet of heavily used high-speed trains, they said.
But China is clearly willing to make the sacrifice, said Yun Sun, an analyst at the Stimson Center in Washington.
âThe Chinese see the trip as a sign of North Koreaâs complete trust and that only China can guarantee his safety,â Ms. Yun said. âAnd every time North Korean leaders travel through China, the hope is to show them how great economic reform is.â
The train journey affords a nice symmetry with the travels of Mr. Kimâs grandfather Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea, to whom the young leader bears a strong resemblance.
Kim Il-sung first visited Vietnam in November 1958. Like the current Mr. Kim, he went to China first before venturing to Vietnam, where he was greeted by the Communist leader Ho Chi Minh.
Photographs from that 1958 trip that appeared this weekend in the Chinese state newspaper The Global Times show the portly Kim Il-sung with sharply barbered black hair embracing the reed-thin Ho Chi Minh, who a few years later would be battling the United States with help from China and North Korea.
Mr. Kim toured Beijing, Wuhan and Guangzhou, according to The Global Times, and then arrived in Hanoi on a special plane provided by China. The newspaper did not mention that by the late 1950s, North Korea was beginning to recover from its war with the United States, and doing better than China, where a devastating famine was sweeping rural areas.
The current North Korean leader appears to be taking a similar route as his grandfather, with some tweaks. It is unclear how much sightseeing is planned.
From Dandong, in the northeastern rust belt of China, Mr. Kim is likely to see the skylines of Wuhan and Changsha, among the most developed cities in central China (the trainâs reported speed: about 35 miles per hour).
He will see Chinaâs two major waterways, the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, and arrive at the Vietnamese border south of Guilin, a city revered among the Chinese for its mountainous landscape.
In a sign of the rivalry between China and its southern neighbor, Vietnam has deliberately continued to use different spacing on its railroad tracks, which in the past made it more difficult for China to invade, Mr. Cheng said.
So Mr. Kim will have to leave his train at the border with Vietnam. He will travel the last 105 miles or so to Hanoi by road, Vietnamese officials say, a winding route through low mountains.
Before meeting Mr. Trump, Mr. Kim is planning talks with leaders of Vietnamâs Communist Party during what is being billed as a state visit, similar to the one made by his grandfather.
The big question for Mr. Kim is whether his courting of China â the train journey is his fifth trip to China within a year â will pay off with real support.
Above all, Mr. Kim wants Beijing to urge the United Nations to ease sanctions against North Korea. That is also expected to be his major request of Mr. Trump in Hanoi.
Mr. Trump suggested in a Twitter post on Sunday that he expected China to stand firm on keeping sanctions in place. âSanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful,â he said.
Overturning the sanctions is likely to require more than a train ride through China and a show of interest in Chinaâs economic model, Ms. Yun said.
So far, China has urged the United Nations to ease some sanctions, and Beijing may reward Mr. Kim with more agricultural aid starting in the spring. But that is probably the limit, she said.
âI donât think China wants to cross Trump at this point â the price is too high considering the trade deal,â she said, referring to the trade talks between Washington and Beijing that are reaching a critical point.

"Trump Touts Progress With China, but Pressure Grows for a Tough Deal","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245615570?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â President Trumpâs decision to back off his threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods carries substantial political risk as the president faces increased pressure from Republicans, Democrats and some of his own advisers to win the kind of tough concessions that Beijing has long resisted.
Citing âsubstantial progressâ in talks between the United States and China, Mr. Trump on Sunday evening halted plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods at the end of this week. On Monday, the president predicted that President Xi Jinping of China would soon join him at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trumpâs Florida resort, for a âsigning summit.â
âWeâre getting very, very close,â Mr. Trump said at a gathering of governors at the White House.
Mr. Trumpâs optimism has cheered Wall Street and business lobbyists, who have been pushing for a quick end to the trade war. But Democrats and even some Republicans are not so sanguine.
Top Democrats, in an effort to outflank Mr. Trump on China, are warning loudly that the Chinese may simply be dangling false promises in hopes of getting the president to end a trade war that is hurting American farmers and damaging the Chinese economy. Some Republicans fear that Mr. Trump may settle for a deal that simply reduces the trade deficit between the two countries and potentially offers relief to a Chinese telecommunication giant, Huawei, which is facing criminal charges in the United States.
âItâs become a real concern that Democrats could use this against him in the 2020 election,â Michael Pillsbury, the director of Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute and a White House adviser, said of the dangers of Mr. Trump cutting a modest trade deal with China.
Mr. Trump has positioned his monthslong trade fight with China as necessary to win âthe biggest dealâ in history. China has agreed to make some changes to its trading relationship with America, including purchasing more soybeans and natural gas and preventing currency manipulation. The government has also committed to opening up financial services, insurance and car markets, changes the Chinese have previously discussed.
But many of the biggest sticking points still remain, including Chinaâs state subsidization of companies, which gives Chinese firms a competitive advantage. Beijing also still appears to be falling short of the administrationâs demands to stop what it says is a pattern of cybertheft and to end a requirement that American companies hand over valuable intellectual property as a condition of doing business there, people familiar with the negotiations said.
The Chinese are touting a clause in their investment law that would crack down on such transfers of technologies and offering up tougher regulations surrounding patents and copyrights, but some administration officials are skeptical that these changes will go far enough.
The Chinese Embassy released a statement through Chinaâs state news agency, Xinhua, on Monday, saying talks over the weekend were focused âon the text of an agreementâ and that the two sides would continue to push toward an agreement.
âThe Chinese delegation said that substantial progress was made on such specific issues as technology transfer, protection of intellectual property rights, non-tariff barriers, service industry, agriculture and exchange rates,â the statement said.
Top Democrats have focused on Mr. Trumpâs desire to reduce the bilateral trade deficit with China and are prepared to call any agreement that is based primarily on purchases of American soybeans, liquid natural gas and other farm products a failure.
âAt the heart of our economic challenges with China is its shirking of market economics, so it is troubling that Donald Trump may settle for a government commitment to buy U.S. agriculture as a means to let China off the hook,â said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.
Senior Republicans are also concerned that the president might soften on China. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, tweeted on Monday that Mr. Trump should not âtake a half deal as a good dealâ and urged the president to demand structural changes that are enforceable.
Democrats will have their first formal opportunity to confront the Trump administration directly on its China trade policy on Wednesday when Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Lighthizer, a longtime China hard-liner and the administrationâs top negotiator, is expected to face tough questioning from Democrats seeking assurances Mr. Trump will not accept a watered-down deal and declare victory.
âWith so many losses, Trump needs a win and any win will suffice â even one that is just Chinese promises of future purchases without meaningful, structural reform,â said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, who sits on the Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Trump has already started to signal his political concerns publicly. During a news conference this month at the White House, the president suggested that he would invite Democratic leaders to participate in negotiations with China so that they would not be able to undercut whatever agreement he reaches.
âAny deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, âOh, it shouldâve been better,ââ Mr. Trump said, referring to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. âThatâs called politics.â
An aide to Mr. Schumer said that no invitation has been offered.
Last week, Mr. Trump even embraced Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, on trade. The president said that Mr. Sanders, who is making his second presidential run as a Democrat, tends to agree with him on the issue and that Mr. Sanders is âtough on trade.â
While Mr. Sanders has praised some of Mr. Trumpâs moves on trade, he has also been critical of his negotiating approach in some cases, and has opposed the Trump administrationâs steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico and Europe.
Mr. Pillsbury said that Mr. Trumpâs campaign advisers have been gathering opposition research files on potential 2020 rivals and carefully taking note of what certain people, such as Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who is considering a run, have been saying about China.
Mr. Brown was one of three top Democrats â along with Mr. Schumer and Mr. Wyden â who sent a letter to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, this month urging the administration to âstay aggressiveâ and ensure that China commits to verifiable, enforceable reforms. The letter was sent after reports that Mr. Mnuchin wanted to scale back Chinese tariffs in advance of a deal.
âI will wait to judge the outcome of the trade talks until I know whatâs been agreed to,â Mr. Brown said in a statement. âBut itâs imperative that the White House secures an enforceable deal that includes long-term structural reforms to stop Chinaâs unfair trade practices and ensures American workers can compete on a level playing field.â
Officials from both countries have continued to be vague about the details of the progress, leading to speculation that China is just repackaging old promises as new concessions. China experts and business lobbyists say that the Chinese government has been carefully watching the shifting political dynamics in the United States, along with Mr. Trumpâs continuing legal turmoil, as it determines how to navigate the trade war in an environment with Democrats controlling more power in Washington.
In some cases, newly empowered Democrats have become an asset to the administrationâs China hawks, Mr. Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, who have been pressing Mr. Trump not to cut a modest deal and roll back tariffs to please Wall Street.
Mr. Schumer has long been critical of Chinaâs trade practices that have been harmful to the rural parts of New York State and he has been a vocal critic of Chinaâs history of currency manipulation. Speaker Nancy Pelosiâs return as the leader of the House of Representatives was also met with wariness in China. She has for years been outspoken about Chinaâs human rights record and has met on multiple occasions with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader vilified by China.
Because of that long history, Mr. Trumpâs advisers fear that Democrats in Congress will have more credibility when criticizing Mr. Trumpâs eventual China agreement even if it does not require congressional approval.
âThe Democrats are going to use this against him,â said Craig Allen, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council. âAs we go into the election cycle, it is natural and part of our national tradition that one side criticizes the other for China.â
Mr. Allen noted that political protest in the United States over China goes back to the countryâs inception, with the Boston Tea Party triggered by anger over imports of Chinese tea and that the anti-China sentiment tends to bubble up every four years. In 2012, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, then the Democratic majority leader, called for United States Olympic uniforms to be burned when it emerged that they were made in China.
There are also signs that Mr. Trump could face backlash from his own party if he is too conciliatory. During his meeting on Friday with a Chinese delegation in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump raised eyebrows among Republicans when he suggested that relief for Huawei, which has been charged with stealing intellectual property and impeding an investigation into the telecom companyâs attempt to evade economic sanctions on Iran, could be part of the trade deal.
After Mr. Trumpâs comment, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, tweeted that Huawei is a âserious national security threatâ and a âTrojan Horseâ for the Chinese Communist Party. And Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, dismissed a tweet by Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, for touting Chinaâs commitment to buy an extra 10 million metric tons of soybeans and said that any deal that allows China to keep âstealing trade secretsâ will not be a success.
The blowback from both directions may leave Mr. Trump little choice but to keep the threat of tariffs alive so that he can continue to claim heâs being tough on China, analysts said. In a January interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump acknowledged that some of the $250 billion worth of tariffs could be made permanent.
On Monday, as Mr. Trump headed to Hanoi, Vietnam, for a meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, he tweeted: âRelationship between our two Countries is very strong. I have therefore agreed to delay U.S. tariff hikes. Letâs see what happens?â

"China Shifts, and Detroitâs Big Bet Goes Sour","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245531343?accountid=14586,"CHONGQING, China â For Detroit, China once meant opportunity. The countryâs growing ranks of drivers bought cars by the millions. Its cheap labor gave American automakers dreams of someday exporting their Chinese-made cars to the United States. The Big Three bet billions of dollars there.
Now Chinaâs place in the world is shifting, and that bet is starting to sour.
Chinese consumers are buying fewer cars as the countryâs economy slows. Local competitors have raised their game. Many young people would rather use ride-sharing services similar to Uber than own vehicles themselves.
And if the Trump administrationâs trade hawks have their way, China wonât make many cars for Americans. As Washington and Beijing haggle over a deal to end their trade war, the hawks are defending tariffs, imposed by President Trump last year, that would make it expensive to sell Chinese-made cars â including those with American brands â in the United States.
Chinaâs slowdown presents the most immediate problem. Some of Detroitâs Chinese factories have slowed to a crawl. In the inland metropolis of Chongqing, where Ford builds cars like the compact Focus, three big assembly plants have been running at less than one-fifth of capacity. Fordâs joint venture in Chongqing has quietly begun dismissing thousands of its 20,000 workers.
Seven Zhou, a 32-year-old worker who assembled transmissions, lost his job last month. His paychecks had already shrunk by two-thirds because he was working fewer hours. He quit smoking to pay for food and rent, and the family is struggling to pay for the after-school English and math lessons his son needs for a chance at college.
âI do not have much education,â Mr. Zhou said. âI had hoped my child would not be like me, the bottom level of labor.â
As China transforms, many global businesses are struggling to adapt. Chinaâs economy has matured and can no longer match the sky-high growth rates of its go-go years. The Chinese government is trying to cope with all the debt accumulated to pay for that growth. Initiatives that could juice the economy have slowed.
The rest of the world has begun to fundamentally rethink its dependence on China to make much of what the world consumes. Some within the Trump administration see China as an existential threat to core American industries like autos, much as it has come to dominate production of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
There have long been doubts among automakers and consumers about whether cars made in China could measure up to those produced in America. But with the gap in quality narrowing, companies in China and the United States have begun to explore the possibility.
General Motors, which began exporting the Buick Envision from China to the United States in 2016, has been pleading since last summer without success for the Trump administration to exempt it from a 25 percent tariff imposed on Chinese-made cars. Ford announced in the summer of 2017 that it would move Focus production to China from Michigan, only to cancel those plans as the political landscape changed in the United States.
Exports from China to the United States of Detroit-brand cars are âa no-fly zone,â said Michael Dunne, the chief executive of ZoZo Go, an automotive consulting firm in San Diego. âItâs just too politically sensitive.â
Detroitâs fortunes in China could still improve. A final trade deal could leave the door open to Chinese exports. The Chinese government could take steps to rev up domestic growth or empower its consumers to buy cars.
âA stronger economy will lead to stronger auto sales,â said Irene Shen, a General Motors spokeswoman.
But for now, Detroitâs Big Three are struggling in China â particularly Ford.
Business from Detroit has helped China become both the worldâs largest maker and its largest buyer of cars. Much of the global auto parts industry has moved there as well, making it especially convenient to manufacture cars in China.
Drawn by the countryâs rapid development and consumer revolution, G.M. invested about $10 billion. It now makes and sells more cars through its Chinese joint ventures than it does in the United States. Ford, which came later, invested as much as $5 billion.
Chinaâs car-building capacity is now roughly equal to those of North America and Europe combined. More car factories are being built to meet regulatorsâ demands for more electric cars.
But a slowing economy and an end to tax breaks for car buyers have brought the industry back to earth. In January, car sales in China fell 18 percent from a year earlier. The average car factory in China, already operating at a little more than half capacity, has slowed even more amid the sales slump, according to LMC Automotive, a consulting firm.
American brands are also being squeezed. The Chinese elite still prefer premium German brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi. More frugal families buy cheaper Chinese and Japanese cars and are increasingly buying used.
The ride-hailing business has dealt automakers an unexpected blow. The global auto industry has worried for years that companies like Uber and Lyft could eat into demand, particularly among young customers. That appears to have happened in China, experts say, where dense urban cities have enhanced the appeal of Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing giant. Didi now carries twice as many riders in China each year as Uber carries in the rest of the world combined.
âNone of the multinational automakers foresaw how disruptive that would be to demand,â said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chryslerâs operations in China.
Young people in China are also more open to Chinese brands, thanks in part to their improved quality.
âTheyâre a lot more favorably disposed towards Chinese brands, and they have a pride in the Chinese brands,â said Nigel Harris, the president of Fordâs main joint venture in China, Changan Ford.
This winter has been difficult for American brands in China. Sales of G.M.âs Chevrolet and Buick models have faltered (though Cadillacs continue to sell well), and Chryslerâs Jeeps face stiff competition from cheaper sport utility vehicles made by Chinese companies. After a dismal autumn, Ford sold 70 percent fewer cars in China in January than it did in the same month a year earlier.
The automakers are tweaking their lineups to improve sales. G.M. and Ford are ramping up production of their respective Cadillac and Lincoln brands to tap the luxury market. G.M. has expanded its bargain Chinese brands, Baojun and Wuling. In a potentially risky move for its brand, Ford has put its blue oval logo on an inexpensive S.U.V., the Territory, that is mostly designed and built by a Chinese automaker, Jiangling Motors.
It is too early to tell how well Fordâs move will go. But at a Ford dealership in Chongqing, the $16,000 Territory was selling briskly, while a number of Focus cars, priced at $22,000, have sat unsold since 2017.
âAs soon as one arrives,â Li Pengfei, a salesman, said of the Territory, âsomeone picks it up.â
Nowhere are the problems of Detroit automakers more apparent than in Chongqing, an often foggy city built on steep slopes overlooking the confluence of two broad, muddy rivers, the Yangtze and the Jialing.
When a local hiring hall held an automotive-themed day last week, it was mobbed with former Ford employees who had accepted severance payments and were looking for their next jobs. The company has changed from running factories on up to three shifts, almost around the clock, to just a single shift.
Mr. Harris declined to discuss layoffs in detail, saying, âOrganizational fitness is a critical part of China cost, so we are working night and day to make sure that we are fit.â
In Chongqing, some workers do not see the industry ever recovering.
Du Wen, a 28-year-old in a green hoodie and jeans who had assembled car doors for Fordâs joint venture partner, Changan, for the past four years, said that he was going to leave the auto industry entirely. So he was applying to work at a factory making instant soup, even though that would mean a sharp pay cut.
âEveryone needs to eat,â he said, âeven when the economy slows down.â

Will Trump Trade the Future for a Hill of Beans?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245494236?accountid=14586,"Itâs easy to sell soybeans to China. The Chinese are voracious consumers of the worldâs raw materials. Until 2018, shiploads of soybeans from the American Midwest streamed to the processing plants that dot the Chinese coast. So there is no reason to applaud the news that the Chinese government has offered to guarantee large purchases of American soybeans as part of a potential trade deal with the United States that the Trump administration is pushing to complete by late March or early April.
Instead, it is a worrying sign that the administration may settle for an ephemeral victory at the expense of Americaâs long-term economic interests.
President Trump, by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, created an opportunity to improve Americaâs economic relationship with China. It is a chance that may not come again. The American economy is strong, while the Chinese economy is faltering. China still needs American technologies. And despite Mr. Trumpâs distaste for multilateralism, much of the rest of the world shares his concerns about Chinaâs economic policies and trade practices.
His decision to go it alone, rather than making common cause with longstanding allies, was ill advised, and his tit-for-tat trade war has caused significant pain for many Americans. Farmers and other American exporters lost access to an important market; consumers are paying higher prices on a wide range of goods.
But Mr. Trump was right to argue that China has engaged in unfair competition. The question is whether he can win significant concessions.
The proper measure of any deal is whether it achieves Mr. Trumpâs stated purpose in starting this trade war: persuading China to curb its use of state subsidies, regulations and various kinds of informal interference that limit the ability of American companies to sell goods and services in China, and help Chinese companies sell goods in the United States.
Measured as a share of Chinese gross domestic product, imports of American manufactured products have fallen by more than half since 2000, according to calculations by Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations. One reason is that China aggressively subsidizes the creation of homegrown alternatives. To take a noteworthy example, a government-owned company, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, is developing a single-aisle passenger jet, the C919. The airplane is intended to reduce Chinaâs spending on Boeing 737s â and to create a new rival for Boeing in the global market.
Chinaâs lax enforcement of its environmental and labor laws also amounts to a significant subsidy for Chinese manufacturing, and an inducement to relocate American jobs to China.
Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trumpâs lead trade negotiator, has said the administration expects to make progress on these issues. But the United States has focused its demands on making it easier for American companies to operate in China, including protections for intellectual property and more leeway for foreign financial firms. China has accelerated work on a foreign investment law that would codify some of those changes, including a ban on the practice of requiring foreign companies to share proprietary technologies with the Chinese.
American corporate expansion in China would benefit shareholders and executives. But it would not create factory jobs for American workers, Mr. Trumpâs stated goal.
Whatâs more, any promises the administration secures from China require an effective enforcement mechanism. The United States has failed in past efforts to hold China to its commitments through the World Trade Organization and through bilateral talks.
The United States also is seeking an enforceable agreement to prevent exchange rate manipulation. China accelerated its development by saving rather than spending much of what it earned from exports to the United States. This suppressed the value of its currency, making its exports relatively cheap and American imports relatively expensive. The failure of previous administrations to hold China to account on this front has passed beyond remedy, and China is no longer engaged in currency manipulation, at least as defined under American law. But a framework to monitor and address manipulation could deter future shenanigans. And other countries continue to engage in currency manipulation at the expense of the United States, so an effective deal with China could serve as a constructive precedent.
The looming risk, however, is that Mr. Trump will accept a deal that allows him to claim a superficial triumph without forcing China to make enduring changes.
In particular, the United States should reject any Chinese offer to guarantee large-scale purchases of American agricultural products like soybeans or energy products like liquid natural gas â indeed, guaranteed purchases of any kind.
Such deals could serve Mr. Trumpâs desire to reduce Americaâs annual trade deficit with China. But the achievement would be purely cosmetic. The overall balance of Americaâs imports and exports is important; the balance with any particular country is not.
Past administrations have rejected similar offers from China because they run counter to Americaâs longstanding goal of reducing the Chinese governmentâs heavy-handed management of the countryâs economy.
They would also come at the expense of Americaâs allies. If China buys more soybeans from North Dakota, it would buy fewer from Brazil. An international consensus that Chinaâs trade policies are problematic has increased pressure on China to make meaningful concessions. Maintaining a unified front would help to ensure that China honors its commitments. Grabbing market share is unlikely to further that objective.
Mr. Lighthizer has argued, correctly, that any agreement with China is a step in a long-term process. The United States should not strike a deal that undermines those long-term goals in exchange for ephemeral gains.

Chinaâs Brutal âBoarding Schoolsâ,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245487479?accountid=14586,"The Trump administration may not be the most unimpeachable source when it comes to human rights, but the head of the State Departmentâs bureau for human rights, Michael Kozak, was dead on when he said Chinaâs mass incarceration of Muslim minorities was âjust remarkably awful.â
Mr. Kozak made the comments on Wednesday as the State Department presented its annual report on human rights around the world, an event at which his boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, declared that China was âin a league of its own when it comes to human rights violations.â
Thatâs a tough call in todayâs world. But Chinaâs brutal campaign to strip Uighur and other Turkic minorities in the Xinjiang region of their culture, religion and identity through a network of secretive re-education camps must rank among the more outrageous continuing violations in the world. What makes it all the more galling is the Beijing governmentâs feigned umbrage whenever the camps are mentioned, and its absurd efforts to depict them as Chinaâs contribution to the war on terrorism.
After initially denying the existence of the camps, China in October began a campaign to portray them as âcampuses,â âvocational training centersâ and âboarding schoolsâ intended to bring Uighurs into the modern era.
China has made direct news reporting from Xinjiang all but impossible, giving access only to carefully monitored official tours. On one, Reuters reported that camp inmates praised their new life and sang, in English, âIf youâre happy and you know it, clap your hands.â
Reports from survivors, Uighur dissidents, the Uighur diaspora, satellite imagery and other sources depict something far more akin to the gulag than a happy boarding school, with at least 120,000 and possibly more than a million Uighurs, out of a population of more than 10 million Muslims in Xinjiang, forced to undergo Cultural Revolution-style coercion to adopt state-sanctioned norms of political thought and behavior.
Writing in The Times, Mustafa Akyol, a senior fellow on Islam at the Cato Institute, described camps at which âpeople are forced to listen to ideological lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write âself-criticismâ essays.â He said survivors told of sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, beatings and torture.
Conquered and incorporated into China in the 18th century, Xinjiang has long been a thorn in Chinaâs side. The Chinese government attributes scores of violent events, including bombings and assassinations, to Uighur separatists. Violent riots in July 2009 in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital, escalated into attacks on Han Chinese people and a vicious crackdown and several death sentences.
But trying to extinguish national identity through what amounts to mass brainwashing is an atrocity that smacks of some of the worst experiments of our time â including Chinaâs own Cultural Revolution â with some thoroughly modern twists. A key part of Chinaâs campaign to control the Uighurs has been collecting DNA from members of the minority under the guise of a free health check.
Sadly, Muslim nations have been reticent about supporting the Uighurs, possibly because of the economic clout China wields among them and the solidarity some of these states have with an anti-Western authoritarian regime. In February, Saudi Arabiaâs Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was quoted on Chinese television after a meeting with President Xi Jinping as saying, âChina has the right to carry out antiterrorism and de-extremization work for its national security.â
That should not dissuade other governments and organizations from continuing to focus attention on the camps, as the State Department has. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress, the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, would require the State Department and intelligence agencies to report on what the Chinese government is doing in Xinjiang. The bill should be promptly passed. The United States should also support the request of 15 Western ambassadors to Beijing â Americaâs was not one of them â to meet with the Communist Party secretary in Xinjiang.
What is happening in Xinjiang must not be ignored.

19th-Century âHumiliationâ Haunts China-U.S. Trade Talks,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245443199?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â When President Trumpâs trade team presented Chinese officials with a list of bold economic demands in Beijing last May, one of Chinaâs state-controlled news outlets, Global Times, panned the request and blared a curious headline: âIs it now 1840?â
Five months later, Chinaâs national news agency, Xinhua, accused Vice President Mike Pence of lacking knowledge of Chinaâs past after he complained that Beijing was merely paying lip service to opening its economy.
Behind the pushback is a long and painful history of China surrendering to Western powers, with origins in what the Chinese news media refers to as a âcentury of humiliationâ that began with the âunequal treatiesâ of the 19th century after the first Opium War.
History has been haunting trade negotiations between the worldâs two largest economies, which have dragged on for more than a year. While the administrationâs requests surrounding forced technology transfer and subsidies of state-owned enterprises remain unresolved, the deepest division centers on the United Statesâ insistence of an enforcement mechanism that gives it power to impose tariffs if China abrogates its end of a trade agreement.
That issue is expected to be front and center on Thursday, when Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trumpâs top trade negotiator, will again try to make headway toward a final deal during a two-day visit to Beijing. Next week, a delegation of government officials from China is scheduled to come to Washington for additional talks.
As they work to agree on trade terms, Trump administration officials have outlined various situations for enforcing an agreement. Most recently, negotiators have called for a system in which representatives from both countries would meet to address problems that arise, escalating complaints to the top levels of government as necessary.
The Chinese have agreed to periodic meetings at the levels of office director, vice minister and minister, which would allow the United States to keep tabs on Chinaâs behavior and air complaints from companies about unfair business practices. If China fails to keep its agreement, the United States would respond âproportionally but unilaterally,â Mr. Lighthizer said at a congressional hearing last month.
Republican lawmakers, who have been closely tracking the negotiations, say they expect enforcement to be a determining factor in whether a deal is reached.
âWhat we want is the ability to put on unilateral tariffs that canât be counteracted by a tariff from China,â Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters on Wednesday.
While Mr. Grassley said he was not sure whether such a request was a reasonable one to make, he said it was the goal of the Trump administration.
âWeâve got to have enforcement, one way or the other,â he said, adding that China had a history of breaking promises on trade.
But China is resisting the Trump administrationâs demand that the United States be allowed to impose tariffs if Beijing fails to keep its promises and that China agree not to retaliate with its own punitive measures.
The Trump administration says such a mechanism is necessary to ensure that China lives up to its agreement and does not repeat what it says is a pattern of reneging on past promises. But such disarmament has proved to be unpalatable in China, in part, historians say, because of stinging memories of one-sided treaties from an earlier era.
âEvery schoolchild in China and every educated Chinese person knows about the âcentury of humiliation,ââ said Stephen R. Platt, a historian and author of âImperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of Chinaâs Last Golden Age.â âThereâs a lingering memory of that history from the 19th century that goes a long way to explain the desire in China for a global trading order that works more on Chinaâs terms.â
He added, âThey have to look strong on trade.â
In 1839, the big trade war that gripped the world was between Britain and Chinaâs Qing dynasty. Britain was buying large quantities of Chinese silk and tea, but China was buying little in return, creating an uncomfortably large trade deficit. So Britain turned to smuggling Indian opium, a product that proved hard to resist, into China, and its resistance turned a trade war into a real one.
The three-year war ended with the Treaty of Nanking, which gave Britain control of Hong Kong and opened several new trade ports in China. British merchants were allowed to come to China and trade freely with no restrictions.
That was just the beginning. By the 1850s, the United States, Russia and France signed treaties with China with the same terms, allowing foreigners to sell goods with low tariffs and giving them privileged status in mainland China. Rather than show respect for the superiority of Chinese culture, China was forced to adhere to the traditions of Western diplomacy. The influx of foreign culture reoriented Chinaâs economy, eventually leading to the dynastyâs downfall in 1912.
Some historians, such as William C. Kirby, a professor of Chinese studies at Harvard Business School, argue that the unequal treaties did have benefits for China such as modernizing its institutions and its education system. However, that does not always mean that trade pacts are mutually beneficial.
âOne should always be cautious that what is good for you, you imagine is good for the other party automatically,â Mr. Kirby said. âIt might be, it might not be.â
Trump administration officials have tried to make the case that the changes it wants China to make will benefit everyone.
âThe kinds of things that weâre asking for are not anti-Chinese at all,â Mr. Lighthizer told NPR this week. âIn fact, the reformers would say itâs pro-Chinese. It will help their economy, not hurt their economy.â
Despite suggesting that their interests are aligned, it has been difficult for the United States to push China to make changes without coming across as bullying or insensitive. After talks stalled in February, Larry Kudlow, the director of the White Houseâs National Economic Council, said that Mr. Lighthizer read the âriot actâ to Liu He, Chinaâs vice premier and the countryâs top trade negotiator.
It has also been hard for the Trump administration to sell the agreement as being two-sided. Mr. Trump has accused China of essentially stealing from the United States for decades and his administration is demanding that China buy more American goods, stop subsidizing its own companies and treat foreign companies fairly. In return, the United States has so far offered to remove some, but not all, of the $250 billion worth of tariffs Mr. Trump imposed last year.
âI consider that weâve rebuilt China,â Mr. Trump said last week at an event in Ohio. â$500 billion a year taken out of our country,â he said, referring to the amount of Chinese goods imported into the United States.
China remains skeptical that many of the concessions that Mr. Trump is asking for will really help uplift its economy.
While old memories of humiliation might still be fresh in Chinaâs collective mind, its status in the world has changed drastically in the last 150 years. Now the worldâs second-largest economy, China has been exerting its own influence around the world.
Development programs like Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure investment plan, have drawn criticism from the United States and in parts of Europe for being insufficiently transparent and putting more vulnerable economies in precarious positions.
âChinese policy has shifted from fear of being bullied into unequal treaties into becoming a bully itself and forcing unequal agreements on weaker nations,â said Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration.
But, Mr. Pillsbury points out, the Chinese do not see things that way when it comes to a trade deal with the United States. The Communist Party was founded nearly a century ago on a promise of putting a stop to humiliation at the hands of foreigners.
âThe Communist Party was created on a narrative of standing up to, and ending, unequal treaties,â he said.

Italyâs Deal With China Signals a Shift as U.S. Influence Recedes,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245414631?accountid=14586,"ROME â For decades, Italy felt the brunt of the Chinese economic juggernaut that the United States argues poses a threat to the financial and political future of the West.
Chinaâs government-backed manufacturers, operating on a much larger scale with much cheaper costs, devoured small Italian companies producing machinery, textiles and pharmaceuticals. Chinese knockoffs infuriated its high-fashion brands.
But this month, as the United States continued to engage in a trade standoff with China, and leaders of the European Union banded together to demand an end to unfair Chinese business practices, Italy took another route â Chinaâs new Silk Road.
In a move that signaled geopolitical shifts from West to East, Italy broke with its European and American allies during last weekâs visit by President Xi Jinping of China, and became the first member of the Group of 7 major economies to officially sign up to Chinaâs vast new One Belt One Road global infrastructure project.
âThis is not being isolated from Europe, this is Italy leading,â Michele Geraci, Italyâs under secretary for economic development, and the driving force behind the deal, said in a telephone interview from Chinaâs southern Hainan province.
âAnd when you lead,â he added, âyou do need to be alone for a split second. But this bit is going to be very short.â
Italyâs transactional tradition in trade and foreign policy, its anti-establishment governmentâs antagonism toward the European Union, the failure of the United States to intervene effectively and Chinaâs expertise in exploiting political dysfunction â all of those things contributed to the making of the deal.
So, too, did Italyâs desperation for investment, access to Chinaâs enormous markets and anything resembling an economic uptick.
But Italyâs keen sense of history and awareness to the shifts of great powers also may have had something to do with it.
While the United States has been a close ally since World War II and is home to an enormous Italian diaspora, Italy is no stranger to China.
Ancient Romans prized Chinese silk and the Chinese valued Roman glass. Marco Polo captivated the West with his turn-of-the-14th-century tales of trading with the wealthy East, and the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci produced a map of the world in Chinese characters that revealed European exploration to East Asia.
Now as the United States has withdrawn from the world, China is front and center on Italyâs map again.
This week, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said that as China exerts a stronger influence on the worldâs economy, it is going to exert âan increasing influence also at the political level.â
Mr. Conte was speaking at an event in Rome held by a Jesuit magazine to discuss the Vaticanâs own breakthrough deal last year with China, in which Pope Francis made concessions to the Chinese government in order to bring all the Chinese bishops into communion with Rome, and to gain more access to the worldâs most populous country.
In front of an audience of top diplomats, prelates and government officials, all eager to learn more about China, Mr. Conte spoke admiringly of Chinaâs efforts to become a world leader in âtechnology and in innovation, leadership that we know is very contested by the United States.â
The United States, in fact, sought to stop Italyâs joining of the Silk Road.
This week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was âsaddenedâ by the development. On Thursday, Luigi Di Maio, Italyâs deputy prime minister and the political leader of the Five Star Movement, met with National Security Adviser John R. Bolton at the White House.
Mr. Di Maio told reporters that he assured the Americans that the China deal was purely about commerce and that Italy remained firmly in the political orbit of the United States, which has vastly more money invested in the country than China does.
In the months before the deal, Mr. Di Maio repeatedly visited China, and nearly made a deal in November, Italian officials said. All along, the Italians said, they heard barely a peep from top officials in the United States, and by the time Mr. Boltonâs spokesman went public against the deal earlier this month, it was too late.
A senior government official, speaking on background to discuss internal deliberations, said Washington would have engaged sooner if it had understood that Italy planned to officially join the new Silk Road, which it sees as a strategic threat.
The official said the chaotic nature of Italian politics and the fact that visits to Beijing had become the norm for European leaders made it harder to discern what the Italians were up to.
Indeed, already 16 central and eastern European countries, including 11 members of the European Union, have formal business relations with China.
The Chinese have essentially bought the port of Piraeus, outside Athens. The new deal will now also allow it access to critical Italian ports, like Genoa and another in Trieste, which has a rail link reaching right into the heart of Central Europe.
This month, Mayor Roberto Dipiazza of Trieste looked out his window at a cruise ship that was to set sail for China, following the route of Marco Polo. He said that despite the American criticism, âif the Chinese come it is a great opportunity for development, for work, not only for my city, but for my country, for an important part of Europe.â
Not everyone agrees.
As Mr. Xi arrived in Italy, Mr. Macron of France made a show of strength against Chinaâs aggressive business practices by presenting a united European front against China. He then invited Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to join him for his meeting in Paris with Mr. Xi.
But it was hardly a rude welcome. Ms. Merkel, Chinaâs largest trading partner in Europe, seemed open to the prospect of Europe participating more with China, if they evened the playing field.
âWe, as Europeans, want to play an active part,â in the new Silk Road project she said after the talks.
France, which is trying to increase its market share in China, announced that it was selling 300 new airplanes to the Chinese and cut billions more euros in other deals, ranging from the export of French chickens to agreements between French and Chinese companies on power grids and ship building.
More than a brush back to the Chinese, the meeting with Mr. Xi â who said âa united and prosperous Europe corresponds to our vision of a multipolar worldâ â seemed to be a turn away from the United States.
âThe order of things has been shaken,â the French president said, suggesting the Trump administrationâs withdrawal from multilateral agreements had pushed France and China closer together.
The American officials said there was a large difference between bilateral trade deals with China, which every country, including the United States, had a right to pursue, and signing up to the Silk Road, which gave China a propaganda boost that it used to seek more economic gains through unfair business practices.
Mr. Geraci didnât see the difference. He said France was âdoing the exact same things that we are doing,â and noted that France and Germany did vastly more business with China than Italy did.
âOnce the first domino topples,â he said of Italyâs decision, âthe others will follow.â
Already, China has made incursions that have caused deep anxiety in Washington, especially when it comes to use of 5G wireless networks developed by the Chinese electronics giant Huawei.
Washington has warned that the networks could be used by Beijing to spy on communications networks. This week, Britain released a report critical of the security vulnerabilities presented by Huawei. But other European countries are less worried.
When Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany, threatened that the United States would scale back its intelligence sharing with Berlin if Huawei played a role in its 5G infrastructure, Ms. Merkel shot him down. âWe are defining our standards for ourselves,â she said.
Mr. Geraci noted that next year would mark the moment when Asia overtook the rest of the globe as the worldâs biggest economy.
It would also, he said, be the 50th anniversary of Italyâs establishing diplomatic relations with China, a move the United States was also highly critical of at the time.
China was rising, Mr. Geraci said. âWe cannot stop it.â

China Purchases Could Undercut Trumpâs Larger Trade Goal,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245413746?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â At the heart of President Trumpâs negotiations with China is a troubling contradiction: The United States wants to use the trade talks to encourage the country to adopt a more market-oriented economy. But a key element of a prospective deal may end up reinforcing the economic power of the Chinese state.
Negotiators are still working out deal terms, but any agreement seems certain to involve Chinaâs promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods. For Mr. Trump, this is an essential element that will help reduce the United Statesâ record trade deficit with China and bolster farmers and other constituencies hurt by his trade war.
But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state, and most will be carried out by state-controlled Chinese businesses, further cementing Beijingâs role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese.
âIt seems like those types of really simplistic purchasing commitment type of arrangements would actually reinforce state ownership rather than discourage it,â said Rufus Yerxa, the head of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents the United Statesâ largest exporters.
After months of talks, the two sides are inching closer to an agreement. Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trumpâs top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, discussed the remaining sticking points with their Chinese counterparts on Thursday evening and Friday in Beijing. Mr. Mnuchin wrote on Twitter on Friday that the talks had been âconstructive.â
Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by this week, to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He, the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal, who will begin meeting with his American counterparts on Wednesday.
The United States and China had been looking to reach a tentative agreement by the end of Mr. Liuâs visit, with a signing ceremony between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China potentially later this month.
But the two sides are still wrestling with two major sticking points: how an agreement will be monitored and enforced and how many of Mr. Trumpâs tariffs come off and when, said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Brilliant said there was no question the United States and China were âin the endgame with regard to a deal.â However, he said these factors were âcomplicating the fact that the agreement is 90 percent done at this point.â
To pave the way toward an agreement, China made several announcements that could benefit American companies. Last week, Chinese regulators approved JPMorgan Chaseâs request to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country, a change China had discussed since entering the World Trade Organization two decades ago. Chinese officials have also floated the idea of an expanded trial that would allow foreign cloud computing companies to operate more freely.
On Sunday evening, Chinaâs Finance Ministry issued two statements saying that Beijing would continue to suspend tariffs it imposed last year on American cars and car parts in retaliation for Mr. Trumpâs tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. Those tariffs, which were suspended while the two sides tried to reach an agreement, were supposed to resume at the end of March, but China said it would extend the suspension indefinitely as a gesture of good will.
The Finance Ministry said, âWe hope that the U.S. and China will work together to step up consultations and make practical efforts toward the goal of ending trade friction.â
While the two sides are closer to an agreement than at any point in the past, it remains unclear how successful the Trump administration will be in achieving its key goals. The presidentâs trade war was initiated in large part to try to reorient the Chinese economy and force it to become more open to American companies and investment. Using punishing tariffs as leverage, the Trump administration has pressed China to roll back its heavy hand in the economy, including asking Beijing to curtail subsidies to state-owned firms and to end its practice of forcing foreign companies doing business in China to transfer their technology to Chinese competitors.
China has not readily committed to these goals, in part because such commitments are seen as infringing on Chinaâs sovereignty and undercutting the power of the Chinese state. What the Chinese have agreed to most readily is purchasing American goods, especially commodities that can fuel their economy.
While the final list could be different, the United States and China have discussed the purchase of products including corn, soybeans, sorghum, natural gas, oil, coal, chemicals, semiconductors and airplanes, according to people with knowledge of the talks.
The Trump administration views these purchases as necessary to bolster the presidentâs support across farming and manufacturing communities hard hit by the trade war and to help narrow the gap between what China sells to the United States and what it buys. The administration has been working on various draft lists of what it wants China to purchase, according to people who have viewed them.
The final purchasing amount is not yet clear. In December, Mr. Mnuchin said that China had made an offer to buy more than $1.2 trillion in American goods as part of the talks. But economists and China analysts have cautioned that such a large amount could be hard for the United States to produce and export.
The United States exported just $120 billion of goods to China last year. With the American economy hovering near full employment, it lacks the productive capacity to raise exports by hundreds of billions of dollars in the short term. The United States could redirect some of the goods it sells to other countries to China instead, for instance diverting soybeans headed to Europe to China.
But a deal that would require China to buy even more from the United States is raising concerns that China could expand its leverage over the United States.
âIf it can be negotiated by government fiat, it can be taken away by government fiat,â said Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, an energy-focused research firm.
The deal could usher in a wave of new American exports if China agrees to open its markets more fully. Removing its requirements that American carmakers and financial services firms team up with a Chinese entity to do business in the country, for instance, could give those firms more ability to sell goods and services to China.
But in other industries, including agriculture, energy and aviation, purchases associated with a trade deal would be made directly by state-controlled entities. And while that would mean greater revenues for American companies, skeptics say it could also increase the leverage that China has over the United States in the future.
âWe are handing them the ability to coerce our companies,â said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
Such a purchasing arrangement could also provoke challenges at the World Trade Organization, which bars its members from granting special advantages or privileges to any one country, as well as directing state enterprises to purchase goods from a specific country.
China has already demonstrated its ability to influence commodity purchases depending on the tenor of relations, analysts said. Once trade tensions flared, China drove its purchases of American oil to nearly zero last year, Mr. Book said. After a breakthrough in talks this year, China ramped up its purchases of United States soybeans.
âHow easy would it be for the government of China to then turn off that tap when it gets into a dispute with the U.S.?â Mr. Yerxa asked.
Recent events have also raised a question over some components of the purchasing package under discussion. China had planned to buy Boeing 737 Max series planes. But the crash of a 737 Max in Ethiopia in early March, the second deadly crash of the new plane in less than five months, has thrown those plans into question.
Last week, China suspended the airworthiness certification for the model entirely, a move Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, described as âpretty aggressive.â
âI think thereâs a very good chance that this is less about public safety and more about trade negotiation leverage,â Mr. Aboulafia said.
Itâs also unclear how many purchases of semiconductors, the advanced components that power circuits in laptops, smartphones and other electronics, will ultimately be in the deal.
While China would like to buy more of the advanced technology, the Trump administration is concerned about allowing Beijing to gain an upper hand in the next generation of technology. The administration has pushed China to roll back its Made in China 2025 campaign, an industrial plan that pumps state money into building cutting-edge industries, like advanced manufacturing and aviation.
China had proposed last year to purchase $200 billion of American semiconductors, according to people with knowledge of the deal. Beijing wanted to buy the semiconductors straight from fabrication lines at American factories and then do the necessary packaging and testing in China. The United States rejected that idea. The two sides have since discussed a smaller number, but it is not clear now how many semiconductor purchases will ultimately be included in a deal.
The semiconductor industry has publicly warned that additional purchases could result in the Chinese governmentâs gaining more power to control where Chinese companies buy products. While Chinese companies may buy more American components in the short term, the industry warns that Beijing could ultimately use such a system to redirect purchases to Chinese suppliers instead.
For now, administration officials are still trying to assure lawmakers that their trade deal will achieve the economic changes the United States wants and will require much more than purchases.
When pressed by lawmakers in February about whether the deal would require more than just additional sales to China, Mr. Lighthizer told Congress: âI do not think it should just be a purchase agreement.â

One Trump Victory: Companies Rethink China,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245413597?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â Whatever deal Washington and Beijing reach over the trade war, President Trump has already scored a big victory: Companies are rethinking their reliance on China.
The two sides are nearing an agreement, with Mr. Trump saying on Thursday that an âepicâ trade pact could be weeks away and that he may soon meet with President Xi Jinping, Chinaâs top leader. But already, spurred by tariffs and trade tensions, global companies are beginning to shift their supply chains away from China, just as some Trump administration officials had wanted.
The move, known as decoupling, is a major goal of those who believe the world has grown far too dependent on China as a manufacturing giant. As Beijing builds up its military and extends its geopolitical influence, some officials fear that Americaâs dependence on Chinese factories makes it strategically vulnerable.
Now companies in a number of industries are reducing their exposure to China. GoPro, the mobile camera maker, and Universal Electronics, which makes sensors and remote controls, are shifting some work to Mexico. Hasbro is moving its toy making to the United States, Mexico, Vietnam and India. Aten International, a Taiwanese computer equipment company, brought work back to Taiwan. Danfoss, a Danish conglomerate, is changing the production of heating and hydraulic equipment to the United States.
Mr. Trumpâs victory in this department is not unalloyed. Despite his promises to bring jobs back to the United States, most of the work is shifting to other countries with lower costs. Reshaping global supply chains also takes time, and China will remain a vital manufacturing hub for decades to come.
Still, chief executives say the trade war has prompted a fundamental reassessment of China as the dominant place to make things. Even Chinese companies are expanding overseas, although they still have most of their production in China.
âChina was the factory of the world,â said Song Zhiping, the Communist Party chief at the China National Building Materials Group, a state-owned giant. âThings are changing. Thatâs why Chinese companies are going out of China.â
A spokeswoman for the United States trade representativeâs office declined to comment.
While Mr. Trump portrays his trade fight as a clash over jobs, proponents of decoupling within the administration see the effort as a way of contending with a stronger, more aggressive China.
Already, China dominates the market for items like solar panels, and has emerged as the worldâs largest producer of cars, car parts and many other sophisticated products. It plans to build jetliners, advanced computer chips, electric cars and other goods of the future.
Any deal is likely to leave in place new American tariffs on cars, aircraft parts, equipment for nuclear power plants and other items that administration officials see as essential for economic and security reasons. But more broadly, the trade hawks hope companies in other industries will also find friendlier countries in which to do business.
China emerged as a manufacturing powerhouse over the past two decades. The work force was low cost and relatively skilled. The Communist Party prevented the emergence of independent labor unions. Subcontractors abounded, meaning companies could strongly negotiate for lower supply costs. China built an extensive network of highways and rail lines. It has a vast and growing local customer base, meaning companies donât have to go far to sell their products.
Businesses flocked there. China accounted for one-quarter of the worldâs manufacturing by value last year, up from 8 percent in 2000, according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.
The value created in China by manufacturing last year was bigger than in the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.
But wages and other costs in China have been rising for years. A growing number of businesses complain that Chinese officials too often favor local competitors or donât do enough to stop intellectual property theft.
The prospect of more trade fights only adds to the reasons to diversify, which also include threats elsewhere like Mr. Trumpâs threat to close the border with Mexico and Britainâs troubled exit from the European Union.
âLocalization will matter more,â Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, one of Germanyâs largest conglomerates, said in an interview late last month on the sidelines of the China Development Forum in Beijing. âYouâre more resilient to political discussions.â
China may not necessarily oppose some of the efforts to decouple. Beijing has long hoped to shed low-skilled, polluting manufacturing jobs and move higher up the value chain.
âThe total size of the work force is falling, the labor cost is rising and we are losing our competitive advantage in low-cost industries,â Miao Wei, Chinaâs minister of industry and information technology, said at the China Development Forum. He added that the country would focus instead on high-tech, innovative industries.
Still, Chinese officials must walk a fine line. As the countryâs economy slows, an abrupt shift of work out of China could lead to job losses and instability.
Decoupling efforts appear to be in their early stages. A broad survey by UBS of chief financial officers at export-oriented manufacturers in China late last year found that a third had moved at least some production out of China in 2018. Another third intended to do so this year. The typical company was moving the production for about 30 percent of its exports, UBS found.
Companies now want to depend less on one place, which means looking for an alternative to China, Bill Winters, the chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year.
âPeople who are concerned at the prospect of greater tariffs on Chinese exports, for example, are looking to move export facilities from China to other countries, including Chinese companies,â Mr. Winters said.
Countries seeking to displace China have begun pointing out that exports from their countries are less likely to face tariffs.
For companies with operations in China, âthe trade war between the United States and China creates a new uncertainty,â Airlangga Hartarto, Indonesiaâs minister of industry, said in an interview in Davos.
The ability to diversify depends on the industry. Some auto parts companies have run their American factories more hours each day to avoid tariffs on Chinese-made goods, said Razat Gaurav, the chief executive of LLamasoft, a supply chain management company in Ann Arbor, Mich.
By contrast, he said, manufacturers of smartphones and smartphone components â which have generally not been hit by Mr. Trumpâs tariffs â have found few places to move work because China dominates that supply chain. Still, some in that industry are shifting too, such as Sonyâs closure of a Beijing smartphone factory last month after expanding production in Thailand.
For now, companies are looking for alternatives. Steve Madden, the shoe company, is moving production to Cambodia. Hasbro, the worldâs leading toymaker, has a goal for the end of next year âto be 60 percent out of China,â by shifting production to the United States and elsewhere, Brian Goldner, the companyâs chairman and chief executive, said in a recent conference call.
Though much of the work leaving China is going to other low-cost countries, some companies are following Mr. Trumpâs suggestion that they move production to the United States.
Danfoss, a Danish maker of heating and cooling systems as well as sensors and transmitters, has seen rising costs in China, especially for skilled labor, said Kim Fausing, the companyâs chief executive and president. It is also looking for ways to reduce transportation-related emissions of global warming gases.
When Danfoss bought an American heating systems company a year ago and found that the company had recently shifted some work to China, it acted quickly. âThe first thing we did after we acquired it was we moved everything backâ to the United States, where Danfoss already had a dozen factories, Mr. Fausing said.
The first round of 25 percent tariffs that Mr. Trump put in place last July included hydraulic parts long manufactured by Danfoss in northeastern China. The company transferred production of these parts to the United States as well.
âThere is not much of a difference between the costs in China and the United States,â Mr. Fausing said. âYou have to have a very good case today to justify producing something in China and shipping it to the U.S.â

"Th e Hottest App in China Teaches Citizens About Their Leader â and, Yes, Thereâs a Test","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245407875?accountid=14586,"CHANGSHA, China â Inside a fishing gear store on a busy city street, the owner sits behind a counter, furiously tapping a smartphone to improve his score on an app that has nothing to do with rods, reels and bait.
The owner, Jiang Shuiqiu, a 35-year-old army veteran, has a different obsession: earning points on Study the Great Nation, a new app devoted to promoting President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party â a kind of high-tech equivalent of Maoâs Little Red Book. Mr. Jiang spends several hours daily on the app, checking news about Mr. Xi and brushing up on socialist theories.
Tens of millions of Chinese workers, students and civil servants are now using Study the Great Nation, often under pressure from the government. It is part of a sweeping effort by Mr. Xi to strengthen ideological control in the digital age and reassert the partyâs primacy, as Mao once did, as the center of Chinese life.
âWe must love our country,â said Mr. Jiang, one of the top scorers on the app in Changsha, the capital of the southern province of Hunan. âWe are getting stronger and stronger.â
While many people have embraced the app as a form of patriotism, others see it as a burden imposed by overzealous officials and another sign of a growing personality cult around Mr. Xi, perhaps Chinaâs most powerful leader since Maoâs time.
âHe is using new media to fortify loyalty toward him,â said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing. He likened Study the Great Nation to the little booklet of Mao quotations that was widely circulated during the chaotic and violent Cultural Revolution.
Since its debut this year, Study the Great Nation has become the most downloaded app on Appleâs digital storefront in China, with the state news media saying it has more than 100 million registered users â a reach that would be the envy of any new appâs creators.
But those numbers are driven largely by the party, which ordered thousands of officials across China to ensure that the app penetrates the daily routines of as many citizens as possible, whether they like it or not.
Schools are shaming students with low app scores. Government offices are holding study sessions and forcing workers who fall behind to write reports criticizing themselves. Private companies, hoping to curry favor with party officials, are ranking employees based on their use of the app and awarding top performers the title of âstar learner.â
Many employers now require workers to submit daily screenshots documenting how many points they have earned.
Propaganda is ubiquitous in China, but experts say Study the Great Nation is different because the government is forcing people to use it and punishing those who cheat or fall behind.
The app allows users to earn points for staying on top of news about Mr. Xi. Watching a video about his recent visit to France, for example, earns one point. Getting a perfect score on a quiz about his economic policies earns 10.
The app comes as Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, is leading a broader crackdown on free speech in China, imprisoning scores of activists, lawyers and intellectuals, and imposing new restrictions on the news media. Mr. Xi has spoken frequently about what he calls the need to guard against online threats. He has warned that the party could lose its grip on power if it does not master digital media.
âThere is no national security without internet security,â Mr. Xi said in a speech this year. âIf we cannot succeed on the internet, we will not be able to maintain power in the long run.â
David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, said the app was a way for Mr. Xi to ensure that Chinese families are invested in the life of the party at a time when many dismiss propaganda as stilted and irrelevant.
âLoyalty to the party,â Mr. Bandurski said, âmeans loyalty to Xi Jinping.â
Study the Great Nation in some ways harkens back to the Mao era, when the chairmanâs portrait hung in living rooms and families studied his words feverishly. While Mr. Xi cannot yet match Maoâs grandeur, he has borrowed from Maoâs playbook in his quest to be seen as a singular, transformative force.
The app features a television series called âXi Timeâ and Mr. Xiâs quotations on topics like building a strong military and achieving a âChinese dreamâ of prosperity and strength. The app recommends stories about Mr. Xi on its home screen and sends push notifications highlighting âgolden sentencesâ from his latest speeches. Even the Chinese name for the app is a play on Mr. Xiâs name.
The app, which also offers lighter fare about traditional Chinese culture, history and geography, presents a censored version of current events. Topics such as Chinaâs mass detention of Muslims are not included.
At Hulunbuir University in northern China, school officials monitor the scores of more than 1,100 teachers and students who use the app as part of the schoolâs efforts to spread Mr. Xiâs ideas, known in China as Xi Jinping Thought.
âEveryone studies voluntarily and has very high scores,â said Bai Mei, an ideology instructor at the university.
Not everyone is as enthusiastic. In interviews, students and workers complained that superiors publicly chastised them for low scores. Others said bosses threatened to deduct pay or withhold bonuses if they did not use the app more frequently. They did not want to provide their names for fear of punishment, but some have complained online.
âWhat kind of phenomenon is this?â one user wrote on Weibo, a popular social media site, complaining of a salary deduction. âMy God, what has happened to the party now?â
Critics say Mr. Xi is intruding into the private lives of Chinese citizens in a way the party has typically avoided since the Mao era. The app makes the partyâs messages difficult to ignore, awarding points only when an article has been read completely and a video has been watched for at least three minutes.
âYou cannot divert attention away from it,â said Haiqing Yu, a professor who studies Chinese media at RMIT University in Australia. âItâs a kind of digital surveillance. It brings the digital dictatorship to a new level.â
The app, which was developed by the partyâs Propaganda Department and the technology giant Alibaba, is available on the Apple app store as well as Android app stores in China. The Propaganda Department keeps user data.
It is unclear how closely the government tracks users of Study the Great Nation, but the app requires people to provide a mobile number to register and a national identification number to access videoconference and chat features.
The Propaganda Department declined to comment, as did Alibaba, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Given the pressures to use the app, a cheating industry involving at least a dozen products has flourished. A man who listed his contact information in an online advertisement for cheating software said in an interview that many of his more than 1,000 customers saw the app as a burden imposed by bosses. He declined to provide his name for fear of retribution.
The government has moved swiftly to prosecute cheating and limit criticism of the app. The police in the southeastern province of Jiangxi last month detained a man who sold cheating software for about $13. The police said the man was running an illegal business.
The state-run news media teems with glowing reviews of the app, including stories about diligent hospital workers and kindergarten teachers who open Study the Great Nation as soon as they awaken, even before they drink water or go to the bathroom.
The app has inspired videos by prison guards, raps by children and adulatory song-and-dance routines by power plant workers. Some party members have suggested the app can be used as a dating tool to screen potential mates (âIf you see a guy on the subway using the app,â says one cartoon, âyou should marry himâ).
In Changsha, which coincidentally is an hourâs drive from Maoâs childhood home, the local news media has lauded Mr. Jiang, the owner of the fishing gear store, for his high scores. He and his wife sometimes answer questions on the app together at dinner, alongside their 9-year-old son.
Mr. Jiang said his military training had inspired him to devote himself fully to Study the Great Nation. By using the app, he said, he has grown even more patriotic.
âPresident Xi has a dream of great renaissance,â he said. âWhen young people are strong, the nation is strong.â

"Donald Trump, China Savior? Some Chinese Say Yes","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2245393643?accountid=14586,"Donald J. Trump has referred to China as âour enemy.â He has called it âa major threat.â âRemember,â he once wrote on Twitter, âChina is not a friend of the United States!â
Some people in China have their own label for the polarizing American president: savior.
At dinner tables, in social media chats and in discreet conversations, some of the countryâs intellectual and business elite are half-jokingly, half-seriously cheering on the leader who has built a large part of his political career on China-bashing.
âOnly Trump can save China,â goes one quip. Others call him the âchief pressure officerâ of Chinaâs reform and opening.
Their semi-serious praise reflects the deepening despair among those in China who fear their country is on the wrong track. An aggressive outsider like President Trump, according to this thinking, can help China find its way again.
The Communist Party has become more involved in business, the economy, public discourse and other elements of everyday life. Many of these elite fear that after 40 years of reform and opening up, China is retreating. To make matters worse, nobody at home appears willing or able to fight the trend. President Xi Jinping has become the countryâs most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, hurting the chances that internal opposition can push back.
Then came Mr. Trump and his trade war. Among other demands, American negotiators are calling on China to play a smaller role in the countryâs economy. They want the Chinese government to stop throwing money at state-controlled companies. They want lower trade barriers and a level playing field for private businesses.
That puts Mr. Trump, oddly, in sync with a number of Chinese intellectuals and business types. Should the Communist Party step back from the economy, their thinking goes, it might have to loosen its tight grip over the rest of society, too.
âThe trade war is a good thing,â said Zhu Ning, an economist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. âIt gives us hope when weâre hopeless.â
âThe various demands by the U.S. government could force us to carry on with the reforms,â said Tao Jingzhou, a partner at the law firm Dechertâs Beijing office. âThereâs a Chinese saying that carrying out a reform is equivalent to a man cutting off his own arm, which is very hard. It might help if someone else forces you to do it.â
Even some retired officials have said they believe that the trade war could have positive effects. Long Yongtu, who led the negotiations for Chinaâs entry into the World Trade Organization, said at a forum last month that trade friction could be âa good thing.â
It could be âa healthy pressure that pushes China to move forward,â he said.
The chances that Mr. Trump alone can change China's ways are exceedingly slim. The Communist Party risks looking weak if it agrees to too many of his demands. True reform would have to come from inside.
âWe canât count on the external force to save China,â said Wang Gongquan, a billionaire liberal activist and former venture capitalist. He was among the first group of people who were detained or jailed after the party intensified the crackdown on dissent and civil disobedience six years ago.
âChanges will only come,â Mr. Wang added, âwhen responsible people inside and outside the government push for it together.â
Still, the hopes about Mr. Trump acknowledge the role the outside world has played in Chinaâs gradual opening over the past four decades. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party has largely been a reluctant reformer, often pushed and lured by internal and external forces.
Even some in the Trump administration seem to be hoping that internal voices will speak up. In an interview with National Public Radio, Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trumpâs top trade negotiator, was asked about the likelihood that the trade war would lead to changes in China.
âYou have to start with the proposition that there are people in China who believe that reform is a good idea,â Mr. Lighthizer said. âAnd you have to believe that those people are at a very senior level.â
The challenge now will be to find those internal voices in a time when dissent can be quickly squelched.
âUnfortunately, thereâs no force to be joined with in China,â said Liu Suli, a liberal thinker and enthusiastic Trump supporter who founded an independent bookstore in Beijing. âThereâs only a pool of stagnant water.â
The breadth of support for Mr. Trump in China isnât clear. Many business leaders dare not speak out for fear of angering the Communist Party.
The talk is hard to miss. The first time I heard the âOnly Trump can save Chinaâ quip was a few months ago from a self-described apolitical tech entrepreneur in Guangdong Province in southern China. He complained about rising taxes and growing government interference in the economy. He was worried that if his start-up failed, he could end up on a newly created blacklist that would prevent him from taking flights and checking in at some hotels.
This image of Mr. Trump is often at odds with reality. Supporters of his who have long pushed China on human rights are cheering a president who wants to make it harder for migrants fleeing political persecution to find sanctuary in the United States. Itâs a strange disconnect to listen to graying activists â educated free thinkers, some of whom have gone to prison for their ideals â put their hopes in a man who openly admires autocrats and calls journalists âthe enemy of the people.â
Optimists nevertheless point to signs that they say show Mr. Trump is having an impact. Facing both the trade war and a slowdown in growth that began in the middle of last year, Chinaâs leadership has embraced some modest liberalization. The government has promised to cut taxes, ease other burdens on the private sector and give markets a somewhat bigger role in the economy.
âMore market-oriented actions are being reconsidered or put back on the table,â said Mr. Zhu, the Tsinghua economist. âIn this sense, the trade war is helping Chinaâs reform.â
But thereâs little evidence that the leadership is easing its grip in a lasting way. The few business-friendly gestures are reactive rather than proactive. In other words, there hasnât been any fundamental change in the leadershipâs thinking. The party must control, as Mr. Xi has said, âall tasks.â
Some Chinese supporters of Mr. Trump, particularly dissidents or those living in exile, believe that he plans something bigger: regime change. Liu Junning, a pro-democracy dissident in Beijing, pointed to Vice President Mike Penceâs stern speech in October in which he accused China of numerous offenses over the years. Mr. Liu also pointed to Venezuela, where the Trump administration has pushed for new leadership.
In part, this group believes past presidents were too soft on Chinaâs Communist Party. But they also cite the patina of toughness that Mr. Trump accumulated in his pre-political days. Mr. Liu cited Mr. Trumpâs book âThe Art of the Dealâ and his reality TV show, âThe Apprentice.â
âTrumpâs approach is that he gives you a task and he expects you to get it done. Otherwise, youâre fired,â Mr. Liu said, alluding to the reality show. âHe can be very tough.â
How tough he will be about fixing Chinaâs economy still isnât clear. In public comments, Mr. Trump has focused on getting China to buy more American goods. His advisers have said he will press for economic reforms, but any pledge by China to cut subsidies to state-owned companies or favored industries would be difficult to verify, much less enforce.
âI donât think helping China to reform is Trumpâs main political goal,â Mr. Zhu said. âHe may just want something to tweet about.â

"As China Trade Talks Stall, Xi Faces a Dilemma: Fold? Or Double Down?","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244223082?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â As Chinese and American officials try to reach a trade deal, President Xi Jinping faces a painful, possibly damaging, choice: to try to protect his aura of indomitability or retreat after President Trump accused China of reneging on the terms of a draft agreement and threatened to raise tariffs.
The stakes rose sharply for the Chinese leader this week after Mr. Trump and his chief trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, publicly accused China of backing down on commitments. The sticking point appeared to be a late decision by Mr. Xi to reject American demands that China change laws constraining American businesses.
When Mr. Trump leapt onto Twitter to complain, it was a public rebuke that put Mr. Xi in a tight spot.
Mr. Xi is Chinaâs most powerful leader in decades, and he guards his image as a visionary statesman guiding his country to greatness. But Chinaâs relationship with the United States is its most important, and if ties between the countries are mismanaged, that could damage Chinaâs economy and tarnish Mr. Xiâs authority.
Trade talks that just last week seemed close to fruition have abruptly become a flash point in the rocky relationship. Mr. Xi now faces questions at home over whether he miscalculated Mr. Trumpâs resolve, and domestic rumblings could grow if the United States forces Mr. Xi to make concessions or if the talks break down.
[Update: President Trump escalated his trade war with China on Friday morning, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.]
âXi is walking a tightrope,â said Paul Haenle, a former China director on the National Security Council who now runs the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center For Global Policy in Beijing. âHe is going to be the one that has to make the most concessions, and that makes all this more difficult for him.â
But geopolitics could help China point to the many ways the sides need each other.
On Thursday, shortly before the trade talks were set to resume, North Korea shot off short-range missiles. The United States has long pressed China, the Northâs main political and economic supporter, to help rein in the countryâs provocations.
Even if the timing of the launches is a coincidence, they could serve to remind the United States that it needs Chinaâs help to maintain pressure on the North and keep its nuclear program in check.
âI come bearing sincerity, and hope in the current special circumstances to hold a reasoned, frank exchange of views with the U.S. side,â Liu He, Chinaâs chief negotiator in the trade talks said after arriving in Washington, according to Xinhua, Chinaâs official news agency. âChina believes that increasing tariffs wonât solve problems, wonât benefit China or the United States, and nor will it benefit the global economy.â
Still, a resolution of the trade war during this weekâs talks seems challenging.
China had been willing to protect intellectual property and open its markets to American business, but the Trump administration wanted the agreement to specify that some of those changes be made in Chinese law. For China, any legislative change or policy reversal could be a very public â and potentially humbling â reminder that it gave ground under pressure.
âThat would bring back painful memories of the days of national humiliation in our history,â said Wang Yong, the director of the Center for International Political Economy at Peking University. âChina has made too many concessions.â
The blaring nature of the Trump administrationâs broadsides has sharpened the dilemma that Mr. Xi faces in the negotiations.
âTo have Trump doing it so publicly is obviously very, very difficult for Xi Jinping,â said Susan L. Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who worked as a deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for China under President Bill Clinton. âIt makes it much more difficult for him to make the compromises needed.â
On Friday, Mr. Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. The Chinese government said in a statement it would âhave to take necessary countermeasuresâ but didnât say what those would be. The higher tariffs could shake confidence vital to keeping aloft economic growth in China and around the world, Tu Xinquan, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said in an interview.
For the party, stable economic growth is fundamental to political legitimacy.
âEveryone may have greater doubts and uncertainty about the future of the Chinese economy, Chinese-U.S. relations or the global economy,â Professor Tu said. âThis uncertainty will certainly affect production, investment, and consumption.â
At their first summit meeting just two years ago, Mr. Xi told Mr. Trump that China and the United States had âa thousand reasonsâ to work well together. But the slow pace of negotiations could tarnish in Mr. Xiâs carefully drawn image at home as a master strategist.
More than two years into the Trump presidency, Chinese officials still appear to struggle to understand the president, his temperament and his negotiating style. American politicians and experts say that Chinese counterparts often fail to grasp how far and fast wariness of China has hardened into hostility.
âThere are a lot of voices in Washington that are either sharply or harshly critical of Chinaâs actions in trade, in their military expansionism, in their actions in the South China Sea â fill in the blank,â Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat senator from Delaware, said in an interview in Beijing late last month after meeting Chinese officials.
Mr. Xiâs top economic official, Mr. Liu, a vice premier who leads the Chinese negotiators, could also suffer a setback in his standing if the latest talks falter.
âIf, say, Liu He comes back to Beijing empty-handed, and thereâs more tirades from Trump on his Twitter account, I think things could get really wild,â Zhang Jian, an associate professor of government at Peking University, said in an interview. âItâs going to spill out of the economic waters.â
Some of the discord may stem from Chinese resistance to American calls for legislation that would prohibit a range of direct cash assistance to Chinese companies.
China has also opposed American requests to change Chinaâs cybersecurity law, counterterrorism law, and recently passed foreign investment law. Some of that legislation requires foreign companies to share sensitive information with the Chinese authorities and also requires them to use Chinese-approved equipment â and, therefore, probably Chinese-made equipment, which American companies and officials fear could be a security risk.
Just over a week ago, the outlook for the trade negotiations seemed rosier. Chinese and American officials met in Beijing then for a 10th round of talks aimed at easing trade and economic tensions that spiked after Mr. Trump progressively imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods last year.
Shortly before the talks last week started, the United States Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the negotiations were in their âfinal laps.â After the talks ended, he said on Twitter that they had been âproductive.â
But then Mr. Lighthizer and other Trump administration officials accused Chinese negotiators of trying to reverse concessions they had already made. The air of optimism evaporated.
The Trump officials said that China had retreated from draft agreements calling on its legislature to change laws that have threatened or constricted American trade and business. Two Chinese scholars in Beijing said they were told by well-placed officials that the changes in commitments appeared after Mr. Xi reviewed the draft deal. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal party matters.
The Chinese government disputed the claims of an underhanded rollback, saying Thursday it was normal for negotiating sides to disagree during talks. âChina values trustworthiness and keeps its promises,â Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said at a briefing. âIt has never changed.â
The Chinese have also complained about dealing with a mercurial president they say is apt to turn private disagreements into public brawls.
âTrumpâs personality is different, we all know,â said Professor Tu. âHe would take something that hasnât been settled in negotiations and treat it as so-called backsliding by China, or whatever, and then announce it.
âAn ordinary president,â he said, âwouldnât act this way.â
Negotiations with the United States have always been fraught for Chinese officials. Memories of bad blood linger.
In 1999, Zhu Rongji, then the vice premier, went to Washington hoping to reach a breakthrough deal that would open Chinaâs way to joining the World Trade Organization â only to have President Clinton balk.
Mr. Zhu returned to Beijing with his reputation damaged. A month later, the United States accidentally bombed Chinaâs embassy in Belgrade during NATOâs war over Kosovo, igniting bitter protests against Washington across China. It took almost three more years before China joined the W.T.O.
Now Mr. Xi must find a way to satisfy the Trump administration without appearing to give away too much. That could be more difficult if Mr. Trump continues to pelt Mr. Xi with demands on Twitter.
âI think the Chinese side is in an uncomfortable position, as they are reactive instead of controlling the situation as they are accustomed,â said James L. McGregor, a consultant in Shanghai and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
There are grave risks for both sides if the trade talks collapse entirely, many economists say.
Some Chinese academics and business executives have already argued privately and online that Mr. Xi misjudged how far he could push Mr. Trump and promote China as a potential rival to the United Statesâ dominance.
Mr. Trump, too, would not walk away unscathed. A breakdown in negotiations could weigh down American stock prices, which Mr. Trump invokes as a measure of his policy successes.
Even if the talks in Washington end with handshakes and a new agreement, the past week has laid bare a lack of trust between China and the United States. Tensions over technology competition, spying, Taiwan, the South China Sea and other trouble spots could well up, said Professor Zhang, the Peking University academic.
âThe more important thing is not whether thereâs a deal or no deal,â he said. âItâs the consensus in the American political class about China as a threat.â

U.S.-China Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader Economic War,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244223752?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.
Progress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the worldâs two largest economies.
The United States is increasingly wary of Chinaâs emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.
The Trump administration has begun trying to limit Chinaâs economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about Chinaâs ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared Chinaâs ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses âa new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime thatâs integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.â
The United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting Chinaâs role in building Americaâs next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.
The F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.
China, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Partyâs Peopleâs Daily newspaper stated, âThe United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging Chinaâs strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.â
The piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng â the âvoice of Chinaâ â a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.
Restraining Chinaâs ambitions and methods is a tricky task â and there is concern that the Trump administrationâs effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.
âWeâve got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,â said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. âItâs just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.â
Chinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.
The two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, Chinaâs vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal âjust a small setback in the talks between two countries,â while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as âcandid and constructive.â
While a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trumpâs advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls Chinaâs practices of âeconomic aggression.â
But the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that arenât in Chinaâs interest.
Mr. Liu, who is leading Chinaâs team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.
âNow both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,â he said. âWe believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles â we canât make concessions on matters of principle.â
Despite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.
Instead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins â tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.
âThis is a decades-long endeavor,â said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Centerâs Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. âThis canât be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.â
The notion that the United States has one last shot to change Chinaâs behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the worldâs largest economy.
Many in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.
It has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.
Many in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United Statesâ. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.
While the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, Chinaâs resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.
And the Chinese view some of the Trump administrationâs demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy â including requiring the country to codify changes through legislation in the National Peopleâs Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.
Mr. Trump on Saturday suggested China was simply delaying a deal in the hopes that a Democrat would win election in 2020 and continued his pugilistic approach, saying âthe deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!â
In the United States, Chinaâs unwillingness to bow to Americaâs demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.
That is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.
That has not happened.
China has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.
But in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the worldâs largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.
On the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.
China is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.
While American companies have long hankered for access to Chinaâs growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see Chinaâs practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.
Chinaâs own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.
âEven if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,â said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. âThere is no coming back, even if there is a deal.â

U.S.-China Trade Talks Stumble on Beijingâs Spending at Home,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244219690?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â One year ago, when he began a multibillion-dollar trade war with China that shook the global economy, President Trump demanded that Beijing end lavish government spending aimed at making the country a world power in computer chips, robotics, commercial aircraft and other industries of the future.
Today, as the two sides struggle to reach a truce, the Trump administration is finding just how difficult that will be.
Trade talks between the United States and China nearly ground to a halt this past week, and a seemingly intractable dispute over subsidies is a big part of it. Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, accused China last Monday of reneging on what he described as âgood, firm commitments on eliminating market-distorting subsidies.â Vice Premier Liu He, the leader of Chinaâs negotiating team, said that it was normal for negotiations to have ups and downs, but has also nodded to the subsidies issue in vowing repeatedly over the last several days not to bend on Chinaâs principles.
President Trump on Friday raised tariffs on $200 billion a year worth of Chinese goods, hitting goods leaving Chinaâs shores as of that day. He has directed Mr. Lighthizer to start on Monday the long process for raising tariffs on all Chinese goods.
In talks and in an exchange of documents, Chinese negotiators surprised their American counterparts by calling at the start of this month for numerous changes, people familiar with the negotiations said. While the requests covered everything from intellectual property to currency manipulation, the hardened Chinese stance against limiting government subsidies poses a particular challenge.
The United States wants China to enshrine limits on subsidies in its national laws. China says it will not let a foreign country tell it how to change its laws. A schedule of planned legislation released by Chinese officials on Saturday did not include any of the subsidy-related measures that Washington has sought.
Beijing has long helped its homegrown industries in strategically important areas like jetliners and parts for nuclear reactors. It also supports efforts to build up Chinaâs high-tech industries like microchips and self-driving cars to make sure the economy will stay competitive.
Stopping, or even tracking, Chinaâs subsidies is a difficult task. Many subsidies take the form of cheap loans from government-controlled banks or through other opaque arrangements. Foreign companies also complain that they are often shut out of local government contracts through written and unwritten rules, giving Chinese competitors a strong base at home while they pursue global expansion plans.
China has agreed to disclose more information about its subsidies and stop those that violate rules under the World Trade Organization, the global trade referee. But the two sides are also at loggerheads over how to interpret those W.T.O. rules, said people familiar with the talks, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
In his news briefing last Monday, Mr. Lighthizer said Chinaâs trade negotiators had made significant, enforceable commitments to the United States, but added that âsome peopleâ in China had objected to them, without saying who. Chinaâs trade negotiators are heavily drawn from the ranks of the countryâs market-oriented economic reformers and have long been at odds with officials who want greater reliance on heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises.
The Trump administration insists on leaving in place tariffs on imports from heavily subsidized Chinese industries, at least for this year. That would protect the American market in industries that trade hawks within the administration see as strategically crucial.
Chinese officials oppose those tariffs. Mr. Liu told Chinese state-controlled media on Saturday that the Chinese government âbelieves that tariffs are the starting point for trade disputes between the two sides â if an agreement is to be reached, the tariffs must all be canceled.â
Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that tariffs imposed bilaterally were a poor tool to address a global problem like overcapacity. Even if the United States successfully kept part of the tariffs in place, they would protect only American business at home. Subsidized Chinese business could still compete at home, in Europe and almost everywhere else around the globe, hurting prospects for American exporters.
In the United States, Democrats have been increasingly critical of the Trump administration for not obtaining more trade policy concessions. Yet even some Democrats said they saw limited prospects that China will agree to reduce subsidies.
âTo expect the end of essentially a planned or a centralized economy would be awfully ambitious,â Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said in a recent interview in Beijing.
âTo be fair the Obama administration got nowhere, the Bush administration got nowhere,â Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said about convincing China to roll back its subsidies. âThis is a crucial way the Chinese run their economy.â
If a trade deal does not fully cover subsidies, the United States could resort to unconventional responses. For example, the United States has pushed for an extensive revision of its laws surrounding foreign investments and exports of high-tech products, primarily aimed at China, to try to preserve its commercial and military edge.
The Trump administration has made some progress in the emerging trade deal on other ways the Chinese government props up its industries. Beijing has promised to tell its state-controlled banks to show less favoritism in lending to state-owned enterprises instead of private sector businesses. Beijing has also pledged to open up the bidding for government contracts to foreign companies, instead of reserving them almost completely for Chinese companies.
If China opens up the bidding, âthat would actually, genuinely move the market needle on opportunities for foreign companies in China,â said Scott Kennedy, a China economic policy specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
On the issue of subsidies, China has grown more quiet. Its âMade in China 2025â plan two years ago called for $300 billion in special financing and other assistance for 10 advanced manufacturing industries. China shelved the catchy name for the program in recent months, while expressing determination to continue investing in âhigh-quality manufacturing.â
China is willing to publicly list and disclose subsidies from its central government, people familiar with the trade talks said. But instead of disclosing these subsidies to the United States, which might be seen by the Chinese public as humiliating, the Chinese government wants to disclose them through the W.T.O., which would then pass on the list to its members.
W.T.O. rules ban governments from helping exporting companies with cash, free land and other easily measured gifts. The rules are somewhat looser on measures like cheap loans from state-controlled banks or efforts to replace imports by fostering domestic production of the same goods.
Beijing has told American negotiators that it will end subsidies if they are breaking W.T.O. rules. But the Chinese national governmentâs assistance to industries tends to fall into the categories that are hardest to prove as violating W.T.O. rules.
In China, the subsidies more likely to break W.T.O. rules tend to be given to exporters by provincial and local government agencies in China. In the trade talks with the United States, Beijing has agreed to look for provincial and local subsidies that may violate W.T.O. rules, but has been resistant to passing legislation that would abolish them, people familiar with the talks said.
At least a few market-oriented Chinese government officials have worried that broad subsidies might be squandered by companies more interested in taking the governmentâs money than in creating competitive products. But these critics appear to be a shrinking minority.
Lou Jiwei, a prominent advocate of economic reform and the chairman of Chinaâs social security fund, told The South China Morning Post in early March that the Made in China 2025 plan âwasted taxpayersâ money.â
Mentions of Mr. Lou immediately disappeared from state-controlled media. There followed a cursory statement by the official Xinhua news agency on April 4 that he had been removed from his post at the social security fund. No reason was given.

Did China Break the World Economic Order?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244212745?accountid=14586,"Last Friday, the White House raised the tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports up to 25 percent. On Monday, China retaliated with tariffs of its own. The trade war is now full-on â except that itâs not really about trade .
China does account for the largest share of Americaâs trade deficit. But many experts donât seem to think that bilateral trade deficits are a problem in themselves â theyâre just a symptom of other issues (if even that). âThe overall United States global trade imbalance is the result of economic conditions in the United States â the excess of investment over savings,â Martin Feldstein, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has argued, adding that if Americaâs trade imbalance with China were eliminated, it would simply shift to other countries.
Whether President Trump is misguided in doggedly pursuing tariffs or playing coy and using them as leverage with the Chinese government, Americaâs continued drive to levy penalties is less about fixing a trade problem than about changing Chinaâs investment rules. In particular, the Trump administration perceives those rules as forcing the transfer of foreign technology to Chinese companies, unfairly helping them.
But even American negotiators who parse the trade versus tech issue this clearly tend to overlook an essential fact: The international trade and financial system that was set up after World War II â with the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and, much later, the World Trade Organization (all nurtured and dominated by the United States) â actively encouraged âtechnological spilloversâ from developed economies to developing ones. Under the W.T.O.âs agreements on intellectual property, developed countries are under âthe obligationâ to provide incentives to their companies to transfer technology to less developed countries.
Such transfers were seen to be in the Westâs interest, too: Far better that poor countries achieve self-sustaining growth than be dependent on foreign aid, the thinking went. But China did much better than achieve self-sustaining growth.
By the late 2000s, it had come to seem too successful, and a threat: The West was struggling then with a major financial crisis (largely of its own doing). Today, the longstanding principle that knowledge transfers are good all-around is being questioned. Do they continue to serve the global interest and should they still be encouraged â even when it comes to China? Or should China be treated as an exception? It is in a class of its own, by dint of both its size and the stateâs involvement in its economy.
American negotiators have long complained that Chinaâs foreign investment practices are unfair. A report of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, published in 2013 and often cited since, estimated that China accounted for 50 to 80 percent of all international intellectual property theft. In its 2018 report, the Office of the United States Trade Representative accused China of using joint ventures to funnel technology to Chinese companies and of failing to protect foreign companiesâ intellectual property rights.
But the reality is more complex.
Yes, American companies have been granted access to some 35 restricted sectors in China â like auto production, oil exploration, nuclear power, telecommunications, banks and medical institutions â only on the condition that they transfer know-how to local partners. Chinese companies are developing electric vehicles with support from Renault-Nissan and Ford. Amazon and Microsoft are being asked to partner â and share technology â with Chinese companies before they can sell cloud-computing services in China.
And yes, DuPont and General Motors have sued their Chinese joint-venture partners for misappropriating trade secrets. Outright theft also has sometimes occurred, including in the defense sector, of information about bombers and missile systems.
But to say all these things in the same breath is to risk conflating inadequate rules with violations of existing rules that may be adequate, and government policy with the behavior of private actors. Officials in the Trump administration suggest that Chinaâs foreign-investment requirements themselves amount to theft. In many instances, however, technology is being transferred between companies in the context of consensual, negotiated business agreements.
Also, violations or near-violations are par for the course during certain stages of a countryâs development. That fact doesnât make them acceptable, but it offers useful context for thinking through how best to react to them. Other rapidly growing economies, including Japan and South Korea in the 1980s, were also accused of unfairly securing technology from foreign partners (or subsidizing their exports). But as those countriesâ incomes rose and their own capacity to innovate developed, they started complying with the rules â typically when per capita income reached $25,000.
China, at its current growth rates, is more than a decade away from achieving that income level. And yet it has already made more progress than is usually acknowledged toward protecting intellectual property rights. AmCham Chinaâs 2019 China Business Climate Survey Report noted that 59 percent of the more than 300 American companies it interviewed said that Chinaâs enforcement of intellectual property rights had improved over the last five years; 37 percent said it had stayed the same. (China is growing up in other respects, too. Both the I.M.F. and the United States Treasury have recently determined that the Chinese government is not manipulating its currency. And its current account surpluses have virtually evaporated.)
That said, penalties for, say, infringing patents remain weak in China and enforcement is lax. The National Peopleâs Congress passed a foreign-investment law in March, but it offered too little on implementation. In fact, the United Statesâs latest tariffs were prompted by its perception that the Chinese government was backtracking on its commitment to incorporate into Chinese law major terms of the two countriesâ draft agreement to end the trade war.
The fundamental question, therefore, is this: Are Chinaâs current technology-transfer policies fair, given both past international practice and the countryâs extraordinary development? Or, to put the point more provocatively, did Chinaâs growth break the international economic order?
The answer partly depends on the existence, or not, of globally accepted guidelines. Just last year, in its World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. again highlighted the vital role that the diffusion of technology worldwide has played in driving growth globally . And China now accounts for almost one-third of global growth every year, according to Bloomberg.
A more innovative China also doesnât mean a less competitive America. For one thing, as the Harvard economist Robert Lawrence has pointed out, developed countries and developing ones generally do not compete in the same product lines. The economist Zhang Jun and others have also argued that much of Chinaâs technological capacities are overstated anyway. Many of the more sophisticated components used in products that China exports to the West (think iPhones) are made elsewhere and merely assembled in China.
Curbs on Americaâs exports of âemerging and foundational technologiesâ â notably to do with artificial intelligence or fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks â will curtail knowledge flows to China. But they will also damage Americaâs capacity for innovation, American tech experts have argued. (Likewise, Mr. Trumpâs decision this week to ban, on security grounds, foreign tech equipment in American telecommunications systems could hurt American companies.)
Technology transfers from the most developed states to less developed ones remain beneficial all-around, including for the most developed states â even if the unique features of Chinaâs remarkable growth require adapting existing norms and regulatory mechanisms to better manage those transfers.
The Trump administration, which instinctively recoils at multilateral initiatives, is unlikely to want to turn to the W.T.O. or the World Bank. (It should, though, not least because the United States has usually fared well by W.T.O. rulings.) The next best opportunity to at least broach these issues will be during the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, in June. Chinaâs growth may seem like a challenge to the worldâs economic order, but it is other statesâ reactions to it that could threaten the system.

Australiaâs China Challenge,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244183189?accountid=14586,"SYDNEY, Australia â In a gold-curtained meeting room in Sydney, the Chinese consul general appealed to a closed-door gathering of about 100 people, all of them Australian residents and citizens of Chinese ancestry.
He called on the group to help shape public opinion during a coming visit of Chinaâs prime minister, Li Keqiang, in part by reporting critics to the consulate. Rallies in support of China should be coordinated, he suggested, and large banners should be unfurled to block images of protests against Beijing.
âWe are not troops, but this task is a bit like the nature of troops,â said the diplomat, Gu Xiaojie, according to a recording of the session in the consulate obtained by The New York Times and verified by a person who was in the room. âThis is a war,â he added, âwith lots of battles.â
The previously unreported meeting in March 2017 is an example of how the Chinese government directly â and often secretly â engages in political activity in Australia, making the nation a laboratory for testing how far it can go to steer debate and influence policy inside a democratic trade partner.
It is a calculated campaign unlike any other Australia has faced â taking advantage of the nationâs openness, growing ethnic Chinese population and economic ties to China â and it has provoked an uncomfortable debate about how Australia should respond.
Many countries face the same challenge from China, an authoritarian power pushing its agenda inside and beyond its borders.
In Asia, China has been accused of funneling funds to the campaigns of preferred candidates in Malaysia and Sri Lanka. In the United States, there is concern about Beijingâs efforts to stifle dissent on college campuses. And in Europe, Chinese companies and organizations tied to the ruling Communist Party have held events for political leaders and donated millions of dollars to universities.
China once sought to spread Marxist revolution around the world, but its goal now is more subtle â winning support for a trade and foreign policy agenda intended to boost its geopolitical standing and maintain its monopoly on power at home.
The contours of its playbook are especially visible in Australia, where trade with China has fueled the worldâs longest economic boom. Australian intelligence agencies have warned of Beijingâs efforts, and the issue is likely to be contentious for Australiaâs conservative prime minister, Scott Morrison, who won a surprise victory in elections Saturday.
Representatives of the Chinese government routinely lobby Australian politicians behind closed doors without disclosing their activities, often by threatening economic punishment and persuading Australian business and academic leaders to deliver their message.
The Chinese government and its supporters have also sought to suppress criticism and elevate its views in the Australian news media, by suing journalists and publishers for defamation, financing research institutes and using advertisers to put pressure on Chinese-language outlets.
Beijing has even promoted political candidates in Australia with these outlets as well as via the United Front Work Department, the partyâs arm for dealing with overseas Chinese, and â according to some assessments â with campaign contributions made by proxies.
Last year, after a scandal involving donors with ties to Beijing forced a senator to resign, Parliament approved an overhaul of espionage laws making it illegal to influence Australian politics for a foreign government.
Australiaâs new government â led by Mr. Morrison, who has been vague about his plans for foreign policy â must now decide what to do next at a time when the public is divided: Many Australians fear China but also favor good relations to maintain economic growth and regional stability.
âThere is a lot to unravel with the China story here,â said Mark Harrison, a China scholar at the University of Tasmania.
The Communist Party, he said, is essentially trying to enforce the same bargain with Australia that it has with the Chinese people: a promise of prosperity in exchange for obedience and censorship.
Weaponized Economics
Chinaâs economic bonds with Australia can be traced to the 19th century, when a gold rush drew Chinese immigrants to the continent. Now, China is an engine of economic growth for the country and its largest trading partner by far, accounting for 24 percent of Australian imports and exports.
With that reliance comes an implied threat: China can take its money elsewhere.
The problem, current and former Australian officials say, is the Chinese government rarely discloses its lobbying activities. Australian businesses linked to China often lean on politicians without public scrutiny, leading security agencies to warn about Beijing manipulating politics.
[Want Australia news in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter . ]
âIn no country is there such a profound rift between business community and security,â said Linda Jakobson, founding director of China Matters, a nonprofit policy group based in Sydney.
Critics say China has exploited that rift â and even tried to use its economic leverage to punish Australia for adopting the new law requiring those working on behalf of a âforeign principalâ to register their activities.
In June, Australian winemakers said they were facing problems with their exports to China, and a major deal to expand chilled beef exports into China â negotiated during Mr. Liâs visit â stalled. In January and February, China also delayed coal imports from Australia at some ports.
Beijing denied any effort to punish Australia, and Australian politicians have brushed off these disputes. But it is hardly the first time Beijing blurred the lines between business and politics.
In 2009, the Australian government rejected a bid by a Chinese state-owned firm to purchase 18 percent of Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian mining giant, after officials argued privately that the sale would give China too much power to set prices.
Beijingâs response was an early version of what has since become common in the relationship: a campaign to pressure the Australian government via Chinaâs business partners.
Chinese officials and investors âput the weights on the relevant Australian executives,â Kevin Rudd, the prime minister at the time, recalled in an interview. âThe whole idea at that stage was to maximize business lobby pressure on the government.â
Silencing Dissent
In May 2018, two children in Rockhampton, a rural capital of beef production, painted tiny Taiwanese flags on a statue of a bull during an event celebrating the townâs diversity. There were flags from many countries, but the local government painted over those from Taiwan to avoid offending Beijing, which says the self-governing island is part of China.
âWhat they want are pre-emptive concessions to Chinese interests,â said Peter Varghese, a former head of Australiaâs Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
Analysts say Beijing tries both to suppress speech in Australia that undercuts its priorities â such as the diplomatic isolation of Taiwan â and to promote its own agenda.
Critics say one prominent example is the Australia-China Relations Institute, a research organization in Sydney led until recently by Bob Carr, a former foreign minister and outspoken defender of Chinaâs positions. The institute was established with a gift from Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese real-estate developer who had donated generously to both of Australiaâs main political parties.
Australia recently rejected his citizenship application and revoked his residency, despite his denials of having acted on behalf of the Communist Party.
China has also had success shaping news coverage in Australia, especially in Chinese-language outlets.
Maree Ma, general manager of the company that owns Vision China Times, a newspaper in Sydney and Melbourne, said Chinese officials successfully pressured businesses in 2015 and 2016 to pull their ads because of its critical coverage.
And before Saturdayâs election, on WeChat â the Chinese social media platform, which is also popular in Australia â accounts affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party mocked the conservative government, disparaging Australia as âa country whose head has been kicked hard by kangaroos.â
English-language outlets are not immune to the pressure. In 2017, one of Australiaâs largest independent publishers delayed publication of a book examining Chinese influence in Australian institutions.
Because Australian law favors plaintiffs in defamation suits, some say such cases â including a large payout in February to Chau Chak Wing, a Chinese-born property tycoon and political donor â have had a chilling effect on reporting and public protesting that might anger Beijing or its allies.
At the Chinese consulate in 2017, organizers showed photos of pro-China activists in Australia roughing up protesters from the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which is banned in China.
The audience applauded.
Running for Office
Chinaâs playbook prioritizes one particular group: Australiaâs growing ethnic Chinese population, a diverse group of more than one million people, about half of whom are immigrants from mainland China.
At times, the Chinese government treats Australian citizens of Chinese ancestry as if theyâre still subject to its rule. Critics of Beijing are often pressured. In January, Yang Hengjun, an Australian writer and former Chinese official, was arrested on dubious charges of espionage while visiting China.
More often, Beijing tries to woo people like Yongbei Tang.
Ms. Tang moved to Australia 23 years ago with her husband, an electrical engineer, settling in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, where she started editing a newspaper called Chinese News Tasmania. Last year, she ran for the City Council.
âAll the people in the community know me,â she said, when asked why. âIâm a media person. Influential.â
Ms. Tang had also helped start a local chapter of the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China, which promulgates Beijingâs position that Taiwan is part of China. The group was established by Mr. Huang, the donor whose residency was revoked, and Australian intelligence officials say it is an arm of the partyâs overseas influence efforts.
That connection and others made Ms. Tang, an Australian citizen, a subject of intense debate during the campaign, which she lost. Several local Chinese leaders published an open letter condemning her âhiding of titles of many organizations including her association with the Chinese Government.â
Cassy OâConnor, the leader of the local Greens Party, accused her of being part of an attempt by Beijing to dominate the Tasmanian tourism and property investment. âThe Chinese government actually picks off smaller states like Tasmania, with smaller economies,â she said.
Ms. Tang denied any ties to the party. âThe only wrongdoing I did was to put my hand up, wishing to add a different voice to the Hobart City Council,â she said.
What Ms. Tang actually reveals, analysts say, is the partyâs ability to recruit sympathizers around the world, many of whom gravitate to Beijingâs orbit less because of ideology than the potential for wealth and influence. Even after her loss, she received favorable coverage on state television in China.
For many, Australian politics has become an increasingly valuable option â one of many ways to potentially benefit from Chinese power and prosperity.
âWe are no longer the sick man of East Asia,â said one business leader at the consulate meeting in 2017. âWe Chinese stand tall.â

China Deserves Donald Trump,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244180784?accountid=14586,"A U.S. businessman friend of mine who works in China remarked to me recently that Donald Trump is not the American president America deserves, but he sure is the American president China deserves.
Trumpâs instinct that America needs to rebalance its trade relationship with Beijing â before China gets too big to compromise â is correct. And it took a human wrecking ball like Trump to get Chinaâs attention. But now that we have it, both countries need to recognize just how pivotal this moment is.
The original U.S.-China opening back in the 1970s defined our restored trade ties, which were limited. When we let China join the World Trade Organization in 2001, it propelled China into a trading powerhouse under rules that still gave China lots of concessions as a developing economy.
This new negotiation will define how the U.S. and China relate as economic peers, competing for the same 21st-century industries, at a time when our markets are totally intertwined. So this is no ordinary trade dispute. This is the big one.
For it to end well, Trump will have to stop with his juvenile taunting of China on Twitter (and talking about how trade wars are âeasyâ to win) and quietly forge the best rebalancing deal we can get â we probably canât fix everything at once â and move on, without stumbling unthinkingly into a forever tariff war.
And Chinaâs president, Xi Jinping, will have to recognize that China can no longer enjoy the trading privileges it has had over the last 40 years, so heâd be wise to curb his nationalistic âno-one-tells-China-what-to-doâ bluster and look for the best win-win deal he can get. Because Beijing canât afford America and others shifting their manufacturing to âABC,â Anywhere-But-China, supply chains.
Here is how we got here: Since the 1970s, the U.S.-China trade relationship has been pretty constant: We bought Chinaâs toys, T-shirts, tennis shoes, machine tools and solar panels, and it bought our soybeans, beef and Boeings.
And when the trade balance got too out of whack â because China grew not only by hard work, by building smart infrastructure and by educating its people, but also by forcing technology transfers from U.S. companies, subsidizing its own companies, maintaining high tariffs, ignoring W.T.O. rulings and stealing intellectual property â Beijing placated us by buying more Boeings, beef and soybeans.
China kept insisting it was still âa poor developing countryâ that needed extra protection long after it had become the worldâs largest manufacturer by far. Nevertheless, the relationship worked for enough U.S. companies enough of the time that the worldâs biggest incumbent superpower, America, accommodated and effectively facilitated the rise of the worldâs next largest superpower, China. And together they made globalization more pervasive and the world more prosperous.
And then some changes too big to ignore set in. First, China under Xi announced a âMade in China 2025â modernization plan, promising subsidies to make Chinaâs private and state-owned companies the world leaders in supercomputing, A.I., new materials, 3-D printing, facial-recognition software, robotics, electric cars, autonomous vehicles, 5G wireless and advanced microchips.
This was a natural move for a China aiming to leap out of the middle-income ranks and to reduce its dependency on the West for high-tech. But all these new industries compete directly with Americaâs best companies.
As a result, all Chinaâs subsidies, protectionism, cheating on trade rules, forced technology transfers and stealing of intellectual property since the 1970s became a much greater threat. If the U.S. and Europe allowed China to continue operating by the same formula that it had used to grow from poverty to compete for all the industries of the future, weâd be crazy. Trump is right about that.
Where he is wrong is that trade is not like war. Unlike war, it can be a win-win proposition. Alibaba, UnionPay, Baidu and Tencent and Google, Amazon, Facebook and Visa can all win at the same time â and they have been. Iâm not sure Trump understands that.
But Iâm not sure Xi does, either. We have to let China win fair and square where its companies are better, but it has to be ready to lose fair and square, too. Who can say how much more prosperous Google and Amazon would be today if they had been able to operate as freely in China as Alibaba and Tencent can operate in America?
And how much money did China save â to subsidize its own companies â when its military stole the plans for Lockheed Martinâs F-35 stealth fighter and then made its own carbon copy, avoiding all the R & D costs?
I repeat: Trade can be win-win, but the winning shares can be distorted when one side is working hard and cheating at the same time. We could look the other way when trade was just about toys and solar panels, but when itâs about F-35s and 5G telecommunications, thatâs not smart.
But thatâs not all that is new and problematic. We now live in the age of âdual use.â In a dual-use world, âeverything that makes us powerful and prosperous also makes us vulnerable,â noted John Arquilla, one of the top strategists at the Naval Postgraduate School.
In particular, 5G equipment like that made by Chinaâs Huawei, which can transfer data and voices at hyperspeed, can also serve as an espionage platform, if Chinaâs intelligence services exercise their right under Chinese law to demand access.
Indeed, the controversy around Huawei shines a spotlight on this whole new moment: Huawei increasingly dominates the global market for 5G infrastructure, which used to be controlled by Ericsson and Nokia. Americaâs Qualcomm is both a supplier of chips and software to Huawei and a global competitor.
But the Chinese government has curbed competition against Huawei in China â by both foreign and Chinese companies â to enable Huawei to grow bigger, more quickly and cheaply. Huawei then uses that clout and pricing power to undercut Western telecoms and then uses its rising global market dominance to set the next generation of global 5G telecom standards around its own technologies, not those of Qualcomm or Swedenâs Ericsson.
Moreover, in a dual-use world, you have to worry that if you have a Huawei chatbot in your home, an equivalent of Amazonâs Echo, you could also be talking to Chinese military intelligence.
In the old days, when we were just buying Chinaâs tennis shoes and solar panels and it our soybeans and Boeings, who cared if the Chinese were Communists, Maoists, socialists â or cheats? But when Huawei is competing on the next generation of 5G telecom with Qualcomm, AT&T and Verizon â and 5G will become the new backbone of digital commerce, communication, health care, transportation and education â values matter, differences in values matters, a modicum of trust matters and the rule of law matters. This is especially true when 5G technologies and standards, once embedded in a country, become very hard to displace.
And then add one more thing: The gap in values and trust between us and China is widening, not narrowing. For decades, America and Europe tolerated a certain amount of cheating from China on trade, because they assumed that as China became more prosperous â thanks to trade and capitalist reforms â it would also become more open politically. That was happening until about a decade ago.
For the last decade, though, said James McGregor, one of the most knowledgeable U.S. business consultants in China and a longtime resident there, itâs been clear that Beijing, instead of âreforming and opening, has been reforming and closing.â
Instead of China getting richer and becoming more of a responsible stakeholder in globalization, it was getting richer and militarizing islands in the South China Sea to push the U.S. out. And it was using high-tech tools, like facial recognition, to become more efficient at authoritarian control, not less.
All of this is now coming to a head in these trade talks. Either the U.S. and China find a way to build greater trust â so globalization can continue apace and we can grow together in this new era â or they wonât. In which case, globalization will start to fracture, and weâll both be poorer for it.

Is It Too Late to Stop a New Cold War With China?,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244149294?accountid=14586,"George Orwell celebrated victory in World War II by warning that a âcold warâ would soon commence. A cold war, he wrote in his 1945 essay âYou and the Atomic Bomb,â was a âpeace that is no peace.â Nuclear weapons would prevent direct invasions, but the superpowers would otherwise lead irreconcilable world orders, each seeking to quarantine and trounce the other. Within a few years, the United States and the Soviet Union squared off in just this fashion. The American diplomat George Kennan forged Americaâs Cold War consensus by counseling that Soviet power had to be contained until it collapsed.
The Soviet Union did collapse, eventually. Orwell, however, had projected that a cold war might involve a third party: âEast Asia, dominated by China.â Until very recently, he looked mistaken. Since the 1970s, the United States and a rising China pursued economic enmeshment and a measure of diplomatic collaboration.
That was then. Now President Trump is escalating a trade war with China as politicians, policymakers and pundits from both parties urge him not to stop there. Senator Elizabeth Warren rejects Americaâs past âhappy faceâ China policy, and Senator Marco Rubio tweets about Chinaâs âcomprehensive plan to achieve world domination.â Washington is gearing up for full-spectrum competition with the worldâs No. 2 power. We may be witnessing the start of a Sino-American cold war.
If so, Mr. Trump may prove to be the next Harry Truman, who set the terms of the first Cold War in the late 1940s by pledging to âsupport free peoplesâ and creating institutions to integrate them. Mr. Trump is more severe: He vows vengeance upon those who ârape our countryâ and exacts it through sanctions and tariffs. That he is rallying the country bodes ill for the conflict to come, even compared with the nuclear standoffs, proxy wars and internal repression of the original Cold War. If responsible Americans would prefer a different future, now is the time to say so.
By the end of the Obama administration, officials in Washington feared China was straying from the path of liberalization and cooperation. They condemned Chinaâs legally dubious military buildup in neighboring seas. They criticized Chinaâs economic practices, which restricted market access for American businesses and forced them to divulge know-how. And they lamented Chinaâs authoritarian tightening under President Xi Jinping.
To be sure, these concerns â add to them Chinaâs human rights record, in particular its treatment of the Uighurs â are legitimate, just as were American objections to Soviet expansion and oppression in the 1940s. Still, as President Franklin Roosevelt had done toward the Soviets, President Barack Obama tried to challenge Chinese conduct more than Chinese power, and he emphasized the benefits of cooperation.
Only since Mr. Trump took office, and especially in the past year, has a Cold War-like panic seized Washington, elevating individual complaints about Chinese actions into all-encompassing opposition to Chinese power. While the president fixates on tariffs, his administration is drawing an âeconomic iron curtainâ across the world, as the former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson put it. America is crippling the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, whether to prevent espionage or deny China leadership of high-tech industries. Every issue â security, economics, technology, human rights â is fusing together.
Beijing must wonder what can satisfy Washingtonâs demands, beyond changing its regime or retreating from the world. We might find out from Vice President Mike Pence, who blasted Chinese âaggressionâ in an influential speech last October and is planning a follow-up, or from Kiron Skinner, who holds Mr. Kennanâs old post as director of policy planning at the State Department and who says she is formulating a Kennan-esque theory of the long âfightâ with China.
If a cold war is breaking out, why now? Although the United States and Soviet Union had different political and economic systems, their antagonism centered on a specific dispute: the future of postwar Germany. No single sticking point cleaves America and China today. Nor are ideological differences as acute. China no longer seeks the universal triumph of communism, and the United States is moving away from exporting democracy. Perhaps this should reassure us that relations will not descend into open conflict. Or perhaps the extent to which they already have indicates that a darker logic is at work.
The anti-China turn of the past year has been triggered more by American anxieties than by Chinese actions. The latter, by and large, are not new. What is new is President Trump, who has both introduced a distinctive animosity toward China and provoked the American political class to seek a new purpose for Americaâs global leadership.
Mr. Trump, a xenophobe, has for decades placed the blame for Americaâs problems on non-Western powers, first Japan in the 1980s and then China. His administration reflects this worldview. Ms. Skinner calls China a âreally different civilization.â âThis is the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian,â she has said, disregarding imperial Japan and Orientalized portrayals of the Soviets. Her point is nonetheless significant: If the original Cold War pitted liberal capitalist democracy against state communism, its successor may promise brute power politics wrapped around a clash of civilizations. No wonder Steve Bannon, doyen of the alt-right and Mr. Trumpâs former counselor, thunders that China poses âthe greatest existential threat ever faced by the United States.â
Mr. Trump has mattered in a second way. His election caused foreign-policy mandarins to panic over âisolationismâ and scramble to save American power. After banding together to defend the âliberal world order,â they have arrived at a surer solution: contain China. Beijing presents an ideal foil â a major adversary that justifies globe-spanning responses but doesnât pose much immediate threat of war. On Capitol Hill, getting tough on China ranks among the few causes that unite Democrats and Republicans. Economic nationalists imagine jobs returning to America, free-traders think pressure will open up China, and everyone gets to sound tough on defense. Todayâs climate reminds Senator Chris Coons of âthe 1950s when there was no downside, politically, to being anti-Soviet.â
That is not to say that China hawks are insincere or irrational. They are right that Chinaâs rise inherently threatens American interests â so long as America defines its interests as maintaining global dominance everywhere and forever. For advocates of the âUnited States-led liberal order,â what really counts is American leadership, even when supplied by Mr. Trump. In this respect, too, his presidency is clarifying.
At the moment, confrontation with China might seem to offer something for everyone, much as the anti-Soviet crusade initially promised. In the late 1940s, businesses saw an opportunity to expand trade and secure capitalism; organized labor signed on, agreeing to discipline its ranks for a slice of the economic pie. It seemed like a good bargain, at least until growth stalled and the Cold War turned out to mean dying in Vietnam.
The costs were immense then, and they could be steeper now. For one, it is no coincidence that a president who denies climate change is leading the charge against China, the top emitter of greenhouse gases. Arresting climate change requires America and China to cooperate and channel their competition into salvaging the planet rather than seizing its resources. The American people can live with an authoritarian China. They cannot live on an uninhabitable Earth.
Nor should the American people fear a Chinese military attack. Even in East Asia, Chinese forces are not about to displace American ones. The United States has time to assess Chinaâs ambitions and encourage its neighbors to defend themselves. Unremitting hostility may prove self-fulfilling, inducing China to seek to oust the United States military from the region. Although some think containing China offers a rationale for leaving the Middle East, they should think ahead: A new cold war could plunge the United States back into gruesome proxy wars around the world and risk a still deadlier war among the great powers.
Liberal hawks will say the survival of freedom is on the line. One wishes them luck: Having proved powerless to stop Mr. Trumpâs rise, they hope to control Chinaâs and bend what follows to their will. A cold war will more likely propel than diminish the forces of illiberalism. Demagogues like Mr. Trump will find it easy to swap the âred scareâ for the âyellow perilâ and accumulate power to keep the nation safe.
In 1946, Henry Wallace, President Trumanâs Commerce Secretary, cautioned that America should stop rearming and acquiring bases around the world. These actions would make the Soviets insecure, ensuring the conflict they meant to prevent. âTo other nations,â he counseled, âour foreign policy consists not only of the principles that we advocate but of the actions we take.â Mr. Truman asked Mr. Wallace to resign, and the superpowers launched the first Cold War. Will we avoid a second?

"As China Looms, Australiaâs Military Refocuses on Pacific Neighbors","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244151936?accountid=14586,"SYDNEY, Australia â For years, the graduating classes of Australiaâs military training programs studied Dari and Pashto, the languages of distant war-torn lands, eschewing the Bahasa and the Pijin of Asia-Pacific nations close to home.
But as Australian forces wind down their presence in Afghanistan and Iraq, where they have served alongside American troops since the early 2000s, they are renewing their focus on Australiaâs island neighbors, which have become a different kind of battleground as China seeks to expand its influence in the region.
Australia has always tried to maintain military forces near home strong enough to deter any potentially hostile power from moving into the South Pacific. But in recent decades, it has not faced such a challenge in the region, and instead has sent its troops again and again to support the United States in faraway conflicts.
Now, with Chinaâs rise, Australia faces a new calculation. On one side is the United States, with whom it has a formal military alliance. On the other is China, a country that is largely seen as crucial to Australiaâs economic future. China and the United States increasingly view each other as geopolitical rivals.
Beijingâs reach â and its challenge to Americaâs dominance in the Pacific â was on vivid display last week as three Chinese warships powered into Sydney Harbor, surprising many Australians.
It was not the first time China has made such a military visit, but it was larger than previous port calls. And the Australian government had kept the vesselsâ arrival secret, making no announcement beforehand. The timing raised eyebrows, too: The ships docked as the world outside China was marking the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison played it down as a âreciprocal visitâ and a sign of âthe relationship that we have.â National security experts, however, called it a show of force by China and a double-edged reminder of Australiaâs longstanding relationship with China and its growing military ambitions.
âNo Australian government is willing to risk relations with China by siding too overtly with Washington,â said Hugh White, emeritus professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University. âThis has become more and more clear as U.S. rivalry with China has become more overt.â
Mr. White said Australia had waning confidence that the United States â a reduced presence on the global stage under President Trumpâs America First policy â would prevail over China in their strategic contest.
âThatâs because China is far stronger than any previous rival, and America, especially under President Trump, looks weak and unreliable, despite the tough talk,â said Mr. White, who recently published a book titled âHow to Defend Australia.â
As part of its efforts to reacquaint itself with its neighbors, the Australian military just wrapped up an 11-week mission at sea during which its forces took part in exercises with counterparts in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and India.
Australiaâs defenders argue that it never fully left the region, and that its military partnerships endured wartime deployments. But John Blaxland, a military historian who is a professor at the Australian National University, said that âthereâs a recognition that we dropped the ball and we need to reinvest.â
The Australian military is scheduled to grow by several thousand members, to 62,000. Under a $62 billion program, Australia is building 54 naval vessels, including 12 attack-class submarines, which would double the size of the fleet. And it has purchased 72 F-35A joint strike fighter jets.
The trouble, said Sam Roggeveen, director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute, a research foundation in Sydney, is that âbecause the government insists on building all 12 new submarines at home, they will enter service too slowly â we wonât get the first one until the mid-2030s.â And, so far, just two of the F-35s have arrived in Australia.
When the Chinese ships sailed into Sydney Harbor, Mr. Morrison was engaged in a foreign policy exercise of his own. He was in the Solomon Islands, an ally in the Pacific, making his first foreign trip since his election last month and the first visit to that nation by an Australian prime minister since 2008.
The stopover was intended to signal that Mr. Morrisonâs conservative coalition will continue to make a priority of what it has been calling its Pacific step-up â an effort to increase engagement within the region.
Australian officials have spent the year visiting and bolstering ties with countries like the Solomons, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga. While in the Solomons, Mr. Morrison promised a $175 million investment in infrastructure in that country, where from 2003 to 2017 the Australian military was part of a peacekeeping effort that cost billions of dollars.
But the trip was not just a friendly get-together. China loomed over Mr. Morrisonâs every move.
The Solomons is one of six Pacific nations that have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, an island democracy that Beijing considers Chinese territory.
Chinaâs lack of formal relations with those nations has frustrated its efforts to expand its political and military clout in the region. The Solomons is feeling pressured to shift allegiance to China, its biggest trading partner. The countryâs leaders have said they are weighing such a move, as well as whether to sign on to Beijingâs global Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
Despite pressure from the United States, Mr. Morrison said he would not use his influence to try to ensure that the Solomons remained an ally of Taiwan. While the United States itself has formal diplomatic relations with China and not Taiwan, it sees a self-ruled Taiwan as a valuable check on China. Last week, the Trump administration said it would sell more than $2 billion in arms to Taiwan.
The Australian prime minister has also been determined not to weigh in on the deepening trade war between the United States and China, even as it emerged this month that the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs on Australian aluminum. The administration backed down amid pushback by the State Department and Pentagon officials, who feared damage to the military alliance with their most important ally in the Pacific.
At the same time, Australia has looked on with worry, and pushed back at times, as China has pursued a military buildup in the South China Sea aimed at asserting itself on matters of territory, navigation and resources.
As 1,200 Australian service members were conducting their recent outreach in the Asia Pacific, Australian warships were trailed by Chinese Navy vessels as they traversed the South China Sea. Australian pilots were also reportedly targeted with lasers while flying over the region; while initial suspicion fell on China, it was not clear who was behind the incident.
China now has the worldâs largest navy, and is able to field more vessels to more seas, even if its fleet is inferior to Americaâs. It has ventured into waters near Taiwan and Japan, and has drawn objections from Vietnam and the Philippines with territorial claims in the South China Sea.
It is attempting to build ports in Papua New Guinea, and is increasing surveillance around Manus Island, where the United States and Australia are developing a naval base.
Mr. White, the emeritus professor, said Australiaâs fears were compounded by doubts over whether the United States would fight China if pushed, or if it would withdraw from the region if it could not find a way to contain China.
âThis is a very hard question for Australians, because we can hardly imagine what it would be like to be without America as our major ally,â he said. âBut the unthinkable is now being thought about much more seriously than at any time since at least the end of the Vietnam War.â

A Muslim Family Sought Help at the Belgian Embassy in Beijing. The Police Dragged Them Out.,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2244139832?accountid=14586,"BEIJING â The last time Abdulhamid Tursun spoke to his wife, she was huddled in a Beijing hotel room with their four children, frightened after being evicted from the Belgian Embassy in the dead of night. Suddenly, plainclothes police officers burst into the room, cutting off the coupleâs video call.
Mr. Tursun says he has not heard from her since.
His wife, Wureyetiguli Abula, 43, had gone to the Belgian Embassy to seek visas so the family â from the Uighur Muslim minority group â could be reunited with Mr. Tursun, 51, in Brussels, where he won asylum in 2017.
But instead of finding protection, Ms. Abula and her children, ages 5 to 17, were dragged away after the Chinese police were allowed to enter the embassy.
Now the case is raising alarms back in Belgium, where lawmakers are asking how it could have happened and where Mr. Tursunâs family has been taken. It illustrates how, two years after China began detaining Uighurs in a vast network of internment camps, the group has limited protections â even from Western democracies â against persecution by the Chinese government.
Even Uighurs who make it to the West have not always been safe. Early last year, Germany mistakenly sent back to China a 22-year-old Uighur asylum seeker, who has not been heard from since.
On Monday, Belgium said it was sending a special envoy to Beijing to clarify the whereabouts of Mr. Tursunâs family. The Belgian government also said its ambassador in Beijing would try to secure passports for Ms. Abula and the children.
In Beijing, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, Lu Kang, said at a regularly scheduled news briefing on Tuesday that he had no knowledge of the case.
China has sent around one million Uighurs to internment camps in Xinjiang, the semiautonomous region in western China where most of them live. The figure is equivalent to about one-tenth of the regionâs Uighur population.
The government asserts that the Uighurs represent a terrorism threat to China and the world, an argument that is disputed by many Western nations, who see the internment effort as a systematic abuse of human rights. Some Uighurs who managed to leave the camps have told of being subjected to intense indoctrination under armed guard.
Uighurs outside the camps have seen their cities and homes turned into virtual prisons thanks to surveillance technology and a heavy military presence.
The Belgian Embassyâs handling of the case has come under criticism. Under international law, governments are obliged not to send people to countries where they are at substantial risk of being tortured, said Sarah H. Cleveland, a professor of law at Columbia University. Given that Ms. Abula and her children are Uighur, it was incumbent upon the Belgian Embassy to assess that risk, she said.
Ove Bring, a Swedish expert on human rights law, also said that Belgium appeared to have breached accepted standards of care. âBelgium could be criticized on grounds of international morality, having refused to offer humanitarian protection,â he said.
Since China intensified its crackdown in Xinjiang, some Western European countries have taken precautions to stop Uighurs who seek asylum from being sent back to China. Germany and Sweden said last year that they would refrain from deporting Uighurs.
Ms. Abula arrived in Beijing at the end of May, and on the advice of a nongovernmental organization in Belgium sought visas at the embassy that would allow the family to join Mr. Tursun in Brussels, where he works at an electronics company. He had been granted asylum in Belgium in late 2017 after his brother was arrested and placed in a detention camp.
The family group did not hold Chinese passports. But Mr. Tursun said his wife had been told by CAW, a Belgian group that helps immigrants, that along with the visas she and the children would each be issued a substitute travel document known as a laissez-passer.
At the embassy, Ms. Abula was told that the visas would take longer than she expected. Laissez-passer papers could not be issued because China does not recognize such documents, Matthieu Branders, the spokesman for the Belgian foreign ministry, said in response to written questions.
Scared and frustrated, Ms. Abula told embassy officials that she planned to remain on the grounds after their offices closed, according to Vanessa Frangville, a professor of Chinese studies in Brussels who has worked on the case.
When Ms. Abula settled into the front yard with her children, the staff complained that she was staging a âsit-in,â Mr. Branders said. They offered to drive her to her Beijing hotel in a diplomatic vehicle, he said. But Ms. Abula had already been harassed there by the police and was too afraid to return, Ms. Frangville said.
Soon after midnight on May 29, the police arrived at the embassy and disappeared inside, Mr. Tursun said, recounting what his wife and eldest daughter told him via the messaging app WeChat as events unfolded.
After about an hour, the police drove into the embassy yard, forced Ms. Abula and the children into the car and headed for a nearby police station, Mr. Tursun said.
It is unclear who called the police to the Belgian Embassy, who authorized them to enter, and who asked for Ms. Abula and her children to be removed. Asked on several occasions who let the police onto the embassy grounds, Mr. Branders declined to answer.
By midmorning that day, police officers from Xinjiang had taken charge of the family and transferred them back to the hotel, where they were left alone for a day.
Then on May 31, the plainclothes officers entered the room. âItâs you guys again,â Ms. Abula said, in Mr. Tursunâs recounting. She recognized them from the ordeal at the embassy, he said. Then her cellphone went dead.
Days later, Mr. Tursun learned through a friend that four male and three female police officers had guarded the family as they drove for about 30 hours across China back to their home in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.
His wife was now under house arrest, and the electronic equipment Mr. Tursun had left in the house had been confiscated by the police, the friend told him.
Upset that his familyâs plans had gone so awry, Mr. Tursun, accompanied by Ms. Frangville, met with Joseph Bockaert, the director of consular affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Brussels.
During the meeting, Mr. Tursun asked the Belgians to press the Chinese about what happened to his family, he said. At one point, Mr. Bockaert replied that Belgium was a small country and could not risk putting too much pressure on China, Ms. Frangville recalled.
âWe donât want to be in conflict with China,â Ms. Frangville quoted Mr. Bockaert as saying. Asked if Mr. Bockaert had made the comment, the spokesman, Mr. Branders, declined to answer.
Belgium has cultivated warmer economic and diplomatic relations with China in the past year. In December, the e-commerce giant Alibaba agreed to invest in logistics infrastructure in the country, a project involving a big lease at the LiÃ¨ge cargo airport, and the first of its kind for the Chinese company in Europe.
The roughly 200 Uighurs who live in Belgium are treated well, Ms. Frangville said, and asylum is granted to those who request it when they arrive.
But she said it was astonishing that the police in Beijing were allowed onto the embassy grounds.
âSomeone opened the door,â she said. âThe Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs wonât say who allowed them in. Why such a mystery?â

"U.S. Versus China: A New Era of Great Power Competition, but Without Boundaries","The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2248763383?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â When President Trump meets President Xi Jinping of China this week to discuss contentious trade issues, they will face each other in another nation that was once the United Statesâ main commercial rival, seen as a threat to American dominance.
But the competition between the United States and Japan, which hosts the Group of 20 summit this week for the first time, settled into a normal struggle among businesses after waves of American anxiety in the 1980s. Japan hit a decade of stagnation, and in 2010, China overtook it as the worldâs second-largest economy.
There is no sign, though, that the rivalry between the United States and China will reach the same kind of equilibrium. For one thing, Japan is a democracy that has a military alliance with the United States, while China is an authoritarian nation that most likely seeks to displace American military dominance of the western Pacific. In Chinaâs competition with the United States, a rancorous trade war has persisted for a year, and issues of national security are bleeding by the week into economic ones. Some senior American officials are pushing for âdecouplingâ the two economies.
[What is the G-20?]
The main elements in relations â economic and commercial ties â have become unmoored, and few agree on the future contours of the relationship or the magnitude of the conflicts.
For American officials, the stakes seem much higher now than in the race with Japan. Most economists estimate China will overtake the United States as the largest economy in 10 to 15 years. And some senior officials in Washington now view China as a steely ideological rival, where the Communist Party aims not only to subjugate citizens but to spread tools of authoritarian control globally â particularly surveillance, communications and artificial intelligence technology â and establish military footholds across oceans and mountains.
Though Mr. Trump incessantly praises Mr. Xi â he said they âwill always be friendsâ â the idea of China as a dangerous juggernaut, more formidable than the Soviet Union, has become increasingly widespread in the administration. It was articulated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a visit to the Netherlands, part of a weeklong trip across Europe this month in which he talked about China at each stop.
âChina has inroads too on this continent that demand our attention,â he told a news conference in The Hague. âChina wants to be the dominant economic and military power of the world, spreading its authoritarian vision for society and its corrupt practices worldwide.â
The National Security Strategy issued by the White House in December 2017 sounded the alarm: The United States was re-entering an era of great power competition, in which China and Russia âwant to shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and interests.â But since then, Mr. Trump and cabinet officials, distracted by Iran and other foreign policy matters, have failed to outline a coherent strategy.
That has left administration officials struggling to piece together an approach to China that has elements of competition, containment and constructive engagement, none of them sharply focused.
Mr. Trumpâs closest advisers on China are split on strategies. His top foreign policy officials, John R. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo, have pushed for tough policies, as has Peter Navarro, the trade adviser and creator of a polemical book and documentary film, âDeath by China.â In the opposite camp are tycoons â among them Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Stephen A. Schwarzman and Steve Wynn.
Midlevel bureaucrats are formulating their own ideas. The view of a drawn-out ideological conflict was laid out in stark terms by Kiron Skinner, the head of policy planning at the State Department, in a talk in Washington on April 29.
âThis is a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology, and the United States hasnât had that before,â she said. âThe Soviet Union and that competition, in a way, it was a fight within the Western family.â
Now, she said, âitâs the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.â
Many analysts have tried to discern whether the striking remarks point to a new policy direction. Officials say privately that is not the case.
While there has been bipartisan praise in Washington for the administrationâs tougher line â with measures ranging from tariffs to sanctions of Chinese technology companies â critics say they see strategic ambiguity without the strategy.
âThe economic and security and technological and even scientific components of the U.S.-China relationship are now being conflated,â said Jessica Chen Weiss, a professor of government at Cornell University who studies Chinese politics and nationalism. âWhatâs worrying to many is not being able to decipher different levels of risk and how far and how quickly the efforts to indiscriminately decouple the United States and China will go.â
That idea of decoupling rests on the premise that two economies so intertwined poses a significant security risk to the United States. The linking accelerated when China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 and in recent years had seemed irreversible. But Mr. Trumpâs hard-line trade advisers want the two nations to unwind their supply chains, which means some American businesses exit China, and others stop selling components to Chinese companies.
Mr. Trump is narrowly focused on cutting the trade deficit with China, which many economists say is not meaningful. But his imposition of tariffs and the general uncertainty around the economic relationship are forcing some American companies to rethink keeping operations in China. And putting Chinese companies, notably Huawei, the giant maker of communications technology, on what officials call an entity list to cut off the supply of American components is having an effect.
âAfter a long period of globalization and squeezing out economic efficiencies, you do see national security rising to the forefront,â said Daniel M. Kliman, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.
That has not gone unnoticed in China. This spring, with trade tensions rising, Chinese state-run television began showing old Korean War films depicting American aggression. Newspapers ran editorials on the war.
Wang Wen, executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China, said in an interview that the new model for United States-China relations was âfight but not break.â
The fallout from the struggle is widening. Chinese security officers have arrested two Canadian men on charges of spying in apparent retaliation for the arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, a top Huawei executive, on an extradition request by the United States. The F.B.I. has been canceling visas of Chinese scholars suspected of intelligence ties.
Some observers say they fear a new Red Scare.
âRather than proclaiming a âwhole of societyâ threat from a hostile âcivilization,â U.S. officials would be wise to emphasize the value that immigrants from China and other countries have brought, while establishing policies to safeguard against theft of intellectual property,â Ms. Weiss said.
The case of Huawei is at the nexus of concerns in Washington over both Chinese economic dominance and security threats. The Trump administration has been pushing countries to bar Huawei from developing next-generation 5G communications networks, arguing it poses a national security risk. Huawei, a private company, denies the charge.
But the reluctance of even close allies to adopt a ban, except for Australia, shows how nations are unwilling to jeopardize their economic relations with China. That includes Japan, where the government has not issued a ban and is trying to strengthen ties with China in other ways â at the G20 in Osaka, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe plans to host a dinner for Mr. Xi.
The Trump administration has also been pushing countries to reject Chinaâs Belt-and-Road infrastructure projects and what American officials call âdebt diplomacy,â with mixed results.
Some American companies are trying to bypass the limits set by the Trump administration on their dealings with China. Semiconductor companies, for example, have found a legal basis for sidestepping the Commerce Department prohibition on selling components to Huawei.
But the administration itself sometimes pulls punches on China in the name of economic relations â a sign that the traditional foundation of the relationship still stands to a degree.
Since last year, the administration has debated imposing sanctions on Chinese officials for their role in interning one million or more Muslims in the Xinjiang region. Though Mr. Pompeo and other officials have pushed for the sanctions, the Treasury Department, led by Mr. Mnuchin, has opposed them for fear of derailing the trade talks. So the administration has taken no action.
Chinaâs extraordinary human rights abuses in Xinjiang are one major reason many American officials have abandoned any notion of a future turn toward liberalism within the Communist Party.
For their part, Chinese officials have seized on the Trump administrationâs actions to argue that the United States is trying to stop Chinaâs rise. On Tuesday, Peopleâs Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, ran a commentary urging citizens to fight for the nationâs dignity.
âThe Chinese people deeply understand that the American governmentâs suppression and containment of China is an external challenge that China must bear in its development and growth,â the paper said, âand it is a hurdle that we must overcome in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.â

"Li Keqiang, Chinese Premier, Reaches Out to Trump and Business","The New York Times, Internationa l edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2251851152?accountid=14586,"DALIAN, China â A top Chinese leader made an unusually public effort on Tuesday to ease trade tensions somewhat with the United States, woo foreign investors and reassure his own countryâs citizens that their economy remained on track.
In meetings during the World Economic Forum in the Chinese port city of Dalian, Premier Li Keqiang, Chinaâs No. 2 official, promised to cut tariffs, loosen limits on foreign investment, protect intellectual property and allow foreign companies to apply for Chinaâs generous subsidies for research and development. He made many of those comments in a rare question-and-answer session in the afternoon with executives from Japan, the United States and other countries.
He also said that China would allow foreign financial services companies into its market a year earlier than previously promised, and that it would rewrite many rules on foreign investment.
âWe will move up the lifting of foreign capital limits in securities, futures and life insurance, from 2021 to 2020,â Mr. Li said in a morning speech, prompting a burst of applause from a crowd that appeared to include many bankers and others in finance. âThis shows Chinaâs commitment to opening up.â
Many of Mr. Liâs comments lacked details, and they recalled similarly vague promises made by Chinese officials in the past. Still, the timing suggested a willingness to appear conciliatory at a fraught time.
The Trump administration has imposed 25 percent tariffs on nearly half of Chinaâs exports to the United States, prompting a few companies to move operations elsewhere to supply the American market and causing many more companies to consider doing so. President Trump has urged companies to shift operations from China to the United States or elsewhere.
Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed at a meeting on Saturday during the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, that they would restart trade talks. But neither side made any mention of returning the negotiations to where they had been in early May, when the talks collapsed. That means high trade barriers will remain in effect with little sign of coming down anytime soon.
Mr. Liâs remarks to the foreign executives were the Chinese governmentâs most public effort so far to persuade them not to move supply chains out of China. In welcoming television cameras into the afternoon meeting, a rare move for a Chinese leader, he also sought to reassure the Chinese public that even if some supply chains were moved elsewhere, the Chinese economy would not be much affected.
âWhile investors relocate some parts of their production lines to other countries, they have also increased investment in other parts of production capacity here in China,â he said.
Even if China follows up on some or most of Mr. Liâs pledges, ending the trade war may require more dramatic action.
The collapse of trade negotiations in early May occurred mainly because Chinese negotiators, in essence, withdrew previous offers to amend many of the countryâs laws to reduce favoritism toward its homegrown businesses. The prospect of rewriting Chinese legislation in response to the demands of a foreign power had stirred a nationalistic backlash within the Chinese leadership and civil service.
The Trump administration has focused on persuading China to curtail lavish government subsidies to exporters and to companies that want to rival foreign firms in sectors like commercial aircraft, semiconductors and electric cars. The Trump administration contends that these policies create unfair, government-backed competitors for American companies and workers.
China has resisted putting limits on subsidies, which it regards as having been highly successful in building up its huge industries.
Chinaâs legislature approved a new legal code for foreign investment in March, giving the government a face-saving way to justify changes in other laws without appearing to acquiesce to American pressure. But the document approved by the legislature was only a few pages long and provided overarching goals, with few specifics.
Mr. Li said on Tuesday that regulations to put the new code into effect would be made public early next year. He promised that the new rules would make sure that foreign companies and Chinese companies were treated equally.
Over the weekend, China also slightly trimmed some of its many longstanding restrictions on foreign investment in specific industries.
American negotiators are likely to see these commitments as symbolic gestures rather than major shifts. The Trump administration has been less preoccupied with helping companies invest in China and more worried about increasing exports of American goods to the country.
Though Mr. Li pledged on Tuesday that China would lower tariffs, he offered no specifics. China has been reducing them over all in recent months, even as it was adding extra retaliatory tariffs on goods from the United States amid the trade war.
Chinaâs move on foreign financial services would allow international securities firms and insurers to control brokerages and other businesses in China. Currently, foreign firms are allowed only partial stakes. China pledged a year and a half ago to allow foreign firms more leeway.
Tim Stratford, a former American trade official who is now the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, expressed cautious optimism after Mr. Liâs speech that the Chinese government might make substantive changes.
âHeâs the head of a very large government, and the challenge is to transmit that vision through the whole government,â he said.
But Mr. Stratford noted that China had lost a World Trade Organization legal case in 2012, after not following through on a commitment it made when it joined the W.T.O. in 2001 to open its market to foreign credit cards. Chinaâs civil service is still working on regulations to let them in.
Mr. Li also made a carefully hedged promise that China would maintain the overall stability of its currency, the renminbi, and would not seek to devalue it so as to gain a competitive advantage in trade.
If the renminbiâs value declined against the dollar, that would make Chinese exports cheaper in terms of dollars and more competitive overseas, while making imports of foreign goods more expensive and less competitive within China. The United States Treasury has been putting pressure on China for many years not to devalue its currency, fearing the effects on trade competition as well as disruption of financial stability in China and some of its Asian neighbors.
But on Sunday, Mr. Trump unexpectedly spoke favorably of a modest decline in the value of the renminbi over the past year. He noted that the weakening of the renminbi had offset, for American consumers, some of the costs of his tariffs on Chinese goods.

Why China No Longer Needs Hong Kong,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2252528221?accountid=14586,"For many years after regaining control of Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, China mostly respected the territoryâs institutions. That is no longer the case, as Beijingâs heavy hand during the recent protests in the city has made obvious.
So what changed? In 1997, China needed Hong Kong. China had not yet been allowed to join the World Trade Organization, so Chinese exporters had limited access to the global market. Hong Kong was the solution: It served as a channel for entrepÃ´t trade â goods from China could enter the territoryâs ports and then be sent as exports from Hong Kong to the rest of the world, thus evading the trade restrictions imposed by member nations on nations outside the organization.
When China became part of the trade organization in 2001, entrepÃ´t trade through Hong Kong lost its importance. By some estimates, nearly half of Chinaâs trade went through Hong Kong in 1997, today that figure is less than 12 percent.
In terms of total size and wealth, Hong Kong has also shrunk relative to China, which has experienced more than three decades of astoundingly high economic growth. In 1997, Hong Kongâs economy was one-fifth the size of Chinaâs, and its per capita income was 35 times higher. By 2018, Hong Kongâs economy was barely one-thirtieth the size of Chinaâs. Hong Kong is still richer, but the gap is narrowing, with its per capita income now five times higher than Chinaâs.
In the period right after 1997, China wanted to strengthen Hong Kongâs reputation as an open and market-oriented economy governed by the rule of law. This was a large part of its appeal as a major international financial center, a status that benefited the mainland economy.
Hong Kong was also used as a controlled testing ground where Chinaâs currency, the renminbi, could find its feet as an international currency. Hong Kong had the trust of international investors, and the renminbi could trade more freely there than in China, where capital controls restricted the movement of financial capital across Chinaâs borders. Chinaâs dependence on Hong Kong is a thing of the past. The size of Chinaâs financial markets now dwarfs that of Hong Kongâs. Chinaâs four largest banks have become the four largest in the world in terms of their assets. In 1997, Chinaâs stock markets were barely half the size of Hong Kongâs stock markets. Today, the capitalization of Chinaâs stock markets stands at nearly $8 trillion, among the largest stock markets in the world, and about double that of Hong Kongâs.
It is not that Hong Kongâs markets have shrunk â the value of new public listings in Hong Kong was higher than any other exchange worldwide last year. Rather, it is simply that Chinaâs financial markets, like its economy, have expanded so fast they have left Hong Kong in the dust.
China now has enough clout that investors around the world are willing to overlook deficiencies in its corporate and public governance. The renminbi is on its way to becoming a significant international currency, with Hong Kong just one of many financial centers where trading in the currency is authorized. And China has ambitions of promoting Shanghai as an international financial center, which makes Hong Kong a rival.
In short, China no longer needs Hong Kong the way it once did.
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis and with political upheaval facing the United States and other major democracies, China has come to envision an entirely different purpose for Hong Kong. It is to show that its vision of rule by the Communist Party, with some economic freedoms but restrictions on political and social freedom, might be preferable to the chaos of liberal Western democracies. Beijing also wants to use Hong Kong to showcase the efficacy of Chinaâs version of the rule of law, in which the legal system serves the economy by enforcing property and contractual rights but is ultimately subservient to the Communist Party.
The troubles in Hong Kong go directly counter to Beijingâs narrative that its citizens are more than willing to give up personal and political freedom so long as the government delivers stable economic growth and maintains law and order. And Beijingâs actions there, including a controversial extradition bill, could eventually undermine international investorsâ confidence in Hong Kongâs legal system. But the economic consequences for Beijing are modest, especially relative to the benefits of making a clear political point.
China may briefly loosen its chokehold on Hong Kong. But there is no mistaking Beijingâs plans for Hong Kong, which do not include preserving what its people and international investors once cherished â the value placed on free enterprise along with democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law. The protesters are right to fear whatâs coming.

A New Red Scare Is Reshaping Washington,"The New York Times, International edition; New York",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2261978355?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON â In a ballroom across from the Capitol building, an unlikely group of military hawks, populist crusaders, Chinese Muslim freedom fighters and followers of the Falun Gong has been meeting to warn anyone who will listen that China poses an existential threat to the United States that will not end until the Communist Party is overthrown.
If the warnings sound straight out of the Cold War, they are. The Committee on the Present Danger, a long-defunct group that campaigned against the dangers of the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s, has recently been revived with the help of Stephen K. Bannon, the presidentâs former chief strategist, to warn against the dangers of China.
Once dismissed as xenophobes and fringe elements, the groupâs members are finding their views increasingly embraced in President Trumpâs Washington, where skepticism and mistrust of China have taken hold. Fear of China has spread across the government, from the White House to Congress to federal agencies, where Beijingâs rise is unquestioningly viewed as an economic and national security threat and the defining challenge of the 21st century.
âThese are two systems that are incompatible,â Mr. Bannon said of the United States and China. âOne side is going to win, and one side is going to lose.â
The United States and China have been locked in difficult trade negotiations for the past two years, with talks plagued by a series of missteps and misunderstandings. Mr. Trump has responded to the lack of progress by steadily ratcheting up American tariffs on Chinese goods and finding other ways to retaliate. China has responded in kind.
The two sides now appear far from any agreement that would resolve the administrationâs concerns about China, including forcing American companies operating there to hand over valuable technology. Even if a deal is reached, the two sides are busy constructing broader economic barriers.
In addition to placing a 25 percent tariff on roughly half of the goods China exports, the United States has restricted the kinds of technologies that can be exported to China, tried to cut off some Chinese companies, like telecom giant Huawei, from purchasing American products and rolled out hurdles for Chinese investment in the United States.
American intelligence agencies have also ratcheted up efforts to combat Chinese espionage, particularly at universities and research institutions. Officials from the F.B.I. and the National Security Council have been dispatched to Ivy League universities to warn administrators to be vigilant against Chinese students who may be gathering technological secrets from their laboratories to pass to Beijing.
The administration paints the crackdown as necessary to protect the United States. But there are growing concerns that it is stoking a new red scare, fueling discrimination against students, scientists and companies with ties to China and risking the collapse of a fraught but deeply enmeshed trade relationship between the worldâs two largest economies.
âIâm worried that some people are going to say, because of this fear, any policy is justifiable,â said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. âThe climate of fear that is being created needs to help generate the conversation, not end the conversation.â
Anti-China sentiment has spread quickly, with Republicans and Democrats, labor union leaders, Fox News hosts and others warning that Chinaâs efforts to build up its military and advanced industries threaten Americaâs global leadership, and that the United States should respond aggressively. Skepticism has seeped into nearly every aspect of Chinaâs interaction with the United States, with officials questioning Chinaâs presence on American stock markets, its construction of American subway cars and its purchase of social media networks.
Yet there is little agreement on what America can or should do. The United States has tried for decades to entice and cajole China to become a more open society, but the Communist Party has steadily tightened its grip over the Chinese people and the economy. American leaders now face a choice of whether to continue down a path of engagement that could leave the country vulnerable to economic and security threats â or embark on a path of disengagement that could weaken both economies and might one day even lead to war.
An increasing number of people in Washington now view the decoupling of the two economies as inevitable â including many of the members of the Committee on the Present Danger. At an inaugural meeting in April, Mr. Bannon, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and others issued paeans to Ronald Reagan â a former member of the group â and were met with standing ovations as they called for vigilance against China.
They praised Mr. Reaganâs Cold War victory over the Soviet Union and his doctrine of âpeace through strength,â but there was also an air of inevitability that war might come, only this time with China.
Mr. Bannon was just off the plane from Rome, with a slight shadow of a mustache and his silver hair brushed back. Clad in a black button-down and long black suit jacket, he thumped the podium as he described China as a rising power and the United States as a declining power that would inevitably clash.
âThis is the defining event of our time, and 100 years from now, this is what theyâre going to remember us for,â he said.
The committeeâs two earliest iterations, in the 1950s and again in the 1970s, called for an arms buildup to counter the Soviets. The second iteration, formed over a luncheon table at Washingtonâs Metropolitan Club in 1976, issued documents warning against Soviet expansionism, with titles like âIs America Becoming Number 2?â
The group reached the height of its influence during the Reagan administration, in which dozens of its members eventually held posts, including as the national security adviser and C.I.A. director. But as the Soviet threat faded, so did the committee.
The group was briefly active again starting in 2004, this time to warn against the threat of Islamic extremism. The committeeâs vice chair, Frank Gaffney, is the founder of the Center for Security Policy, a think tank that argues that mosques and Muslims across America are engaged in a âstealth jihadâ to âIslamizeâ the country by taking advantage of American pluralism and democracy.
The groupâs activity largely died down until concern over China rekindled interest.
Todayâs committee acknowledges that the threat from China is different from Soviet Russia because the American and Chinese economies are much more integrated. But Washington is increasingly reaching back into the Cold War toolbox to confront the threat.
The administration has placed Chinese tech companies on an âentity list,â essentially blacklisting them from doing business with American firms. In keeping with a law passed last year, the administration has increased its checks of Chinese investment, including of minority stakes in American companies. Last June, the administration began restricting visas for Chinese graduate students in sensitive research fields like robotics and aviation. And the United States has begun barring Chinese academics from the United States if they are suspected of having links to Chinese intelligence agencies.
âTheyâre not the Soviet Union. But this kind of government control, statism, never works for long,â Larry Kudlow, the White House chief economic adviser, said in a July 16 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group. The possibility that China could collapse like the Soviet Union has âalways been an undercurrentâ in the trade war, he said.
The new Cold War has not been one-sided. Many of the changes in Washington have been triggered by a darker turn in Beijing.
China has increased its scrutiny of American firms, and many American companies and their employees in China now fear reprisal. In addition to detaining millions of Chinese Muslims, democracy activists and others, Chinese authorities have jailed foreign diplomats, academics and businesspeople â prompting some to cancel or delay trips to China.
China is also projecting its power abroad, funding global infrastructure and constructing an archipelago of artificial islands with giant air bases reaching almost to the shores of Malaysia and Indonesia. Beijing has made it clear that it intends to help its companies dominate the industries of the future, from artificial intelligence and supercomputers to aerospace equipment. Its policies have sought to replace imports of high-tech products with Chinese-made goods, pressuring multinationals to move factories from the United States and resulting in the loss of American jobs.
China has rejected entreaties by the Trump administration to curb these activities, arguing that it is simply pursuing its own economic development. In an interview after trade talks broke down in May, Liu He, Chinaâs top negotiator, said that areas of disagreement between the United States and China focused on âmajor matters of principleâ on which China was unlikely to bend.
The chill in relations has begun to weigh on Chinese investment in the United States, along with Chinese students and tourism. Chinese investment in American residential and commercial real estate has begun to decline. Companies are increasingly diversifying away from China, wary of the presidentâs ongoing economic war.
Nintendo, GoPro, Hasbro and other companies are reconsidering factories in China, choosing to source products from Vietnam, the United States, Mexico and India instead.
Susan Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California at San Diego, said the United States is at risk of being gripped by âan anti-Chinese version of the Red Scareâ that is driving Chinese talent away and could rupture what little good will is left between the two countries.
âWeâve made this mistake once before, during the Cold War,â Ms. Shirk said. âAnd I donât think we should make it again.â
Chinese nationals and Americans of Chinese heritage say they have felt the chilling effects. Some suspect they are being passed over for promotions and grants. Supporters of engagement have been dismissed as apologists or even traitors.
âChinese Americans feel targeted,â said Charlie Woo, chief executive of Megatoys and a member of the Committee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese-Americans. âAnd thatâs really hurtful.â
The Trump administration and the Committee on the Present Danger have been careful to say their targets are the Chinese government and the Communist Party, not the Chinese people. But the distinction can be a difficult one to make. In the rush to protect against new threats from China, the line between preparedness and paranoia is sometimes unclear.
At a Senate hearing last year, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said the Trump administration was trying to âview the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat,â adding, âI think itâs going to take a whole-of-society response by us.â
Many Chinese people and their defenders have bristled at the implication that the entire Chinese society poses a national security threat.
Toby Smith, vice president for policy at the Association for American Universities, said that American universities were working hard to remain vigilant to espionage threats, but that they thrive on openness and access to talent and science from around the world â including from China.
âThe situation with China is different than the Cold War,â he said. âThe concern with the Soviet Union was primarily military. Now itâs a concern about economic competitiveness.â

"China tries to boost its economy, as long trade fight looms with Trump: Â  Administration officials think they can drive China to make concessions by inflicting tariff pain. But tariffs are only a small part of Chinaâs economic woes.","The Washington Post (Online); Washington, D.C.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2117053537?accountid=14586,"China is redoubling efforts to protect its slowing economy from the effects of a trade war with the United States, providing fresh ammunition for President Trump's claim that Washington enjoys the upper hand in the deepening commercial conflict.
The modest slowdown stands in contrast to the surging U.S. economy, which boasts an unemployment rate near half-century lows.
The president in recent weeks has brushed off Chinese calls for negotiations over the trade dispute, labeling Beijing's offers as inadequate and saying the time is not yet right to deal.
The Chinese moves to boost growth are seen at the White House as evidence that the president's hard-nosed approach will pay dividends if the administration keeps its nerve and Chinese officials come to recognize the cost of their refusal to change course.
""President Trump's team estimates there's more analytical work to be done in Beijing about the long-term damage this could cause,"" said Michael Pillsbury, director of the center on Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute and an occasional White House adviser.
Chinese officials, meanwhile, appear to be chafing under Washington's inflexible approach. Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday clashed in Beijing with visiting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, accusing the United States of ""constantly escalating trade friction toward China.""
The diplomatic tensions follow several months of dueling trade actions. Starting in May, Trump imposed two major rounds of tariffs affecting roughly half the $505 billion in Chinese goods the United States imports each year. China fired back with import levies designed to cause the president and his Republican allies political pain by hitting his supporters, especially in the farm belt.
Even as Trump administration officials take credit for Beijing's distress, economists say China's biggest problem is debt, not tariffs.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, China has cut by one-third its dependence on trade to drive growth. Instead, it's relied on easy credit. Beijing doubled the size of its economy over the past decade â but it needed to quadruple its banking system, adding $29 trillion worth of new loans, to do so, according to a study by Logan Wright and Dan Rosen of the Rhodium Group.
""The most important levers really driving the economy are credit growth rather than exports,"" said Wright.
The Chinese central bank, the People's Bank of China, on Sunday reduced the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve for the fourth time in 2018, freeing up $174 billion for new loans. Along with tax cuts Beijing announced earlier this year, the move is designed to shield the Chinese economy from tariff pain.
China grew at an annual rate of 6.7 percent in the second quarter and is on track to meet the government's full-year growth target. But in recent weeks several signs of economic weakness have emerged, including the worst new export orders data in two years, lagging consumer spending and rising corporate bond defaults.
""The trade war has certainly worsened an already difficult situation that the Chinese government was facing,"" said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and a former head of the International Monetary Fund's China unit.
Chinese authorities are gambling that the government can stimulate growth without tipping the heavily indebted financial system into crisis, economists said.
Easing monetary policy puts China out of sync with the Federal Reserve, which is expected to continue raising its benchmark rate several times next year, and will erode the effect of Trump's tariffs by effectively discounting the price of Chinese exports to the United States, said Wright, Rhodium's director of China markets research.
The Chinese yuan already has lost nearly 10 percent of its value against the dollar since mid-April.
By spurring growth, however, the People's Bank of China is delaying efforts to wean the $14 trillion economy from its dangerous addiction to debt. Chinese authorities since 2016 have cut the rate of growth in credit by half, but the stockpile of outstanding debt continues to swell.
""It's more proof that growth is slowing and China is worried,"" said Stephanie Segal, a former U.S. Treasury Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Trump in recent weeks has pointed to the year-long drop in the Chinese stock market and the slowing of the economy as signs that the United States is winning the trade war. ""They are under pressure to make a deal with us,"" the president tweeted last month, referring to Chinese officials. ""Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing.""
Indeed, the Shanghai composite has lost 23 percent of its value this year. Vice President Pence, in a speech last week at the Hudson Institute, said American investment was responsible for much of China's economic development over the past several decades, and he accused Beijing of unfair trade practices.
Trump's campaign to compel China to change its system of state subsidies and limits on foreign involvement was ""in large part"" responsible for the Chinese stock market decline, Pence said.
But the Chinese stock market is driven more by financial speculation than by developments in the real economy. The current economic slowdown, though perhaps somewhat quicker than expected, was planned by Chinese officials.
After borrowing heavily to rescue the economy during the 2008 crisis, China confronts a debt bill topping 240 percent of its economic output. Under President Xi Jinping, banks have funneled too much new credit to inefficient state-owned enterprises rather than to the private sector, meaning China is getting less bang for every buck of new lending.
It now takes more than three times as much new debt to produce a given amount of output as it did a decade ago, according to a January study from the IMF.
""International experience suggests that such rapid credit growth is not sustainable and is typically associated with a financial crisis and/or a sharp growth slowdown,"" the IMF warned after examining 43 historical examples of countries that had binged on credit.
To put the economy on sound footing, Chinese officials realize that they need to ""deleverage,"" or cut debt. That will inevitably slow the pace of growth.
""What's hitting the Chinese economy the most is deleveraging,"" said David Loevinger, managing director for emerging markets at TCW, an asset management firm. ""Trade is a head wind to growth, but it's not as fierce as the deleveraging head wind.""
Trump vowed last month to impose levies on all Chinese imports if Beijing refuses to abandon trade practices he considers predatory, including a requirement that U.S. companies surrender trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market, and the theft of intellectual property from American companies.
But Xi has dug in his heels, pledging to boost domestic industries, increase exports and pour billions of dollars into infrastructure projects.
Chinese authorities aimed to project calm Monday as they moved to stimulate the economy. ""Although some economic indicators eased slightly in August, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain unchanged and it remains on the track of fast and stable growth,"" said an editorial in the state-owned China Daily newspaper.
Investors, though, appeared startled Monday, with the Shanghai composite falling nearly 4 percent, its biggest drop since June.
The market plunge defied China's year-long campaign to maintain public confidence as Trump's threats mount, said Elizabeth Economy, director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Officials insist that Trump's tariffs will have a ""negligible"" impact on the economy next year as China prioritizes other export markets, particularly Europe.
But ""there is no way to read this move as other than a sign of weakness in the Chinese economy,"" said Economy, referring to the central bank's action. ""That's precisely the message the government is trying to avoid.""

"U.S. Criticizes China's Currency Practices, but Doesn't Add Manipulator Designation; Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says China's practices are a source of 'particular concern'","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2121076608?accountid=14586,"The U.S. Treasury again passed up a formal opportunity to designate China a ""currency manipulator,"" but singled out the nation's currency practices as a source of ""particular concern.""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin faulted China's ""lack of currency transparency and the recent weakness in its currency,"" saying in a statement that this poses ""major challenges to achieving fairer and more balance trade, and we will continue to monitor and review China's currency practices.""
Though it passed on calling China a manipulator, the Treasury kept China and five other nations on a formal ""monitoring list,"" in its semiannual report on foreign-exchange policies of major U.S. trading partners. The report is the official vehicle for making a declaration that a country has manipulated its currency to obtain an unfair trading advantage.
This is now the fourth of the semiannual reports in which the Trump administration has declined to apply the manipulator designation to Beijing. The reason for restraint, the Treasury said, is that China hasn't intervened significantly in its currency markets in recent quarters. Actual intervention is one of the key criteria for meeting the manipulation threshold.
China, along with Germany, India, Japan, South Korea and Switzerland, remain on the formal monitoring list. The Treasury uses it to place countries on notice that their currency practices have put the U.S. at an unfair disadvantage and that they could be close to triggering action from the Treasury.
The result was largely expected. While President Trump has threatened to label China a currency manipulator, the laws governing the report require countries to meet three thresholds to receive the designation: persistently intervening in currency markets; running a significant trade surplus with the U.S.; and running a large current-account surplus overall. No country currently meets all three criteria. China, for example, runs a modest overall trade surplus, even though it runs a large one with the U.S.
If a country is faulted for currency manipulation, negotiations are required over its trade practices and it could be hit with tariffs.
The designation itself would be largely symbolic if applied against China, because the U.S. is already cracking down on its trade practices. The U.S. has applied tariffs to about $250 billion worth of Chinese imports and is threatening to roughly double that count.
Mr. Mnuchin said over the weekend that currency issues would have to be a part of any U.S.-China trade talks.
The People's Bank of China, for its part, vowed over the weekend to refrain from any competitive devaluations of its currency. Cheapening a currency helps a country's trade position by making its exports cheaper abroad and increasing the cost of imports.
China has had a long history in the past of taking steps to depress its exchange rate, thereby making its exports cheaper, undercutting its international competitors, and boosting its manufacturing industry. Since a 2015 law passed boosting U.S. scrutiny of currency practices, China has largely refrained from actively intervening in its currency market.
China has both purchased and sold foreign currency in the past 12 months. The Treasury estimates that China's net purchases of foreign currency amounted to less than 0.1% of its gross domestic product.
Of the five other nations on the list, none violate all three of Treasury's criteria. Germany, South Korea and Japan haven't made large currency interventions. Switzerland does intervene, but doesn't have a large trade surplus with the U.S.
India doesn't have a trade surplus all with the U.S. and, while it had intervened in its currency markets in the past, this intervention has largely reversed over the past 6 months. The Treasury said that India now only meets one of the three triggers for currency actions and that India would be removed from the monitoring list in six months if that remains the case.
The designation comes as Washington and Beijing are starting to get ready for a meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group-of-20 leaders meeting in Buenos Aires at the end of November. It is far from clear how substantive such a meeting will be or whether it will have any impact on the ongoing U.S. China trade fight.
The U.S. has imposed 10% tariffs on the last round of $200 billion of Chinese goods hit by levies--about equal to the amount that the yuan has devalued since March when the U.S. began starting to seriously threaten tariffs. Those levies are set to rise to 25% on Jan. 1--a level at which U.S. businesses reliant on Chinese imports say they will begin to feel substantial pain. The G-20 meeting is seen as the last point at which Mr. Xi could convince Mr. Trump to delay the tariff rise.

Mr. Mnuchin said over the weekend that currency issues would have to be a part of any U.S.-China trade talks.
The People's Bank of China, for its part, vowed over the weekend to refrain from any competitive devaluations of its currency. Cheapening a currency helps a country's trade position by making its exports cheaper abroad and increasing the cost of imports.
China has had a long history in the past of taking steps to depress its exchange rate, thereby making its exports cheaper, undercutting its international competitors, and boosting its manufacturing industry. Since a 2015 law passed boosting U.S. scrutiny of currency practices, China has largely refrained from actively intervening in its currency market.
China has both purchased and sold foreign currency in the past 12 months. The Treasury estimates that China's net purchases of foreign currency amounted to less than 0.1% of its gross domestic product.
Of the five other nations on the list, none violate all three of Treasury's criteria. Germany, South Korea and Japan haven't made large currency interventions. Switzerland does intervene, but doesn't have a large trade surplus with the U.S.
India doesn't have a trade surplus all with the U.S. and, while it had intervened in its currency markets in the past, this intervention has largely reversed over the past 6 months. The Treasury said that India now only meets one of the three triggers for currency actions and that India would be removed from the monitoring list in six months if that remains the case.
The designation comes as Washington and Beijing are starting to get ready for a meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group-of-20 leaders meeting in Buenos Aires at the end of November. It is far from clear how substantive such a meeting will be or whether it will have any impact on the ongoing U.S. China trade fight.
The U.S. has imposed 10% tariffs on the last round of $200 billion of Chinese goods hit by levies--about equal to the amount that the yuan has devalued since March when the U.S. began starting to seriously threaten tariffs. Those levies are set to rise to 25% on Jan. 1--a level at which U.S. businesses reliant on Chinese imports say they will begin to feel substantial pain. The G-20 meeting is seen as the last point at which Mr. Xi could convince Mr. Trump to delay the tariff rise.

Talk Is Cheap for China's Economy--and Stocks; China's economy expanded just 6.5% in the third quarter. Investors shouldn't expect any white knights,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2122316218?accountid=14586,"Fund managers love to ""talk their book,"" waxing poetic about their portfolio's fortunes. Financial regulators usually refrain--except, that is, in China.
Ahead of disappointing third-quarter figures released Friday that showed the Chinese economy grew at 6.5% --its slowest rate since 2009--the head of the country's central bank, securities and banking regulators took to state media to emphasize the financial system's stability, how cheap stocks look, and Beijing's recent measures to support struggling companies. The Shanghai Composite, which had opened down 1%, was up 0.25% by early afternoon. When Xi Jinping's economics czar Liu He later added further reassuring comments, the market surged again, finishing up 2.6% for the day.
Job done? Not exactly. Chinese equities still do look cheap, with Shanghai stocks trading at 12 times trailing earnings, around their lowest level since 2014. But even if Beijing follows up Friday morning's jawboning with concrete measures to boost the economy, it may not help much in reversing this year's 23% slump in Shanghai stocks.
Chinese market watchers will note a well-established recent pattern. Regulators make splashy announcements on supporting growth and markets rally--but when only a moderate stimulus arrives, stocks soon resume their selloff . That happened July 24, after China's cabinet released a strong statement on ensuring ""abundant liquidity"" and supporting cash-strapped local governments. It happened again Sept. 18 after a big government press conference on supporting investment. The Shanghai Composite is now 15% below its late July level and 10% below its late September level. China-sensitive copper prices have also struggled to hold late summer gains.
There are good reasons why Beijing's big bazooka remains holstered. Things are still not that bad in China . Exports are strong and the housing market is bubbly. Retail sales weakened marginally in real terms in September, but the slowdown has ebbed since July. Investment in the critical property sector is holding up too: year-over-year growth in cement, glass and steel production all accelerated or held steady last month, with the latter growing its fastest since June. The main dark spots are weak infrastructure investment and faltering price gains for indebted industrial firms.
A big stimulus would also be risky with consumer prices rebounding, the yuan under pressure, and the Federal Reserve in hawkish mode. Beijing will keep supporting growth at the margins--further fiscal stimulus is definitely coming , and the central bank will likely pump more liquidity into markets by lowering banks' reserve requirements again. But unless exports and producer prices deteriorate much further--and the housing market starts wobbling--investors shouldn't expect Chinese regulators to come bearing many more gifts.

Can Tesla Drive Out of the Slow Lane in China? The electric car company has suffered amid U.S.-China trade tensions. Its plan to go local in China faces some stiff obstacles.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2122335551?accountid=14586,"Tesla is stuck in traffic in China. Its plan to move into the fast lane may not go smoothly.
The electric car maker has been one of the biggest victims of China-U.S. trade tensions, ever since Beijing raised the tariff on cars imported from the U.S. to 45% from 25% in July. Unlike many American car makers that have factories in China, Tesla's cars are made solely in the U.S. That means a Tesla sold in China is around 60% more expensive than one sold back home. Tesla vehicle imports into China dropped from around 1,500 a month in the first half to around 260 a month on average in July and August, according to data collected by JL Warren Capital.
To drive around that pothole, Tesla plans to build its first factory in China--its second-largest market, accounting for around 17% of sales last year. The auto maker bought a 210-acre plot in Shanghai this week to build a factory it says could eventually produce up to 500,000 cars a year . In turn, Tesla could become the first foreign car maker to have a wholly owned factory in China.
First it will need to find some cash . Tesla boss Elon Musk said in August that the Chinese factory will cost around $2 billion, though Goldman Sachs, for example, reckons total costs could amount to $4 billion to $5 billion. Tesla will need to raise that cash on top of refinancing $4.3 billion of its existing borrowings coming due by 2020.
Tesla expects what it calls ""local debt"" to fund much of the initial investment in its China plant, although who those local lenders might be is unclear. The Chinese government, which is eager to push its own electric-vehicle industry, may be interested in chipping in. It could, though, demand a steep price, such as forcing Tesla to transfer some of its technology.
Assuming everything works out--a big assumption for a company that has had myriad difficulties ramping up production at home --the Tesla factory still may not start operating for two to three years. Meanwhile, Tesla will continue to suffer from higher Chinese tariffs while its competitors play catch-up. China is already the world's largest EV market , with many domestic car makers able to produce low-end models.
Tesla has a long road ahead to reach its destination in China.

"Exports Keep China's Economy Warm, but Winter Is Coming; As China's overall growth rate slows, exports have been a driver--so far","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2122517803?accountid=14586,"GUANGZHOU, China--As China's economic growth weakens faster than expected and uncertainty from the trade fight with the U.S. casts a shadow over business, a surprising driver has been exports. But that may soon peter out.
American clients of Ningbo Frank Electric Co., a Chinese manufacturer of kettles and other household appliances, have been placing orders several months in advance, salesman John Zheng said. ""It all looks so good at the moment,"" he said. ""But it won't continue.""
China released a gloomy report card Friday on its economy's performance, with the rate of economic growth sliding to 6.5% in the third quarter, the slowest pace since the global financial crisis. Just ahead of the release--and after Chinese stocks fell 3% Thursday, taking losses to nearly 25% since the start of the year--the country's top financial regulators all came out with comments to calm investors.
The rare joint effort was followed up by an interview published by the official Xinhua News Agency with China's economic czar, Vice Premier Liu He, who played down the impact of the trade conflict and suggested low stock prices represent a buying opportunity.
""It shows how concerned they are about the economic outlook and the bearishness across the market,"" said Zhou Hao, senior emerging-markets economist at Commerzbank.
For months, China's economy has been trending down , with a variety of measures including fixed assets, car sales and retail sales slackening. Meanwhile, firms have been gearing up for U.S. tariffs on Chinese products to hit their bottom lines. That doesn't appear to have happened yet, as U.S. firms have piled up purchases ahead of the tariffs. The usual burst in orders ahead of the American holiday season has also helped.
Chinese exports grew at an average monthly pace of 11.7% during the third quarter, buoying the economy's weak performance. ""Thanks to frontloading, negative impact from the trade conflict with the U.S. is limited so far,"" said Grace Ng, an economist with J.P. Morgan.
But Washington has said it will raise tariff rates on some $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% next year, from the current 10%, and is threatening to impose tariffs on an additional $257 billion of Chinese products. Analysts say it is only a matter of time before the rush of advance orders fizzles and clients begin canceling purchases all together.
Macquarie Capital Ltd. estimates that Chinese export growth will decelerate to between 5% and 10% in the coming months. J.P. Morgan's Ms. Ng predicts exports will start weakening in 2019, knocking overall economic growth to as low as 6.1% next year.
At the annual China Import and Export Fair in the southern city of Guangzhou this week, thousands of Chinese vendors showed off their wares, including electrical appliances, lighting, building materials and hardware. Prospective vendors flooded the exhibition halls of the Canton Fair, as it is known, suggesting health for global trade yet.
But many Chinese firms that rely on the U.S. market are worried about difficult days ahead. American clients of RainMin Illumination Ltd., a manufacturer of LED bulbs that appear in light installations on display at SeaWorld theme parks and festivals such as Burning Man and Coachella, were pushing back orders and emailing to discuss whether the firm will lower its prices.
""It's the biggest challenge since we set up 15 years ago, even bigger than the 2008 crisis,"" said Liu Xiaoyan, one of the firm's managers.
Mr. Liu eagerly exchanged business cards with prospective buyers from India, although once they left he lamented that their market isn't developed enough to demand the sort of huge installation projects the firm's LED bulbs serve. ""It's impossible this time around.""
At a booth selling wine refrigerators, Lu Tao worried that revenues of his family business could fall up to 40% this year. He said he is planning to start selling directly to U.S. consumers on Chinese e-commerce website Taobao, cutting out American distributors. The higher prices he could charge would make up for the tariff costs. ""A fridge I sell for $300 now can go for $1000,"" Mr. Lu said.
Analysts expect Chinese leaders to move to prop up growth should exports, investment or consumption weaken too much. Keeping the economy at a steady and relatively fast pace is seen as crucial for the Communist Party to maintain social stability. Beijing has time and again stimulated the economy through fiscal and monetary measures, and in recent months has given financial markets more liquidity, while letting the Chinese yuan depreciate to assist Chinese exporters. Policy makers have also successfully urged local governments to issue more bonds, in the hope they will spend on projects again.
Chinese and American businesses are maneuvering to soften the blow of the trade fight. At the export fair, some Chinese vendors said they could make up for some reduction in U.S. orders by selling to other countries. Others boasted that their clients were already thinking about ways to reroute shipping via Taiwan, Mexico and other places not subject to higher U.S. tariffs. A common pitch: China remains No. 1 in the world at delivering well-made products at competitive prices.
Still, analysts say China's economy can't avoid the headwinds as the trade fight chips away at business confidence. They aren't optimistic that tensions between the two countries will ease, even as President Xi Jinping and President Trump prepare to meet at the end of November.
Sandi Kegebein had traveled to Guangzhou from Wisconsin in the hunt for Chinese products for her sourcing company, SC Global Sourcing Inc. Her company has already put in next spring's orders. ""We are buying as much as we can,"" Ms. Kegebein said. Should higher tariffs kick in, she said, the company may switch to buying goods already sitting in American warehouses.

The operation, which is currently in the planning stage, would include at least two ships on a multiday mission, the officials. said.
The U.S. maneuver, should it happen, comes at a time of renewed tensions between Washington and Beijing, with Taiwan, an independently governed democracy claimed by China, a hot-button issue. The sail-through would also come just after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with regional defense chiefs in Singapore and stressed that the U.S. would sail anywhere it wanted in international waters.
""The U.S. will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, and we encourage all nations to confidently exercise their right to do the same,"" Mr. Mattis said at the Asean meeting. The Chinese Foreign and Defense ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
While in Singapore, Mr. Mattis met with his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Wei Fenghe, in what he called an effort at resetting an increasingly strained military relationship between the two countries.
U.S. Pacific Command declined to comment about its coming missions.
In July, two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the strait between China and Taiwan, which operates as a sovereign state but which Beijing sees as a renegade province. China in January said it sailed an aircraft carrier battle group through the strait as tensions with Taiwan ramped up.
While the U.S. acknowledges that Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China, an American Navy transit of the strait would be seen in Taiwan as a demonstration of support for the island.
Earlier this month, Vice President Mike Pence delivered a speech in which he praised Taiwan's ""embrace of democracy"" but said the U.S. would continue to adhere to the one-China policy that acknowledges that Beijing claims the island as its territory.

China's Private-Sector Rescue Looks Like Anything But; Xi Jinping has vowed to take care of China's troubled private-sector companies. That actually seems to mean more state control.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2124421914?accountid=14586,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged ""unwavering"" support for the country's struggling private companies. That may not come in the form entrepreneurs desire.
Along with recent efforts from top policy makers to talk up local stock markets , Mr. Xi's comments--published over the weekend in state media--indicate high anxiety in Beijing. But that concern likely isn't much about stock prices themselves, given share ownership still makes up only a small percentage of household wealth in China.
Instead--as in 2015, when Chinese stocks cratered--the worry is more to do with the high level of leverage in the market , and what that could mean for China's financial system. The difference this time is the prevalence of major shareholders in listed companies that have pledged their stakes in return for loans. Three years ago, the problem was retail investors bingeing on margin loans to buy stocks. Some 4.3 trillion yuan ($620 billion) worth of Chinese stocks is now being used as collateral for borrowing, according to Wind--equal to about 9% of the whole market.
Most of these loans have been taken out by shareholders of small and private companies, instead of big state-owned enterprises. Goldman Sachs estimates total share-pledged loans outstanding could amount to $290 billion--about half of which could now be at risk of margin calls, given that Chinese stocks have dropped almost 30% since January .
Beijing could use brute-force policies to stem any further selloff triggered by margin calls, for example by banning brokers from selling loan collateral into the market. But borrowers are still going to find it hard to repay or roll over their loans, especially as private companies have fared particularly badly amid the Chinese economy's slowdown.
One other solution so far has been for state-owned companies to step in. They have already spent $6.2 billion this year on buying up big stakes in 39 private companies, according to Goldman, with slightly less than half of those deals happening just in the past two months.
These stake buys might help avoid defaults on these share-pledged loans, in turn benefiting the banks and brokerages that have lent to them. The flow-on effect is less control over companies for private owners, a trend that is also consistent with the growing influence of the state-owned sector in China under Mr. Xi. The Chinese leader's ""support"" for the private sector might just mean another leg up for state control .

Chinese Auto Maker Secures $146 Billion--With a B--in Credit; Funding appears designed to show China's determination to stimulate a slowing economy,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2124723600?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI--A Chinese auto maker that once made limousines for Mao Zedong says it has secured credit lines worth $146 billion--yes, billion--to fund ""future undertakings,"" an enormous war chest for a company that only sold about 78,000 cars under its own brands in the first half of the year.
State-owned auto maker FAW Group Co., which mainly builds vehicles in partnership with Toyota Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, said on its website that the financing was arranged with 16 of China's major banks, including Bank of China Ltd., Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.
FAW said the agreement would provide ""financial security"" and ""long-term cooperation for both the banks and the company.""
It didn't immediately respond to a request for more information on how the funds might be spent, but the effort appears designed to show China's determination to stimulate a slowing economy amid a trade battle with the U.S., with FAW essentially being used as a public investment vehicle.
The funding was announced during a four-day conference in FAW's base, the northeastern Rust Belt city of Changchun. Guangfa Bank, which is extending credit of $4.32 billion, said its financial support will contribute to the revitalization of northeast China.
China's rate of economic growth slipped to 6.5% in the third quarter , the country reported last week, the slowest pace since the global financial crisis.
Even so, the size of the credit facility baffled analysts. The $146 billion number ""is mind-bogglingly large,"" said Robin Zhu, senior analyst at Bernstein Research. ""I struggle to rationalize why they'd need so much money."" From the banks' perspective, it's hard to see FAW generating a return on the capital, Mr. Zhu said.
While FAW itself isn't listed, the share price of its unit FAW Car Co., an umbrella for the company's own auto brands, has fallen by roughly half in Shenzhen this year, with the subsidiary advising the market in July that its profits would decline by as much as 78% in 2018.
On its website, FAW reported revenue of $67.6 billion in 2017--roughly half that of General Motors Co.--without mentioning profits.
Like most of China's large state-run auto makers, FAW is heavily reliant on its joint ventures with foreign manufacturers, despite protracted efforts to develop its own car brands. FAW sold more than 1.7 million vehicles in the first half of 2018, but only about 4% of them were FAW-badged cars.
That dependency leaves auto makers such as FAW vulnerable at a time when Beijing is allowing foreign car companies freedom to gain control of joint ventures, or even become sole operators, for the first time. Earlier this month, BMW AG took control of its joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd., another state-owned car maker with little standing as an independent auto brand.
Auto makers must also make costly investments in research and development to keep pace in an industry that is shifting away from gasoline-powered cars toward electric, autonomous vehicles with high-speed internet connections.
Even so, the size of the credit facility baffled analysts. The $146 billion number ""is mind-bogglingly large,"" said Robin Zhu, senior analyst at Bernstein Research. ""I struggle to rationalize why they'd need so much money."" From the banks' perspective, it's hard to see FAW generating a return on the capital, Mr. Zhu said.
Last year FAW signed a deal with two other big state-run auto makers, Chang'an Automobile Co. and Dongfeng Motor Corp., to cooperate on technology development--a move auto analysts said prefigured a possible merger of three relatively weak and inefficient players. China is still home to more than 100 auto makers and consolidation is long overdue, analysts say.
FAW has also outlined some big ambitions--which may now be affordable--since coming under the leadership of a new chairman, Xu Liuping, last year.
In May it invested $260 million in electric-car startup Byton, while Mr. Xu has said he aims to revamp Hongqi, FAW's luxury marque, famous in China as a maker of limousines for Mao Zedong and other top Communist Party officials.

China's Neighbors Could Win From U.S. Tariff Tussle; Some Asian economies could benefit from a redeployment of investment from companies now operating in China,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2129787576?accountid=14586,"Trade tensions between the U.S. and China could benefit other Asian economies and markets, according to analysts with an alternative take on the impact of rising tariffs across the Pacific.
What's Happening
The interconnectedness of supply chains across Asia helps explain market weakness across the region this year--if Chinese exports suffer, so will many suppliers whose components go into these products.
But given tariffs raise the price of some Chinese goods for U.S. importers, some researchers suggest countries exporting similar products could end up as beneficiaries, as American buyers look for alternative suppliers. Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists say Taiwan, Vietnam and South Korea have the most to gain, given similar export profiles to China.
Some Asian economies could benefit from a redeployment of investment from companies now operating in China, too. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, released last week, suggests around 70% of companies are considering relocating some or all of their manufacturing out of China. Southeast Asia is overwhelmingly the preferred destination.
To be sure, markets in Southeast Asia have other problems--like rising U.S. interest rates, and the potential impact of a slowdown in Chinese economic growth.
What It Means
The impact would vary by sectors and countries. For example, technology companies in Vietnam and Malaysia could win out, while Thailand's position as a producer of auto parts could benefit that sector, the Economist Intelligence Unit says.
BNP Paribas senior economists Steven Friedman and Chi Low say low-end imports such as shoes, toys and textiles could be sourced instead from Vietnam, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia, while electronic equipment and machinery could be purchased from Mexico, Turkey or South Korea.
Meanwhile, at the end of the year the successor to the trade deal previously known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes into force, albeit without U.S. participation. Economists at HSBC say the potential GDP gains from the deal's tariff cuts outweigh the losses from even the full deployment of suggested U.S.-China tariffs.
""The region's traditional reliance on markets in the West obviated the need for a bigger liberalization push locally: intricate supply chains notwithstanding, economies tended to view each other more as competitors than collaborators,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC. ""Well, that's changing. The more restrictions are imposed elsewhere, the more the region will need to open internally if it wants to preserve trade as an engine of growth,"" he added.
So far, depressed regional equity markets don't appear to be pricing in a windfall from this reordering of trade relationships. But that might be in part because identifying clear corporate winners of scale isn't straightforward. The EIU, for example, cites international groups such as Sony Corp. and Panasonic Corp. in Malaysia and Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. in Vietnam, as among those with existing footprints allowing them to redeploy resources smoothly, rather than local companies.

Technology (A Special Report) --- U.S. and China Battle to Win AI: Kai-Fu Lee says China could catch up within five years,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2132193440?accountid=14586,"The U.S. may be winning the race in artificial intelligence for now. But it won't last for long.
So predicts Kai-Fu Lee, chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a Beijing-based venture-capital firm. He believes the U.S.'s current technological edge over China could disappear within five years, thanks to government support, a growing force of entrepreneurs and their speed of execution. Mr. Lee recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal about the AI race, entrepreneurship in China, and prospects for leading U.S. tech companies in the world's most populous country. Edited excerpts follow.
WSJ: How do Chinese and U.S. strategies to develop AI differ?
MR. LEE: China's techno-utilitarian policy encourages technology to be launched first, observed, and allowed to proceed without obstruction if things go smoothly. If there are issues, it could quickly come up with regulations. An example is mobile payments. In the U.S., this might raise all kinds of lobby, security, hacking concerns from the credit-card companies and banks. But in China, Tencent and Alibaba were permitted to try to run payment systems as software companies, and they did a great job. Mobile payment took over in China.
In China, a highway is being built with sensors to improve autonomous driving, new cities are being developed with autonomous vehicles, some with two layers of roads -- one layer for pedestrians, pets, bicycles, and another layer for cars. All of these will help with testing for autonomous-vehicle systems to be launched sooner. With AI applications, you need a lot of data to do testing. China has a lot of data, so its approach allows it to move faster.
WSJ: What do you think the U.S. needs to improve on and where does China need to invest further when it comes to AI?
MR. LEE: It's going to be about who has more data, faster entrepreneurs, lots of AI engineers and government support. China will continue to catch up against the U.S. in terms of building products and monetizing. What could work in the U.S.'s favor is if someone disrupts the whole thing with a brand new fundamental technological change.
WSJ: Which country is ahead?
MR. LEE: In internet AI, which is algorithms making profitable recommendations for people based on their Web browsing history, China and the U.S. are about equal. China will probably get ahead because it has more user data. In business AI, where companies mine their customer data to come up with new product ideas and improve service, or use it to monitor systems to make them more efficient or lucrative, the U.S. is ahead, and will probably stay ahead because its enterprise data is properly archived and more usable for AI. In perception AI, or things like facial recognition and other biometric interfaces, China is ahead because it is building more sensors cheaply and for broader uses, and it will probably get further ahead.
In autonomous vehicles, it's incredibly hard to tell because it depends on policy. The question is, is the road ahead to making autonomous vehicles ubiquitous mostly about technology breakthroughs? Then the U.S. is ahead. If it's a matter of rapidly testing and evolving without policy, lobbying and unions holding it back, it would be China in the lead.
WSJ: Do you think Chinese tech companies will be more successful because entrepreneurs there do the grunt work?
MR. LEE: The Chinese companies are not nearly as breakthrough-innovative as the many Silicon Valley greats. Whether it's Elon Musk or Steve Jobs. The whole Chinese education system doesn't really easily train these types of brilliant thinkers. But on the other hand, I think if Silicon Valley or the U.S. continues to view China as copycats, then it will miss many opportunities.
WSJ: What are the prospects for U.S. tech companies in China amid the trade war?
MR. LEE: The U.S. and China are almost parallel universes. American companies will not succeed in China, with or without significant regulation. Same for Chinese companies in the U.S. We're almost at a point, at least in consumer internet and AI companies, where U.S. companies don't fit the ecosystem.
WSJ: So you don't think the Chinese government is making it more difficult for foreign companies to operate there? Or is it more an issue that U.S companies built products that don't work for consumers in China?
MR. LEE: I actually think Google and Facebook will get some element of their products in China. But I don't think they will be successful, just because of the parallel-universe reason.

U.S. Panel Warns China Tech Prowess Threatens U.S. Security; Report finds China's dominance of networking-equipment manufacturing threatens 5G wireless infrastructure,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2132537806?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON--A commission of security and economic experts convened by Congress warned that China's technology-manufacturing strength threatens U.S. national security and advised U.S. government agencies to be mindful of Chinese attempts to compromise government systems.
In a new report , the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission found Chinese dominance of networking-equipment manufacturing threatens the security of U.S. fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless infrastructure. The panel cited Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. in particular.
In addition, China's position as the world's largest manufacturer of internet-connected household devices creates ""numerous points of vulnerability for intelligence collection, cyberattacks, industrial control, or censorship,"" said the panel, which includes appointees by Senate and House leaders of both parties.
Beijing has denied interfering in U.S. affairs and says much of U.S. policy toward China is an inappropriate attempt to contain its rise.
While many policy makers historically considered the commission's recommendations to be aggressive, they are increasingly being viewed as mainstream as U.S. officials' attitudes toward Beijing harden.
Among the commission's other recommendations:
Â· Congress should require the White House Office of Management and Budget to ensure all government agencies address supply-chain vulnerabilities stemming from China, including potential cyber, operations, physical, information and data-security issues.
Â· Congress should direct the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and Federal Communications Commission to ensure 5G technology is rapidly and securely deployed in the U.S. ""with a particular focus on the threat posed by equipment and services designed or manufactured in China.""
Â· Congress should direct the Commerce Department to reassess whether U.S. export control policy for dual-use technology should continue to consider Hong Kong--where controls are more relaxed--and mainland China as separate customs areas, given Beijing's continued erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. The report cites Beijing's aggressive crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong as well as its ""direct involvement"" in the Hong Kong government's rejection of a U.S. fugitive-surrender request, among other issues.
Â· Congress should have the U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security study the implications of China's Central Military Commission's 2018 assumption of direct control over the China Coast Guard. The departments should analyze China's use of the coast guard as a ""coercive tool"" in disputed waters, and determine how the change could affect interactions with the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard.
Â· Congress should ask the Justice Department to look into utilizing the little-known U.S. ""Conspiracy Against Rights"" law to prosecute Chinese Communist Party affiliates who ""threaten, coerce, or otherwise intimidate U.S. residents.""
The report also contains a section of recommendations on countering potential security and economic issues posed by Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, a global development plan that seeks to expand Chinese influence across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.

"Behind China's Startup Surge: Meritocracy and 'Growth Hacks'; 'No monopoly is safe' in China, says Ben Harburg, managing partner at MSA Capital","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2132924050?accountid=14586,"LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.--A tidal wave of cash has helped turn China's internet startups into formidable superpowers rivaling their U.S. counterparts. But venture capitalists argue that a unique set of forces are also spurring the startups' ascendancy.
Behind China's rise is a mobile-first mind-set among entrepreneurs who preach meritocracy, have easy access to centralized personal data and are adept at so-called growth hacks to aggregate supply and demand quickly, said venture capitalists at The Wall Street Journal's WSJ Tech D. Live conference on Wednesday.
China's tech giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are being followed by fast-growing startups like Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., owner of China's top news-aggregator app, and online services company Meituan Dianping. They are not bound by legacy ways of doing business in the U.S., the venture investors said.
It starts with China's tech culture, which has a meritocratic system that rewards success and speeds the growth of startups, said Connie Chan, an Andreessen Horowitz general partner who focuses on China. She said she often recommends young tech workers to go to China if they're looking for a fast promotion track. Clear milestones mean techies can get promoted--or fired--very quickly, she said.
""I find it a lot more egalitarian than the U.S. both within the venture community as well as within startups,"" said Ben Harburg, managing partner at Chinese venture firm MSA Capital. Mr. Harburg said many of the companies his firm has invested in have female founders, both in consumer companies and hard sciences. ""You see a lot less of that fratty, bro-ey culture,"" he said. ""To me it feels a lot more meritocratic, less about connections.""
Ms. Chan said Chinese internet entrepreneurs tend to build companies faster than in the U.S. because they focus solely on building a mobile app--versus also on a desktop site--simplifying their ability to jump into multiple local services, from ride-hailing and food delivery to movie tickets.
They also think of more creative ways to quickly aggregate supply, she said. In the U.S., if a startup offering restaurant reviews wanted to add reservations to its app, it might build a sales team, go to each restaurant and try to secure deals.
In China, Ms. Chan said, a company might let people submit reservation requests that trigger an automated phone call to the restaurants, which can accept or reject the reservation by pressing ""1"" or ""2"" on the phone. Over time, by aggregating enough diners, the restaurants themselves demand a more direct relationship. In food delivery, companies in Southeast Asia didn't sign deals with restaurants or food stands, she said. Instead they jump-started the business by having delivery people stand in line, which in turn caused the businesses to forge partnerships.
""No monopoly is safe"" in China, said Mr. Harburg, enabling a fluid and dynamic market in which there isn't as much consumer loyalty, thereby breeding competition and propelling startups.
Mr. Harburg said it is also easier to get personal data in the health sector, an inefficient industry in the U.S., thanks in part to strong privacy protections. He said a startup that he has invested in was able to sign deals with dozens of hospitals for quick access to 300 million patient records.
""A lot of data is much more centralized in China,"" he said, so a huge supply of data may be accessible when starting a business.

"Foreign Investors Invade China's Cozy Treasury Market; By percentage, international share of Beijing bonds now about matches China's share of U.S. government debt","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2135088981?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI--Foreign investment in Chinese government bonds is surging , creating risks for both investors and Beijing, which has long kept a tight hold on this $2 trillion market.
Borrowing costs in the world's second-largest economy are determined in part by China's equivalent of the Treasury market. This is dominated by local banks, insurers and brokerages, most state-owned. In the past the central bank has injected short-term funds to prop up the wider market, or quietly told banks to buy or sell--so-called window guidance.
Now Beijing, facing capital outflows and a shrinking trade surplus, is opening the door wider to foreign institutions such as central banks and university endowment funds. Since 2016, the yuan has been part of the
International Monetary Fund's elite club of reserve currencies , while Beijing has expanded market access, first for investors with trading accounts in mainland China and later in Hong Kong. Its government debt is poised to join major world bond indexes .
Global investors held a record 1.08 trillion yuan ($155.63 billion), or 8.1%, of China's domestic government bonds in October, up from 2.7% in February 2016, when access was first widened. That is similar to Beijing's 7.6% share of U.S. Treasurys as of August.
The new arrivals face some unfamiliar risks. China's leaders are inclined to tamp down instability, and have balked at giving market forces free rein in the equity markets. Global investors, used to evaluating debt based on the likes of supply and demand, creditworthiness and economic fundamentals, might find it harder to predict how Chinese bonds will react to developments such as faster inflation or rising global borrowing costs.
From Beijing's perspective, the influx should initially help keep interest rates low, stimulating the slowing economy. But over time the presence of investors with plenty of alternative places to put their cash--in contrast to captive domestic institutions--could push yields up. A rush for the exits could create a situation much like a typical emerging-markets crisis.
""A sudden retreat of foreign investors would be a medium-term concern for Beijing because lots of these inflows are pro-cyclical, meaning when the economy is in a downturn, foreign investors tend to pull out of a country,"" said Logan Wright, a Hong Kong-based analyst at research firm Rhodium Group.
These foreign institutions have largely focused on central-government debt--safer than that issued by local governments or Chinese companies, and tax-free. Though Chinese banks still own roughly two-thirds of this market, foreigners have accounted for 44% of net buying this year.
""What really matters is these marginal purchases,"" said Mr. Wright. On current trends, his firm estimates foreign ownership could come close to 25% in four or five years, not far off levels in other Asian emerging markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia.
The newcomers have already made their presence felt. As they snapped up safer, shorter-dated debt this year, prices rose. Yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, fell more sharply than those on longer-term bonds--a ""yield-curve steepening."" The yield gap between 10-year and three-year bonds has widened this year to 0.43 percentage point from 0.10 percentage point.
The steepening ""shows foreign investors are already a formidable force in this market,"" said Peter Ru, chief investment officer of China fixed income at Neuberger Berman. Other investors and traders also cited foreign buying.
In another episode, the Russian central bank caused a stir in late April when it unexpectedly bought a large chunk of a single, five-year government bond, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The bond's yield fell sharply even as yields on similar bonds were rising.
""It might have been just a normal asset allocation by that central bank, but it definitely sent ripples across the market,"" said Meng Huan, a bond-fund manager at Shanghai Yunhan Asset Management Co.
A few weeks later, China's Ministry of Finance, using a new intervention mechanism, sold three billion yuan of the same bond, pushing prices down and yields up. The anomaly disappeared. Neither institution responded to requests for comment.
Such reluctance by Beijing to cede control is a potential turnoff for global money managers, as are an increasingly tough economic climate and a lack of policy stability.
""It's been a tough year to trade in this market because policies have swung back and forth between cutting the country's debt pile and supporting economic growth,"" said Mr. Ru at Neuberger Berman.
Local traders and investors say they welcome foreign investors because they will bring more sophistication and diverse investment styles into a once uniform market. More activity could also mean higher profits for trading desks.
""They also possess a more global perspective and that's why we are paying a lot more attention to what they do in the market nowadays,"" said Ms. Meng.

"U.S. Trade Representative Criticizes 'Unfair' Practices by China; Report says China continues to use cybertheft, espionage and government pressure to illicitly obtain U.S. technology","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2135778462?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTON--Less than two weeks ahead of a China-U.S. summit, the U.S. Trade Representative accused Beijing of failing to change economic policies that threaten U.S. industry.
""China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable and market-distorting practices,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a news release.
The trade representative's office Tuesday released a 50-page report on Chinese trade practices, an update on a March study that alleged Beijing used various techniques to coerce U.S. firms to hand over leading-edge technology. The Trump administration has used the March report as the basis for levying tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, about half of what Beijing sends to the U.S. annually.
In the new report, the trade representative's office says China continues to use unfair practices to illicitly obtain U.S. technology, including cybertheft, espionage and government pressure.
President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in Buenos Aires, around Dec. 1, at a session of the Group of 20 nations. For the past few weeks, U.S. and Chinese negotiators have been talking by telephone and videoconference about ways to ease trade tensions and head off additional U.S. tariffs. China has sent a proposal of areas for future negotiations.
While Mr. Trump has indicated some optimism about the talks, his administration is sharply divided.
The trade representative's office and others in the administration, including many in national security agencies, have found the proposal inadequate, say people briefed on the discussions. Others, including at the Treasury Department and White House's National Economic Council, are examining whether the offer could serve as the basis for a limited deal.
Some business groups worry that Mr. Trump, seeking a political victory and a boost to the markets, might settle too easily, especially if China were to pledge to increase purchases and ease some regulations on U.S. companies in China. Those groups want deeper, structural changes that are tough for Beijing to make and back Mr. Lighthizer's stance, even though they disagree with the tactic of relying on tariffs .
The trade representative's office released the report as ""part of its ongoing monitoring and enforcement efforts on China,"" said an official with the office. The representative is ""willing to engage in efforts that could lead to a resolution"" of the trade fight and hopes ""to make progress in the upcoming meeting at the G-20 summit,"" the official said.
The new report highlights deep suspicion of Beijing. It notes that China had removed requirements that foreign electric-vehicle makers form joint ventures with Chinese firms and had pledged to remove equity caps on makers of traditional vehicles in the next few years.
However, the report says, China is planning new requirements on auto investments ""that would be more onerous on non-Chinese entities."" Foreign auto makers trying to establish new factories without a Chinese JV partner ""would find it particularly difficult to meet these new requirements.""
Other Chinese policies, the report says, could ""exacerbate pressure on foreign auto makers to remain in JVs with their Chinese competitors."" Those policies include a complicated new fuel-efficiency requirements.

"Natural High: Gas Sellers Spared From China's Market Slump; Gainers in this downbeat year include China Gas Holdings, China Resources Gas, ENN Energy and Kunlun Energy","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2136396108?accountid=14586,"China's big gas distributors are among the few stock-market winners this year, despite higher fuel prices' cutting into profit margins.
What's Happening
Trade tensions and economic weakness have driven most mainland Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong lower this year. Less than a third of stocks in the Hang Seng's mainland-focused HSM 100 index are in positive territory for 2018.
Among the gainers, however, are gas distributors such as China Gas Holdings, with a market cap of $16 billion, and smaller rivals China Resources Gas Group, ENN Energy Holdings and Kunlun Energy Co.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has tried to curb pollution, partly by reining in coal use. That has increased gas consumption, which was up 19% from a year earlier in the first nine months of 2018.
The sudden expansion of the market has brought teething problems. A shortage late last year briefly tripled prices of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, causing some factories to close and pressuring the margins of local providers, which struggled to pass all of the increased cost to customers.
There could be some supply tightness again this winter, but Fitch Ratings sees the sector as better prepared overall. China increased both its import and storage capacity, and distributors have stocked up.
What it Means
Analysts at Nomura Securities say ""gas-supply tightness will become the new normal"" for China as demand growth keeps outstripping increases in domestic supply, requiring LNG imports to cover the gap. They foresee roughly 20% compound annual growth in earnings for China Gas and CR Gas over the next three years.
Their peers at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about China Gas, noting it has grown rapidly as coal-fired power stations switch to natural gas.
China's growing appetite is good for global LNG prices. The country's sharply increased imports over the past few years have made it the world's second-largest customer behind Japan.
At the same time, though, suppliers such as the U.S. and Australia have boosted production and export capabilities--which helps explain why prices remain well below the highs of earlier this decade.

Why China's Deleveraging Has Faltered; China's campaign to curb financial risks had notable successes in 2016 and 2017 but the ugly side effects are now coming home to roost,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2136867956?accountid=14586,"Beijing hasn't yet unleashed another large debt-fueled stimulus for China's stuttering economy. But beneath the radar, its progress on tackling financial vulnerabilities has started to unwind.
Chinese regulators went to bat against two big financial risks in 2016. The first was small banks' mushrooming dependence on wholesale borrowing both to fund themselves and juice the returns offered by their wealth-management products. In late 2016, regulators cracked down hard --interbank repo borrowing fell by a third and banks' wealth-management business shriveled through 2017.
Regulators also went after corporate debt, much of it owed by state-owned enterprises, which had hit 166% of GDP in early 2016. Beijing's approach: push SOEs' margins higher with policies that goosed cement and steel prices , while also shutting down swaths of privately owned factory capacity. Remaining SOE competitors could then charge higher prices, helping them pay off borrowings . By late 2017, Chinese corporate debt had leveled off to 160% of GDP, according to the Bank for International Settlements, the first year-over-year fall since 2011.
In both cases, however, progress has proven ephemeral. Interbank repo borrowing shot back to its highest since 2015 in the third quarter. And corporate leverage has started climbing again, reaching 164% of GDP in early 2018.
What happened? Regulators have attacked the banking system's symptoms without addressing the root of its ills: implicit state guarantees and interest rate controls.
SOEs remain laden with debt because lenders still see them as essentially risk-free customers. And big banks' artificially cheap retail deposits provide little incentive to seek out higher return lending opportunities. Small banks, meanwhile, still can't freely raise deposit rates to compete for capital, meaning they must borrow from their larger cousins or invent high-yield investment products to attract funds. The so-called ""regulatory windstorm"" of the past two years has done nothing to change this fundamental picture.
What it has done, however, is make life very difficult for private sector borrowers, who relied on funding from banks' wealth-management industry and other shadow banking channels . Many private companies have been forced to borrow at exorbitant rates to stay afloat or finance new investments. This deterioration in private sector finances has coincided with the rebound in the overall corporate debt to GDP ratio, suggesting problems have simply migrated from the state sector into private companies.
China's central bank has tried to ease the situation by pushing down interbank interest rates. Small banks, though, now face regulatory limits on how much they can rely on wholesale funding. The extra cash released by the central bank is instead flowing to brokerages and other asset managers instead, who are taking advantage of cheaper money. The risk is this will simply juice another bubble in the Chinese bond market, just like the one the central bank pricked in early 2017.
Chinese policy makers in 2013 pledged to allow a more ""decisive"" role for market forces in the economy. They didn't. The costs of that decision are now becoming apparent.

"Commodity Woes Run Deeper Than China; The commodity selloff should worry investors, but not because of China per se","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2138538721?accountid=14586,"China is the world's heavyweight consumer of most industrial commodities. So when things go wrong in commodity markets, it's always tempting to point the finger at it. This time, that might be a mistake.
Iron-ore prices plunged nearly 10% on Monday, following a sharp fall in steel prices earlier in November. The weakness in both comes after a tough summer and autumn for other major commodities such as aluminum and copper, which are down 8% and 12%, respectively, since June. Is this a sign China is collapsing after all?
There's little doubt that weaker seasonal demand from China is weighing on prices. But on a year-over-year basis, the fundamental drivers of Chinese commodity demand still look strong. Housing prices in medium-size cities, which drive the nation's iron-ore and copper demand, are zooming along , rising nearly 10% in October, the fastest pace since at least 2010. Industrial growth accelerated in October, too. And steel inventories look comparable to their level this time last year: lower for rebar, slightly higher for hot- and cold-rolled coil. There's still no sign of major problems in China's critical construction sector, in part because until very recently, it was still receiving a major boost from housing subsidies .
Unfortunately, the same thing can't be said for the rest of the world. China's manufacturing purchasing managers index has edged down 1.1 points since January; over the same period, Germany's is down by 8 points, the U.K.'s by 4, Japan's by 1.9 and the U.S. by 1.4. Weakness in copper and aluminum, first evident in January and February, lines up far better with the widespread decline in global PMIs this year than with China specifically.
Meanwhile, this week's selloff aside, the metal most closely linked with China--iron ore--has mostly trended sideways. Iron ore started the year at $68 dollars a metric ton; after Monday's drop it stood at $65. Copper has lost 15% of its value so far in 2018. So has aluminum.
The broad commodity selloff this year should certainly worry investors, but not because of China per se. China's growth will deteriorate further in early 2019. Global growth, however, is clearly slowing nearly everywhere outside the U.S.--that is what really ails commodities. And with the U.S. PMI and financial markets now also showing signs of strain, the outlook is set to worsen further.
Most investors will be glumly nursing their eggnog this year. By next Christmas, the weather outside could be even more frightful.

"Trump: China to 'Reduce and Remove' Tariffs on American Cars; 'China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%,' president says","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2140769851?accountid=14586,"SHANGHAI--China has agreed to cut tariffs on American-made cars, President Trump said on Twitter, apparently signaling Beijing's readiness to make concessions to prevent further escalating trade tensions.
Chinese officials didn't immediately confirm or deny Mr. Trump's assertion, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman on Monday sidestepping questions on auto tariffs.
""The two presidents instructed their economic teams to work toward the direction for removing all tariffs for win-win outcomes and mutual benefit,"" Geng Shuang said, describing the outcome of weekend talks between Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 Summit in Buenos Aires.
The concession would be a notable one on Beijing's part: U.S. automobile exports to China were worth $9.5 billion last year, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, topped only by aerospace and agriculture exports.
Three quarters of those exports came from four U.S. states: Alabama, California, Kentucky and South Carolina. Among the biggest beneficiaries if the tariffs are lifted, in addition to Ford Motor Co. and Tesla Inc. : German auto makers BMW AG and Daimler AG, which build sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. for export to China.
Still, the trade spat may ultimately persuade some manufacturers to insulate themselves against future tariff shocks by building fewer export models in the U.S.
""Long-term, in response to these disputes their strategy will be to export less and to build more locally,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based research consultancy Automotive Foresight.
BMW declined to comment. Daimler, Ford and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Trump announced the Chinese commitment to reduce tariffs in a tweet sent out late Sunday Washington, D.C. time, early Monday in Argentina. ""China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%,"" he said.
After Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi dined together Saturday night, the U.S. postponed by 90 days its threatened tariff increase --to 25% from 10% on $200 billion in Chinese goods--setting the stage for intense trade talks over the coming weeks. U.S. officials said that both countries recognized the increase would have hurt their economies.
Under international pressure to open its automotive sector, China cut its tariff on vehicles to 15% from 25% in July--but within days increased its tariff on U.S.-made cars to 40% in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs on vehicle imports.
That put companies exporting cars to China from the U.S.--notably BMW, Daimler's Mercedes unit, Ford and its Lincoln division, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV-owned Jeep, Tesla and Volvo Car Group--at a significant cost disadvantage to those shipping from Europe and Japan.
For Mr. Xi, the U.S. auto tariffs are a relatively painless issue on which to retreat without demanding reciprocal action from Washington: China exports very few vehicles to the U.S, and imports are a tiny fraction of China's domestic car market--4% of vehicles sold last year, or 1.2 million cars, according to the China Automobile Dealers Association. They were chiefly luxury cars destined for affluent buyers.
Most global auto makers build the bulk of the vehicles they sell in China at local plants through joint ventures. Some, such as General Motors Co., export to China only in very low volumes, though for others exports are a lucrative niche.
Ford was having a bleak year in China even before the tariffs hit, and through October its sales were down 31% from a year earlier, including a 15% drop in sales of imports. High-value imports had been a bright spot, but they too slowed as tariffs bit.
Sales of its Lincoln vehicles through October were up 3%--to nearly 46,000 vehicles, second only to BMW among U.S.-made imports--but Ford has been absorbing the cost of tariffs to keep retail prices competitive.
Similarly, Tesla last month--after its August-October sales in China slid 56% from a year earlier--said it would slash retail prices in China, canceling increases it had introduced to pass the cost of tariffs onto consumers.
Both Tesla and Ford are moving away from the export model.
Ford was already gearing up to start building Lincoln vehicles in China in 2019 before the trade dispute began; it plans to launch three localized models by 2021. Tesla said it would speed up plans to open a plant in Shanghai.
GM's announcement last month that it would close several U.S. plant drew fire from Mr. Trump , who declared the company should build more in the U.S. and less in China. But auto analysts said exporting cars from the U.S. to China no longer makes sense for most manufacturers.
Assembling autos in relatively costly U.S. plants and then shipping them across the Pacific is not ""economically viable in a hypercompetitive (and slowing) China market,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Shanghai consultancy Automobility.
Volvo, which had planned to base global production of its S60 sedan at its new plant in Charleston, SC, said last month it would instead split production between the U.S. and China in response to tariffs.
In interview earlier this year, Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo, which is owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., said tariffs were bad news for Volvo's American workers, whose jobs are partly supported by the export market.
BMW has made similar appeals against tariffs. A spokeswoman said that it exports 70% of the sports utility vehicles built at its plant in Spartanburg, S.C., and that over a third of those exports go to China. Earlier this year, BMW said it would build more models in China and acquired a majority stake in its local joint venture Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd.

The statement, attributed to an unnamed spokesman, said that the negotiations have a ""clear timeline and road map"" and that China aims to quickly implement ""an agreed upon consensus.""

Right after the presidents' dinnertime parlay, Chinese officials said the two sides agreed to put tariffs in abeyance to negotiate a settlement but offered few other details then and in the days since.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that he believed Mr. Xi ""meant every word"" in their meeting at the G-20 summit.
""Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina,"" he said.
In the meantime, earlier tweets from Mr. Trump, as well as statements from him and top administration officials, have described concessions Beijing purportedly made--including a reduction in tariffs on American-made autos and an agreement to purchase a ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products from the U.S.
The Commerce Ministry's statement didn't mention purchases of agricultural and other products, tariff reductions for imports of U.S. autos or negotiating about intellectual property protection, technology transfers and other structural issues the U.S. says are on the agenda.
Chinese officials have suggested that China will step up purchases of U.S. farm and energy products such as soybeans and natural gas as part of Saturday's deal. Demand for those products is immense. Still, it's unclear how large China's purchases will be and whether Beijing will remove the punitive tariffs or offer rebates to the buyers.
Many Chinese economists and academics view Mr. Trump's trade strategy as stirring up confusion in order to draw out concessions from Beijing.

""China should prepare but not rush to make concessions,"" said Yu Yongding, a researcher with government think tank Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and former adviser to China's central bank. ""This is a competition of endurance to see who breaks first.""
Should talks fail to yield an agreement, the Trump administration has said it would move ahead with raising tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25%, from 10% currently. The increase was originally set for Jan. 1, and in the lead-up to the Trump-Xi summit, Chinese officials said getting a stay on the increase was paramount since they didn't want to negotiate under threat.
President Xi is under pressure to strike a deal. Economic growth is flagging; on Wednesday, the cabinet agreed to increase unemployment insurance tax rebates to companies that don't lay off workers. Mr. Xi is also facing criticism from within the Communist Party for stoking tensions with the U.S., adding drag to the slowing economy and alienating China's neighbors.
Beijing still has yet to confirm many of the items the Trump administration has said were decided on Saturday.
The Commerce Ministry's statement also didn't specify a start date for negotiations nor say when the 90-day clock would start ticking; U.S. officials, after some confusion, say it started on Saturday, meaning the deadline would fall around March 1. Mr. Trump has tweeted that the deadline could be extended.
China's acknowledgment of the 90-day time cap signals acceptance of one U.S. term to the trade truce. Likewise, the punishment for intellectual property theft is progress on a problem Beijing has promised to resolve but taken few steps to do so.
In a recent joint statement, three dozen Chinese government agencies and official bodies laid out 38 punishments for companies that violate intellectual property rights. The punishments go into effect this month and include restricting the violators' access to financing, including state subsidies.
The statement was dated Nov. 21 but only made public Tuesday. The National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planning agency and the lead body in the initiative, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the time lag.

Solving China's Drugs-Price Problem Is Hurting Drugmakers; A pilot program aimed at lowering generic drugs prices has hammered pharma-sector stocks in China,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2151048756?accountid=14586,"China's cure for its health-care problems is causing plenty of pain for drugmakers.
Just as in the U.S., expensive prescription drugs have long been a headache in China. Government insurance usually doesn't cover the full price of drugs for patients, so many have to pay a hefty portion out of their own pockets, especially those with serious diseases.
In its latest bid to lower medicine costs, the Chinese government recently asked drugmakers to bid for the right to supply hospitals in 11 major cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. The winners will be those willing to accept the lowest prices. Hospitals are the biggest buyers of drugs in China, accounting for 68% of the $200 billion market, according to health-data company Iqvia.
Judging by the tender results announced Thursday, the plan seems to have worked--at least from the government's point of view. Bid winners cut their drugs prices by 46% on average, with some taking cuts of more than 90%, according to Credit Suisse. The tender comprised 31 off-patent drugs, including Atorvastatin, the generic version of Pfizer's cholesterol medication Lipitor.
For the companies involved, that was something of a Pyrrhic victory: Shares in Chinese pharma stocks were hammered after the results were announced. Hong Kong-listed Sino Biopharmaceutical has shed around a quarter of its value since Thursday, while CSPC Pharmaceutical has dropped nearly 20%.
Investors' clear worry is that the government's pilot program could be extended across China. That would translate into sharply lower drug prices and, therefore, margins for Chinese pharmaceutical companies, most of whom rely on generic drugs. If Beijing does expand the program, it could spur consolidation in China's pharmaceutical industry as players seek to cut costs.
For foreign drugmakers such as Merck and Pfizer, the picture is mixed. They are unlikely to be able to compete with domestic Chinese rivals in generic drugs on price alone. The real opportunity lies in patented, specialized drugs: The Chinese government has been approving foreign-made products at a record pace and has started including them in its lists of drugs that can be reimbursed under public insurance. Drugmakers may still have to accept price cuts to ensure they get on that list, but they are unlikely to face competition as severe as that in generics.
Change is coming to China's pharmaceutical sector, as Beijing grapples with some persistent sores in the country's health-care system. That means volatility ahead for pharma stocks--but plenty of opportunity for brave companies and investors, too.

November Trade Winds Blow China Off Course; China managed to shrug off slowing global growth for months. No longer--November trade data was unambiguously bad.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search. proquest.com/docview/2153565392?accountid=14586,"The trend is your friend, economists and investors love to say--unless it isn't.
Strong Chinese exports have, for months, managed to buck slowing global growth and rising trade tensions. Not anymore--November export data released on the weekend was the worst, excluding the holiday period around Lunar New Year, since late 2016. Import growth also slowed sharply, partly due to falling oil prices.
Economists have been expecting Chinese trade data to falter in line with the rest of the world for months. The fact that it finally has--and that exports to the U.S. held up better than elsewhere--hands additional leverage to President Trump's team as negotiations on a comprehensive trade deal with China shift into high gear.
For the weak numbers come as signs mount that China's economy is beginning to slow sharply . November's official purchasing managers index showed the factory sector on the verge of contraction for the first time since mid-2016 and the job market weakening in services and construction.
Falling imports of iron ore, copper and coal in November from a year earlier add to evidence that the construction sector, the big bright spot in China's economy in 2018, is now beginning to stumble. Last week, China's cabinet announced policies to support employment and consumption, including broader subsidies for the jobless and higher tax rebates for companies that don't lay off workers. Chinese policy makers are doubtless fuming about the arrest of Huawei scion Meng Wanzhou , but with the employment picture markedly deteriorating, they still have a strong incentive to avoid another trade blowup in early 2019.
For sure, there isn't much evidence that the trade conflict itself is the main problem for Chinese exports so far--instead, the culprit looks to be slower global growth , particularly in Europe. Chinese exports to the U.S. slowed in November but still rose 9.8% on the year, against 4.8% growth in shipments to Japan and 6% growth in Europe-bound shipments. In a sense, China is just catching up: Growth in Korean and Taiwanese exports has been trending down for months. Chinese exports likely held up better initially because of the cheaper yuan and frontloading in U.S.-bound shipments ahead of expected higher tariff rates.
Still-strong exports to the U.S. paired with marked deterioration everywhere else strengthens Mr. Trump's hand during this crucial 90-day negotiation period . The data also contains a warning, however--signs of rapidly slowing global growth are everywhere now. How long the U.S. can keep shrugging that off, particularly with its housing and financial markets struggling, is questionable. That strong negotiating position might look much more rickety before too long.

Warburg Pincus Plans $1 Billion Joint Venture in China; U.S. private-equity firm and Hande Group are looking to acquire properties in China's megacities,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2154628794?accountid=14586,"China's cooling, debt-laden property market is attracting global investors, with U.S. private-equity firm Warburg Pincus and a Chinese partner announcing a plan to plow $1 billion into distressed properties.
Warburg Pincus and Hande Group, a Beijing-based investment firm, said Wednesday they are looking to acquire properties sitting in the centers of China's megacities and the debt associated with those real estate-assets. Under their plan, the properties would be held for at least four or five years, either being directly managed or leased, Warburg said.
China's property market, once a red-hot driver of the economy, is at a turning point, as high debt and a slowing economy take hold. A government subsidy program that propped up home prices in smaller cities is scaling down next year, sapping growth potential. Developers loaded with debt are getting squeezed in a government campaign to reduce financial risk.
Though the ebullience seems to be ebbing faster in the housing market, as weaker sales and prices spread from big to smaller cities, investors are noticing signs of financial stress in commercial real estate and expect developers to unload properties.
""We will see a lot of opportunities,"" said Claire Tang, head of acquisitions for China at LaSalle Investment Management, who is looking to purchase big-city properties under development.
Debt is swelling in the property market, despite a government campaign in recent years to put a lid on risky borrowing. China's property market had 37.45 trillion yuan, or $5.4 trillion, of outstanding debt as of the third quarter, according to the People's Bank of China. The sum was more than 20% larger than a year earlier, though more than two-thirds of real-estate loans are home mortgages.
Warburg Pincus expects properties foundering under debt to proliferate. The partnership plans to expand their investment to $5 billion under management within three years. Earlier this year, Gaw Capital Partners, a Hong Kong private-equity firm, set up a $1 billion distressed-assets fund.
A spokeswoman declined to disclose further details about where the fund is investing.
Adding to the prospects, according to Warburg, is that courts are making it easier to acquire distressed properties at auction or after a court ruling on a lawsuit.""I would have been reticent to do this 10 years ago,"" said Joseph Gagnon, managing director and head of Asia real estate at Warburg Pincus. ""This is not a huge sector for a lot of people. But it is opening up.""
Mr. Gagnon said they would comb central areas of first-tier cities for poorly managed or underused properties. Old factories or hotels, for instance, could be transformed into service apartments, creative offices or new retail concepts, he said. ""We are long-term bulls of China,"" Mr. Gagnon said. ""This is not indicative of the sky is falling.""

"Canadian Michael Spavor Questioned in China Following Detention of Ex-Diplomat; Officials are trying to determine his whereabouts, raised case with China embassy","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2154862298?accountid=14586,"OTTAWA--Canada is aware of another case involving a Canadian man in China who faced questioning by authorities there and whose whereabouts are unknown, the country's foreign minister said Wednesday.
Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland revealed these details at a news conference in the nation's capital, where she and other officials provided an update on the next steps in the extradition process of Huawei Technologies Co. finance chief Meng Wanzhou. She also answered questions on what officials know about the detention in Beijing of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig.
""We are aware of a Canadian who got in touch with us because he was being asked questions by Chinese authorities,"" Ms. Freeland said. ""We have not been able to make contact with him since he let us know.""
Later Wednesday, Canadian officials identified the man as Michael Spavor. Mr. Spavor, 43 years old, has led academic, tourist and business delegations to North Korea through his nonprofit, Paektu Cultural Exchange. Calls to Mr. Spavor's mobile phone numbers didn't go through. He was most recently active on social media on Monday, when he said on Facebook and Twitter that he would be traveling to Seoul that day.
Ms. Freeland said officials are working to determine his whereabouts and she has raised the issue with China's ambassador in Ottawa. She said officials have been in touch with Mr. Spavor's family. An official at Canada's Chinese embassy declined to comment on Wednesday.
Mr. Spavor was scheduled to take a 2:05 p.m. flight from the Chinese city of Dalian to Incheon International Airport outside Seoul on Monday. Earlier on Monday, he boarded a train to Dalian from his home in Dandong, across the Yalu River from North Korea.
In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Spavor accompanied retired American basketball star Dennis Rodman to Pyongyang to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Over the course of the two trips, Messrs. Spavor and Kim became friends, according to Mr. Spavor's website.
Word of Mr. Spavor's status comes after Chinese authorities detained Mr. Kovrig. Senior Canadian officials say the embassy in Beijing found out early Wednesday that Mr. Kovrig was detained by China's bureau of state security on Monday. Officials are still trying to determine the exact nature of the allegations he faces, in addition to his whereabouts.
Two Chinese state-media outlets, both citing ""relevant"" departments, ran separate reports--one about Mr. Kovrig and the other about Mr. Spavor--saying they were placed under investigation Monday for allegedly ""engaging in activities that endanger China's national security,"" a sweeping allegation frequently used against Chinese dissidents. The allegation is also often applied to espionage cases.
Officials say Mr. Kovrig, who resides in Hong Kong, has yet to be given access to Canadian officials. International protocols suggest access must be granted in a timely manner. Once access is granted, diplomats can establish where he is being held and whether his detention conditions are suitable.
""The key is to ensure the Canadian national is not being treated any differently than any other citizen would in similar conditions in that country,"" said Dan McTeague, a former Canadian cabinet minister in charge of consular affairs.
Mr. Kovrig has been on leave from the Canadian diplomatic corps since 2016 and has served as a senior adviser with International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based nonprofit. A Canadian official said Mr. Kovrig has no diplomatic immunity because he is on unpaid leave.

""The fact that Mr. Kovrig is an employee of the department is relevant. He's well known by many people in the [foreign] department. We are very concerned about him,"" Ms. Freeland said, adding that she relayed this message to China's chief envoy in Ottawa.
""We will do everything in our power"" to seek his release, she said.
Mr. Kovrig's former boss at the Canadian embassy in Beijing, Guy Saint-Jacques, said he believes there is a link between his colleague's detention and the case of Huawei's Ms. Meng. Mr. Saint-Jacques said it is part of Beijing's effort to get Canada to release the Huawei executive.
Ms. Freeland said Chinese officials that she has spoken to ""have not described the situation with Mr. Kovrig as being a reprisal. It's important to note that.""

"Samsung Downsizes China Oper ations With Factory Closure; Company produces roughly one-third of its China-made phones at its manufacturing facility in Tianjin, analysts estimate","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2154945843?accountid=14586,"SEOUL--Samsung Electronics Co. plans to close a Chinese smartphone factory this month, as the South Korean technology giant shifts manufacturing to India and its sales flounder in China, the world's largest handset market.
Samsung will close its manufacturing facility in Tianjin, a northern port city near Beijing, by Dec. 31, a company spokesman said on Thursday.
The retrenchment appears to be unrelated to efforts by the U.S. to convince its allies, including South Korea, to restrict their dealings with China in the technology sector amid a geopolitical feud involving Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., a major competitor of Samsung's.
Some 2,000 Samsung employees were notified this week of the shuttering of the Tianjin facility, where analysts estimate Samsung produces roughly one-third of its China-made phones. Samsung, the world's largest smartphone maker, has a second handset factory in the southern Chinese city of Huizhou.
""China remains an important market for Samsung,"" the company said, pledging to continue investing in its Chinese factories. Samsung and its affiliates make batteries, memory chips and other electronic components in China. The Samsung spokesman declined to comment beyond the company statement.
As recently as five years ago, Samsung accounted for nearly one-fifth of smartphone shipments within China. But its share of the cutthroat market has fallen steadily, and now measures at less than 1%, according to Counterpoint Research. Chinese rivals, such as Huawei and Xiaomi Corp., have eaten into Samsung's business by offering many of the same phone features at lower prices.
While the Tianjin factory shutdown appears to be unrelated to the U.S.-China fight over Huawei, it comes as global companies like Samsung grapple with rising tensions between the world's two largest economies. Potential tariffs and geopolitical concerns could affect foreign companies with significant Chinese manufacturing operations.
Rising labor costs in China and global trade uncertainties were key factors in Samsung's decision this summer to allocate $700 million for the construction of the world's largest smartphone factory in India , where the company maintains a sizable foothold.
Samsung's manufacturing strategy contrasts with that of smartphone rival Apple Inc., which still relies heavily on China for production of its iPhones. Samsung, which supplies one out of every five smartphones shipped globally, has spread out its handset production.
Between 50% and 60% of the roughly 300 million Samsung handsets shipped annually are assembled in Vietnam, 20% to 30% in China and 10% in India, according to a July report by Simon Woo of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Following the expansion of the India facility, the percentage of Samsung phones made in China could eventually drop to about 10%, Mr. Woo estimated.
The lower exposure to China means that any tariffs applied to China-made smartphones ""would likely favor"" Samsung relative to Apple, according to a November report by Panjiva, the supply-chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. In September, Apple warned that it was vulnerable to tariffs that the Trump administration was considering for imports from China.
Samsung is hoping to stabilize its lucrative smartphone business after significant stumbles this year. The company's smartphone shipments fell 13% from a year earlier for the three months ended Sept. 30, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, outpacing an industrywide decline of 8%.
China has puzzled Samsung for years. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in 2016, when Samsung still accounted for about 8% of the Chinese phone market, mobile chief D.J. Koh said he believed the company had reached a turning point and expected a significant recovery in ""a couple of months, six months.""
In August of this year, Mr. Koh reiterated China's importance for Samsung and vowed to visit the country every month, according to South Korean media. ""Due to its size, the Chinese market is something we can never give up on,"" Mr. Koh said.
Separately, Samsung shuffled some of its senior executives this week, leaving in place its three co-chief executives--tasked with leading the company's mobile, consumer electronics and components divisions--but relieving one of its highest-ranking female executives of some duties.
Y.H. Lee, who headed Samsung's mobile marketing efforts, will leave that position to focus on leading the company's global marketing center, a job she held concurrently with her mobile responsibilities, according to people familiar with the matter.
The company also elevated Cheun Kyung-whoon to lead the unit that sells next-generation 5G network equipment, replacing Kim Young-ky, who will remain as an adviser. The Wall Street Journal last week reported on Mr. Kim's plans to step down and identified Mr. Cheun as the likely successor.
The 5G equipment unit is a key business for Samsung, as it looks to rapidly build sales as a global pushback against market leader Huawei over cybersecurity concerns picks up steam.

China's Mountain of U.S. Government Bonds Shrinks for Fifth Straight Month; China's holdings of U.S. Treasurys fell to $1.138 trillion in October,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2157703901?accountid=14586,"Chinese holdings of U.S. Treasurys are at their lowest levels in nearly a year and a half.
What's Happening
Data released on Monday showed China's holdings of U.S. government bonds dipped again in October, to $1.138 trillion. That is the fifth straight month of declines and the lowest total since May 2017.
On a rolling 12-month basis, a measure that smooths monthly volatility, Treasury holdings have fallen for two straight months.
The data covers holdings of U.S. Treasurys by all Chinese investors, but it is closely watched as a proxy for how Beijing is managing its larger $3 trillion mountain of currency reserves. U.S. sovereign bonds make up a significant portion of that buffer, but Beijing doesn't publish the exact composition of the reserves. China also holds some U.S. debt through custodial accounts abroad.
ASIA MARKETS SNAPSHOT
* The U.S. dollar fell 0.1% against the Chinese yuan in offshore markets, to 6.8962
* Asian equities followed U.S. markets lower, with Japan's Nikkei 225 down 1.8% and China's Shanghai Composite down 0.8%
* Brent crude oil dipped 2% to $58.45 per barrel
When the Chinese yuan has come under pressure before, the People's Bank of China has sold Treasurys to weaken the dollar and reinforce the yuan. So movements in China's Treasury holdings are scrutinized for signals Beijing is again intervening to prop up its currency. In 2015 and 2016, Chinese Treasury bondholdings fell by hundreds of billions of dollars amid a bout of capital flight.
Chinese holdings of Treasurys are still up from recent lows, of $1.049 trillion at the end of 2016, but are also well down from their late 2013 peak of $1.316 trillion.
What It Means
So far, the limited drawdown doesn't indicate the same aggressive intervention seen in 2015 and 2016. But with these reserves playing such a pivotal role in the global economy, analysts and investors keep a close eye on changes for their knock-on effect on the currency.
On Tuesday, the U.S. dollar fell 0.1% against the Chinese yuan in offshore markets, to 6.8962.
A major selldown would send U.S. yields higher, but analysts reckon that would harm China too, by lifting the yuan, roiling markets and eroding the value of its remaining dollar holdings .
The yuan is likely to fall in 2019, moving beyond seven to the dollar and ending the year at around 7.1, according to J.P. Morgan economists and strategists, driven largely by the trade dispute with the U.S. The strategists expect China's foreign-exchange reserves to shrink moderately, from $3.04 trillion at the end of this year to $2.89 trillion at the end of 2019.
Other analysts agree that the yuan will break past seven to the greenback; Daiwa Capital Markets, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs expect the currency to pass that level at some point in the next year.
The Chinese currency, which is also known as the renminbi, rallied earlier this month on a temporary truce on trade between the U.S. and Chinese governments, dropping from as high as 6.98 in November.
""Pressure on the renminbi may return in the coming months, however, given that we expect economic growth to cool further and U.S.-China interest rates to continue to move in opposite directions,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.

China and Hollywood have a love-hate relationship. Beijing is envious of Hollywood's cultural clout. Hollywood needs China--the world's second-largest movie market--but it resents Beijing's censorship, the low cut of ticket sales it gets, and the annual quota for foreign films.
Hollywood will probably never have a competitive advantage in making Chinese rom-coms, but it's the best in the business for spandex-clad heroes and creature features. In the Chinese market, maybe it should stick with what it does best.

China's Reform Without Opening; An economic shock--and pain for global markets--may be needed to restart stalled reform in China,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2158476057?accountid=14586,"""What we should and can reform, we will resolutely reform. What shouldn't be reformed and cannot be reformed, we will resolutely refrain from changing."" Not the tone optimists had been hoping for from Chinese President Xi Jinping, speaking this week 40 years after the launch of Deng Xiaoping's ""reform and opening up"" policy, which ignited China's economic miracle .
Real economic reform in China isn't dead, but its economy may need to get significantly worse before the leadership is convinced it has no other choice.
Given the severe stress China's private sector is under, with bond defaults at an all-time high and huge amounts of equity pledged as collateral for loans, Mr. Xi's speech was remarkably light on signals that Beijing is committed to turning things around for private companies.
The speech did urge ""unwavering"" support for the private economy, but only after calling for ""strengthening and developing the state-controlled economy."" Mr. Xi's speech mentioned the market only around one-fourth as often as President Hu Jintao's speech on reform and opening 10 years earlier, according to Capital Economics.
That all fits with a Xi administration that has embraced a vision of ""reform"" without much opening or markets . ""Supply-side reform,"" has mostly meant shutting down private factories to help state-owned competitors reap higher margins . On debt, regulators have shied away from allowing banks to freely compete for deposits with higher rates, which would force them to lend more to productive private companies, rather than safer state enterprises, to preserve margins. Instead, state-owned conglomerates have benefited from debt-to-equity swaps, while the campaign against shadow banking has starved the private sector of funding.
The good news is, that approach probably isn't sustainable. Private investment has rebounded modestly in 2018, but mostly due to the bubbly property market , which is likely to stumble in 2019. Profits are weakening and so is the labor market. And corporate leverage has rebounded to 164% of total output after leveling off in 2017, a sign that Beijing's heavy-handed approach to debt control isn't working. Administrative efforts to boost private companies and, thus, growth have mostly failed.
That could hand ammunition to economic reformers, particularly since the slowdown is coinciding with President Trump's pressure campaign . Scattershot new openings for foreign investors such as UBS and Tesla could be replaced with broader concessions on foreign ownership in finance, health care, entertainment and other key sectors, and even on sticking points such as intellectual property.
Much depends on how deep the downturn is next year, and how hard Mr. Trump's negotiators push . That creates a paradox for investors: Good news on China's opening is only likely to follow bad news on China's economy, which would hit global markets hard. Economic reform is overdue but could be surprisingly painful.

[ Click here to read The Timesâs five-part series, âChina Rules.â ]
âCountry Driving,â by Peter Hessler
Hesslerâs âCountry Drivingâ is an âexploration of Chinaâs burgeoning highway system, and it definitely contains some epic drives: Mr. Hessler, for example, undertakes a 7,000-mile trip across northern China, following the Great Wall all the way from the East China Sea to the Tibetan plateau, his rental car packed with a tent and food supplies that will make your teeth ache: Coca-Cola, Oreo cookies, candy bars, Gatorade.â
The big story here is that China is âa country thatâs feverishly on the move,â from âfarming and folkways, to new cities and their sprouting factories.â
âAge of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China,â by Evan Osnos
âAge of Ambitionâ is a âriveting and troubling portrait of a people in a state of extreme anxiety about their identity, values and future.â In the book, âOsnos paints a China rived by moral crisis and explosive frustration, whose citizens are desperate to achieve wealth, even as they are terrified of being left with nothing. The Communist Party leadership, Osnos writes, is so morally and intellectually bankrupt that only the uneasy bargain to provide âprosperity in exchange for loyaltyâ allows it to retain a semblance of legitimacy. Even so, âthe gap between the societyâs meritocratic myth and its oligarchic reality was becoming clear and measurable.ââ
âOut of Maoâs Shadow: The Struggle for the Soul of a New China,â by Philip P. Pan
Panâs âOut of Maoâs Shadowâ assesses the âcurrent state of the worldâs most populous nation, looking at both the growing personal freedom its citizens now enjoy and the Communist Partyâs continued monopoly on power. He notes that prosperity has raised peopleâs expectations and access to information, even as itâs helped the government forestall democratization: many citizens who might once have become dissidents have grown increasingly focused on their private lives and the opportunity to make money quickly, while party officials, who âcan often determine who succeeds and fails in the new capitalist economy,â wield âtremendous leverage over the emerging class of private businessmen and entrepreneurs that might otherwise support political change.ââ
âChina in Ten Words,â by Yu Hua
âChina in Ten Wordsâ is a collection of essays in which Yu Hua âdepicts a morally compromised nation, plagued by escalating unemployment, class polarization and endemic corruption and waste. At the extremes, peasants traverse the land selling their blood to the highest bidder while multimillionaires build mansions that are replicas of the White House.â
âSix Chapters From My Life Downunder,â by Yang Jiang
âIn richness, moral urgency and drama, there can be few events of history with greater literary potential than the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Yang Jiang âs âSix Chapters from My Life Downunder ,â her slender account of being sent âdownâ for two years to a re-education school in the countryside, is one of the few memoirs of the period and all the more precious for that.â
âThe Corpse Walker: China From the Bottom Up,â by Liao Yiwu
âThe Corpse Walkerâ a collection of conversations, is an âindustrious, well-crafted recording of oral histories, almost all from the southwestern province of Sichuan. â¦ an area of extremes: mountains and plains, industry and farms, the newly rich and the perpetually poor. Its continuum of orthodoxy slides between animism, Taoism, Maoist atheism and the quasi capitalism of its favorite son, Deng Xiaoping.â
âThe China Mission: George Marshallâs Unfinished War, 1945-1947,â by Daniel Kurtz-Phelan
âKurtz-Phelanâs book, âThe China Mission,â tells the story of Marshallâs unsuccessful mission to China. Thoroughly researched and compellingly written, it is at once a revealing study of character and leadership, a vivid reconstruction of a critical episode in the history of the early Cold War and an insightful meditation on the limits of American power even at its peak.â
âA Force So Swift: Mao, Truman and the Birth of Modern China,â by Kevin Peraino
âPerainoâs absorbing book covers that tipping-point year, 1949, when Mao Zedongâs Chinese Communist Party came to power and things not only changed radically within China, but also for Chinese-American relations. After several decades of close ties to Chiang Kai-shekâs Nationalists, including a wartime alliance, the United States plunged first into Cold War with China and then hot war (in Korea), followed by several decades of almost complete diplomatic separation.â
âA Contest for Supremacy: China, America, and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia,â by Aaron L. Friedberg
âIn âA Contest for Supremacyâ Friedberg outlines several reasons a closer relationship between the two powers is possible: economic interdependence, the prospect that China may become more open and democratic, its continuing integration into the international system, common threats like climate change , and nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, he believes two other factors â a growing clash of interests and deep ideological and political differences â will prove more decisive and will make the relationship more tense and competitive.â
âOn China,â by Henry Kissinger
Kissinger was not only the first official American emissary to Communist China , he persisted in his brokerage with more than 50 trips over four decades, spanning the careers of seven leaders on each side. Diplomatically speaking, he owns the franchise; and with âOn China,â â¦ he reflects on his remarkable run.
âThe Cultural Revolution: A Peopleâs History, 1962-1976,â by Frank Dikotter
âDikotterâs gripping, horrific and at times sensationalistic âThe Cultural Revolution: A Peopleâs History, 1962-1976,â the third volume of his work on the Mao years, challenges the Chinese people to address those missing years. Drawn from hundreds of English-language and Chinese eyewitness accounts, newly available archival records, online Cultural Revolution documentary projects and foreign and Chinese scholarship, the book paints â¦ a damning portrait of Mao and Communist Party governance.â
âWealth and Power: Chinaâs Long March to the 21st Century,â by Orville Schell and John Delury
In this book, Schell and Delury âargue that for generations of influential Chinese, shame has been a stimulant.â Their examination of how this âunusual trait in Chinese culture worked its way through politics and intellectual life is a fascinating attempt to reconcile Chinaâs current success with its past suffering. It also sets the stage for perhaps the biggest challenge facing a much wealthier and more powerful China today, since it cannot go on fighting its vanquished ghosts forever.â
âImperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of Chinaâs Last Golden Age,â by Stephen Platt
âPlatt has written an enthralling account of the run-up to war between Britain and China during a century in which wealth and power were shifting inexorably from East to West. But if this history holds a lesson today â as wealth and power shift equally inexorably back from West to East â it is surely the same one that Karl Marx identified just a decade after the Opium War, that men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please.â
âFactory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China,â by Leslie T. Chang
âThe emergence of Chinaâs titanic manufacturing base has been chronicled in numerous books and articles in recent years, but Chang has elected to focus not on the broader market forces at play but on the individuals, most of them women, who leave their villages and seek their fortunes on the front lines of this economy.â
âLeftover Women: The Resurgence of Gender Inequality in China,â by Leta Hong Fincher
In âLeftover Women,â Fincher argues that women in China âare pressed to accept unsuitable marriages while in their mid-20s. The state, alarmed by gender imbalances and the potential for unattached men to create social unrest, has allied with insecure parents to describe them as âleftoverâ if they delay, she says. The women are systematically deprived of homeownership because of parental and spousal pressure to put real estate in the husbandâs name, even if the woman, or her parents, has contributed significantly to the purchase.â
âOne Child: The Story of Chinaâs Most Radical Experiment,â by Mei Fong
âOne Childâ examines how âthe repercussions of population control will continue to reverberate throughout China.â The bookâs greatest strength is Fongâs reporting. She âmeets Liang Zhongtang, who fruitlessly attempted to dissuade Chinaâs leaders from adopting the policy in the 1980s. She interviews people at adoption agencies that are suspected of seizing second children and selling them to Westerners.â She highlights earthquakes and other natural disasters and shows âhow unexpected are the tragedies of Chinaâs population policy.â
âLittle Soldiers: An American Boy, a Chinese School, and the Global Race to Achieve,â by Lenora Chu
âChina is such a vast, contradictory land that the most illuminating books often explore it through an intense focus on a single topic â¦ Education is a particularly transparent window, as demonstrated by the perceptive âLittle Soldiers,â which turns over cultural rocks from bribery to the urban-rural divide while delving into the nationâs school system, deeply rooted as it is in both ancient Confucianism and Communist dogma.â
There are countless other good books on China. For instance: âWild Swans,â by Jung Chang; Ian Johnsonâs âThe Souls of Chinaâ; Richard McGregorâs âThe Partyâ; âFrom Heaven Lake,â by Vikram Seth; Jonathan Spenceâs âMao Zedongâ and Peter Hopkirkâs âTrespassers on the Roof of the World.â Let us know in the comments below if you have a favorite."
Think Local When It Comes to China's Debt; One of the biggest areas of vulnerability in China's huge debt pile is bonds issued by investment vehicles linked to local governments.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2018,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2161739936?accountid=14586,"All politics is local, runs the old saw. In China, local governments lie at the root of the country's debt problem--a problem likely only to grow in 2019.
Most analysts see the Chinese government's relatively low debt--equivalent to around 16% of GDP at the end of 2017, according to Moody's--as a strength. But add in both official local government debt, and debt issued by off-balance sheet financing vehicles backed by local governments--known as LGFVs--and that ratio climbs to 60% of GDP.
These LGFVs, which started sprouting up after the global financial crisis, have become an area of huge vulnerability. Back then, Chinese local governments were restricted from issuing their own debt, but still needed to stoke the economy. The solution: set up off-balance sheet vehicles which could issue debt, often collateralized with local government-owned land, and spend the money raised on big investment projects.
In recent years, local governments have become freer to sell their own official debt, but they still face centrally-imposed limits on how much they can issue. With tax revenues declining as Chinese growth slows, and another of local governments' big income sources--land sales--highly volatile, they face an annual funding gap equivalent to around 10% of China's GDP, Moody's reckons.
This persistent revenue shortage has left local governments still reliant on LGFVs to keep issuing debt to fund investment. LGFV bond issuance has grown rapidly this decade; and despite a dip last year, it reaccelerated in the first half of 2018.
Cracks in this system are starting to show. A big concern is that many of the investments LGFVs have made over the years can't and won't generate adequate returns. Beijing's crackdown on shadow banking has put the squeeze on investing entities that have been big buyers of LGFV debt. In turn, funding costs have been rising, particularly for lower-rated LGFVs, meaning interest payments are becoming an ever greater proportion of local government spending, particularly in poorer areas of China.
A big question now is who will bear the fallout if--as many analysts expect--LGFVs start defaulting on bond payments in big numbers. Investors have long assumed these financing vehicles have implicit backing from local governments and, ultimately the central government. Beijing, though, has been trying to dispel that impression, with a series of measures imposed to cut the potential support from local governments to the LGFVs.
If Chinese regulators allow a spate of defaults on debt long believed to be quasi-government, confidence in China's bond market--vast swaths of which are priced as if they have Beijing's ultimate backing--could plummet. Conversely, heavy government bailouts would lead to a reassessment of Chinese central government debt levels, and hence a potential repricing of government bonds.
Either way, the hangover from China's local government debt binge is about to get very interesting.

"Apple Beware: Samsung's Great Fall in China Was Swift; In five years, Samsung went from China's No. 1 to less than 1% market share","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2162997432?accountid=14586,"SEOUL--Apple Inc.'s recently revealed stumble in China is an all-too-familiar story for smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co.
Five years ago, the South Korean technology giant sat atop the Chinese market, selling nearly one of every five devices there. Today, Samsung is an also-ran, controlling less than 1% of the world's largest smartphone market. Samsung has trimmed local staff and last month closed one of its two Chinese smartphone factories .
Though few expect Apple's sales decline in China to be as dramatic, Samsung's comedown offers a cautionary tale for foreign smartphone makers.
Samsung, which remains the world's largest smartphone maker, was outmaneuvered by Chinese rivals that sold comparable devices at lower prices. The company's decline was exacerbated by a 2016 global recall of Galaxy Note 7 devices with overheating batteries that tarnished its brand. Geopolitics also interceded when Seoul's installation of a U.S. missile-defense system upset Beijing, leading to a Chinese consumer backlash against South Korean brands.
Apple's China sales overtook Samsung in 2015, accounting for 14% of the country's shipments, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple has since slipped back, as Huawei Technologies Co. and other domestic smartphone makers grabbed market share by offering similar designs and features for lower prices.
Apple made a surprise cut to its revenue forecast on Wednesday citing soft sales in China. Still, it stands in better shape than Samsung in that market. The Apple brand retains cachet among some wealthier Chinese consumers and has been holding its market share steady; plus, the company makes iPhones in China, employing vast numbers of workers.
A Samsung spokesman declined to comment. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Samsung's inability to revive China sales highlights what has been rough going for the company. Its smartphone shipments overall are down by double-digit percentages--worse than the industrywide slump--and in the latest quarter operating profit for the mobile unit declined by a third.
""Samsung has just lost the plot in China,"" said Sanjeev Rana, a Seoul-based senior analyst at brokerage CLSA. ""I don't think they are in any position to get back either.""
Apple's predicament in China varies from Samsung's in several key ways, smartphone industry experts say.
The iPhone uses the Apple-developed iOS operating system, so jumping to rival brands is more onerous than it is for owners of Samsung phones, which run on Google's Android. That said, the Apple ecosystem's hold is diminished for many Chinese consumers because they spend a large chunk of their time inside WeChat, a chat, payments and social-media app from Tencent Holdings Ltd.
Also, iPhones may not be the status symbol they once were, but Apple can still lean heavily on its branding, said Mark Natkin, managing director at Marbridge Consulting in Beijing.
Shopping at a mall in central Shanghai on Friday, Wang Yu, a 33-year-old who works in foreign trade, said he would buy an iPhone if he had enough money. At present, though, his choice was Samsung or Huawei, which is his current brand.
""A lot of people love the country, and want to use Chinese brand phones,"" Mr. Wang said. But he is most swayed by battery life. A Samsung device he used years ago had battery issues after a year, he said. ""I used my Huawei for over two years now, but it never froze up,"" said Mr. Wang, who will likely stick with the Chinese brand.
Whereas South Korean companies took a hit in China after Seoul defied Beijing on the missile-defense system, Apple so far has escaped a consumer backlash amid the U.S.-China trade feud. China faces more political risk with the U.S. than with South Korea should the government foment a campaign against buying Apple products.
""If patriotism cooks up, who knows what could happen?"" said Tom Kang, an analyst at Counterpoint Research.
Samsung has adjusted its phones strategy amid its struggles in China and a broader sales decline driven by consumers balking at $1,000-plus prices and shrugging off new features.
In recent months, Samsung has stuffed its best new hardware in middle-tier handsets geared for growing markets such as India. The company has historically reserved such features for its flagship devices, like the Galaxy S or Note phones.
The November release of its Galaxy A9, which costs about $530, was the first handset to have four cameras installed on the device's back.
Samsung is also spending $700 million to build the world's largest smartphone factory in India, where the South Korean firm remains one of the largest players.
Apple in recent weeks started to offer discounts in China for trade-ins with used phones, according to its website. For its new iPhone XR, Apple is offering a discount of up to nearly a third, which would put the handset's lowest available price at 4,399 yuan ($640). For the iPhone XS, the discount is as much as a quarter of the original price, taking its price as low as 6,599 yuan ($960).
Apple's higher-end phone sales have been more resilient in China, according to some analysts, and top-of-the-line products are where Samsung is placing its hopes of winning back Chinese consumers.
Samsung is preparing a major technological upgrade this year for its 10th anniversary flagship phones, including a next-generation 5G phone that features six cameras, The Wall Street Journal reported in November. The company is also preparing mass production of a foldable-screen phone that will be 7.3 inches when opened.

Trade Tensions Take a Toll on China's Economy; China's manufacturing slowdown comes as the country gears up for new talks with the U.S.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2163 689146?accountid=14586,"SHENZHEN--China's economy is slowing faster than expected as Beijing this week heads into a crucial new round of negotiations with the U.S. over trade.
For the past couple of months, senior Chinese officials have sought to play down the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on the world's second-largest economy, telling the public the conflict is doing little more than hurting the nation's stock indexes, making it a good time to buy China again.
Behind the scenes, officials in the gated Zhongnanhai leadership compound are coming to a stark conclusion, according to people involved in the discussions: The trade dispute is short-circuiting growth.
The Trump administration's trade offensive, say the people and business executives, is hitting China's export-oriented manufacturing sector especially hard, reducing new orders for business and forcing factories to cut production and delay decisions on investing and hiring.
Beijing has been trying for years to make the economy less manufacturing dependent and more oriented toward domestic services. Still, the factory sector accounts for a little less than a third of all economic output.
In December, both big, state-owned companies and small, private ones reported a drop in new orders, resulting in an official measure of factory activity hitting its lowest level in nearly three years . Profits from big Chinese industrial firms, official data show, also declined in November for the first time in three years.
In the southern province of Guangdong, the country's export hub for electronics, chemicals and auto parts, the local government was recently forced by the National Bureau of Statistics to suspend publication of a monthly indicator of regional manufacturing activity that had been trending lower. Beijing said the province lacked permission to produce the local survey of factories, which has been publishing since 2011.
""The purchasing managers' survey conducted by the Guangdong Department of Industry and Information Technology was an illegal activity,"" the statistics bureau said in a statement.
Small, private entrepreneurs, already struggling with higher costs of funding compared with bigger state-owned enterprises, are bearing a large share of the manufacturing slowdown.
""We didn't feel anything even during the 2008 global financial crisis,"" said Shao Danping, an engineer-turned-entrepreneur who owns a Shenzhen factory that makes printing devices. Now machines in the three-story facility are largely sitting idle, and half of the factory's first floor has been rented out to another company. Her products haven't been hit directly by tariffs, but potential customers are looking outside China for suppliers, she said. ""The trade war is really killing our business.""
The slowdown goes beyond manufacturing. Chinese consumers have cut back, resulting in a slump in sales of cars and other goods. Apple Inc. reported a sales shortfall last week in part because of troubles in China . Meanwhile, despite being prodded by Beijing to spend again on infrastructure and other big-ticket projects, many local governments are already stretched after years of spending on debt-driven projects.
Some government advisers and economists estimate that China's officially recorded growth rate in the fourth quarter fell below 6.5%, a figure disputed by many analysts and investors. While that is high by global standards, it would be the weakest pace of growth since the financial crisis.
Growth will slow even further in the coming months, say some economic advisers to China's policy makers.
""The economy undoubtedly faces greater downward pressure,"" says one of the Beijing advisers. ""How bad it will become, and how strongly we should stimulate the economy will largely depend on how soon we can settle the trade dispute with the U.S.""
The slowdown could give Mr. Xi's advisers a greater sense of urgency to hash out a trade deal with U.S. negotiators when the two sides sit down in Beijing this week. Just a few months ago, when the economy was still performing within expectations, Mr. Xi had adopted a largely bare-knuckle approach to Washington's trade-clash escalations , vowing to match President Trump's tariff threats dollar for dollar.
The new round of negotiations follows a trade truce agreed by Messrs. Trump and Xi in Argentina on Dec. 1. Under that agreement, the U.S. is suspending tariff increases on $200 billion of Chinese imports until March.
China has pledged to cut tariffs , buy more U.S. goods and services, ease restrictions on foreign firms operating in China and further open sectors for foreign capital. Chinese officials also indicate that Beijing is willing to put in place a mechanism for measuring how it implements those promises. But details of a full trade pact are yet to be worked out.

"How China Could Challenge the Boeing-Airbus Duopoly; Investors overestimated the competitive chances of Bombardier and Embraer, but now risk underestimating the threat posed by China","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2163745481?accountid=14586,"Boeing and Airbus are very close to neutralizing all threats to their duopoly--with one exception. In time, a Chinese challenger could have the scale necessary to compete in the $190 billion commercial aviation market.
Boeing is in talks to buy an 80% stake in the commercial aircraft division of Brazilian manufacturer Embraer for $4.2 billion. Terms were approved last month, though the deal still needs approval from the Brazilian government. New President Jair Bolsonaro sent mixed messages Friday, telling reporters the merger was good while also expressing concern about losing control.
Boeing's interest in Embraer is a response to Airbus' purchase of the 108-to-133 seater CSeries --renamed A220--from Canadian manufacturer Bombardier. If completed, the latest deal would take out the industry's last small player.
Only five years ago, the dominance of Boeing and Airbus looked shaky. Bombardier and Embraer ruled the under-100 seat regional jet market, and the launch of the CSeries threatened the 100-to-150 seat models of the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A319. This was the duopoly's first real competition since Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
Back then, investors overestimated the disruptors' chances in a market where economies of scale reign supreme. Now they may be underestimating the threat posed by Chinese aviation, which lags behind in technology but has scale.
Through aggressive discounts, Boeing and Airbus created large losses for Bombardier. In 2008, the Canadian company expected demand for planes with 100 to 150 seats to top 6,300 orders by 2027, but the CSeries has only gotten 402 orders so far. Embraer's E-Jet E2 series was careful to keep a lower profile, but margins also buckled under pressure.
Boeing and Airbus should get more credit from investors for taking out their competition at a reasonable price. Leveraging their heft and service capabilities is key to their dominance. Right after Airbus took over the CSeries a big airline like JetBlue said it would buy 60 of them , and last week confirmed it had placed a firm order. And Embraer's Brazil-based engineers increase Boeing's chances of designing a profitable new midsize plane.
For all their growing pains, Bombardier and Embraer could have turned into serious challengers had they been allowed to expand with more time and more government assistance. This should also be a cautionary tale.
The C919, designed by China's Comac to rival the A320 and 737, started flying last year. The threat looks deceptively distant because the duopoly have better products.
Yet before 1987 Boeing also saw Airbus as an overly subsidized inferior competitor. Then the A320 hit the market: State-fueled growth had turned Airbus into an equal.
China's pockets are large, too. A conservative estimate for public money spent on the C919 is above $7 billion, according to U.S. think tank Rand Corp. That's more than the CSeries cost to develop, and on par with the A320 once adjusted for inflation. Unlike Bombardier, Comac has a huge domestic market--the C919 already has about 1,000 orders from Chinese airlines--and could easily expand across Asia, Russia and Africa.
Boeing and Airbus have made the right moves. But competition from China may be knocking on their gates sooner than they expect.

"China's Yuan Plays Fed, Trump Roulette; It's the luck of the draw again for China's central bank","Wall Street Jou rnal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/216 6005280?accountid=14586,"U.S. investors have been hanging on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's every word. Yi Gang, the head of China's central bank, probably is too.
China's currency, the yuan, which had a rough 2018, has started off 2019 rather well. It is up about 3% since early December, having gained 0.6% on Friday alone to hit 6.75 to the dollar. Part of that jump is related to signs of softening trade tensions with the U.S., with Chinese economics czar Liu He now expected to be in Washington at the end of the month for further talks.
The real swing factor for China's currency is probably the Fed, however, not the White House. Back in 2016, China's economy--under pressure from big capital outflows and rising defaults--got a huge boost from the Fed's decision to hold fire on rate increases for most of that year. It's starting to look like China, and the yuan, might get lucky again in 2019.
Other factors have helped support the yuan despite further evidence in recent weeks that China's economy is weakening. Even though the yield premium for holding Chinese sovereign bonds over their U.S. counterparts has been steadily narrowing the past year, foreign investors have still been piling into Chinese government bonds. They were one of the very few assets to do well in late 2018--a Bloomberg Barclays ETF tracking Chinese sovereign debt is up 4% since the end of third-quarter 2018. China has been gradually opening its bond markets wider, and the coming inclusion of its sovereign bonds in a key global benchmark this spring should help keep demand strong.
A more dovish Fed and the recent pullback in U.S. yields could give China's central bank still more room to ease monetary policy further without risking big capital outflows. All the more so if Chinese negotiators can secure a trade deal with President Trump.
Much depends on how bad things get in China domestically this year--and how aggressively the People's Bank of China needs to ease in response. So far, officials are signaling that stimulus measures will be focused more on consumer tax cuts and fiscal support for infrastructure, rather than another gargantuan credit splurge that would pressure the yuan.
China may get lucky once again.

How China Exploits Anti-Soviet Money Policy; The dollar's role as the global reserve currency has let China become the world's factory floor.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2169069312?accountid=14586,"In its quest to dominate global markets, China is upending the rules that make them run in the first place. Beijing's mercantilist strategy--using revenue from cheap exports to finance railways, ports and other footholds in its client states--is disrupting the international trade system. Left unchecked, China's tactics will continue hampering developing economies while also displacing workers in the U.S. and other rich countries.
The modern global-trade system was born at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, when the U.S. persuaded its developed peers to make their currencies convertible to U.S. dollars. The change boosted global demand for dollars, causing the price of American exports to rise. The overvalued exchange rate was fixed until the U.S. dumped the gold exchange standard in 1971 once claims on the gold stock had been exhausted, spiking more demand for the U.S. dollar. Since then the price of U.S. exports has risen relative to its peers, and trade deficits have become a fact of American life.
Throughout the Cold War, the dollar's reserve-currency status was in many ways mutually beneficial for the U.S. and its allies. Developing trade partners like Japan and West Germany reaped surpluses, and the U.S. borrowed back those funds to sustain its military ventures overseas. Congress ran deficits to finance a global security fortress, while American investment banks made markets for dollar-denominated debt across the world.
Yet when the Cold War wound down and U.S. priorities shifted, American leaders failed to update that system. China had begun trading globally in 1978, and its cheap-labor advantage allowed it to dominate the world export market by the early 2000s. But the U.S. continued to borrow back the dollars it spent on imports, even though defending the free world from communism no longer topped its budget.
The degradation of America's export prowess has continued steadily. The period from 2000 to 2010 saw a 50% spike in the U.S. goods-trading deficit and the loss of one-third of domestic manufacturing jobs. The price of industrial production has risen faster in America than in other large countries, and the offshoring of industries such as textiles, furniture and computer chips has accelerated. Well-paid 9-to-5 jobs with no need of advanced education have gone from common to coveted.

How China Exploits Anti-Soviet Money Policy; The dollar's role as the global reserve currency has let China become the world's factory floor.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2169131089?accountid=14586,"In its quest to dominate global markets, China is upending the rules that make them run in the first place. Beijing's mercantilist strategy--using revenue from cheap exports to finance railways, ports and other footholds in its client states--is disrupting the international trade system. Left unchecked, China's tactics will continue hampering developing economies while also displacing workers in the U.S. and other rich countries.
The modern global-trade system was born at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, when the U.S. persuaded its developed peers to make their currencies convertible to U.S. dollars. The change boosted global demand for dollars, causing the price of American exports to rise. The overvalued exchange rate was fixed until the U.S. dumped the gold exchange standard in 1971 once claims on the gold stock had been exhausted, spiking more demand for the U.S. dollar. Since then the price of U.S. exports has risen relative to its peers, and trade deficits have become a fact of American life.
Throughout the Cold War, the dollar's reserve-currency status was in many ways mutually beneficial for the U.S. and its allies. Developing trade partners like Japan and West Germany reaped surpluses, and the U.S. borrowed back those funds to sustain its military ventures overseas. Congress ran deficits to finance a global security fortress, while American investment banks made markets for dollar-denominated debt across the world.
Yet when the Cold War wound down and U.S. priorities shifted, American leaders failed to update that system. China had begun trading globally in 1978, and its cheap-labor advantage allowed it to dominate the world export market by the early 2000s. But the U.S. continued to borrow back the dollars it spent on imports, even though defending the free world from communism no longer topped its budget.
The degradation of America's export prowess has continued steadily. The period from 2000 to 2010 saw a 50% spike in the U.S. goods-trading deficit and the loss of one-third of domestic manufacturing jobs. The price of industrial production has risen faster in America than in other large countries, and the offshoring of industries such as textiles, furniture and computer chips has accelerated. Well-paid 9-to-5 jobs with no need of advanced education have gone from common to coveted.
The dollar's role as the global reserve currency has let China become the world's factory floor. Leveraging its dominant position in global trade, Beijing has been able to steal intellectual property, conduct cyberwarfare and export deadly products like opioids. An international arrangement that was conceived of as a way to build U.S. allies into a bulwark against Soviet aggression has been co-opted by a different communist power to extract wealth from America.

"China's Plan for Tech Dominance Is Advancing, Business Groups Say; Critical report on 'Made in China 2025' issued as U.S.-China trade talks are set to resume next week","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2169257987?accountid=14586,"Two influential U.S. business groups have issued a report detailing how China is moving ahead with a technology policy set to be a key point of contention in the U.S.-China trade talks that resume next week in Washington.
In a joint report to the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in China say Beijing's ambitious plan to become a global technology leader is being widely implemented, casting doubt on efforts by Chinese officials to play down its significance.
There is evidence of ""a deep, concerted and continuing effort"" by provincial officials to pursue the central government's Made in China 2025 plan, which seeks to make China a leader in electric vehicles, aerospace, robotics and other frontiers of manufacturing, the two business groups say.
The report comes as negotiators for the U.S. and China prepare to continue trade talks in Washington Jan. 30.
The chambers wield clout with the White House as representatives of American companies doing business in China, many of whom are reluctant to criticize Beijing publicly.
The business associations also have influence among China's leaders as longtime advocates of closer U.S.-China business ties. To that audience, their report reinforces a message U.S. business leaders have been trying to convey to Beijing: China can no longer take U.S. business-group support for granted.
The USTR's investigation into Chinese trade practices last year concluded that Made in China 2025 created an unfair playing field for American companies, including by making their trade secrets vulnerable to Chinese competitors.
Under pressure from the U.S., Chinese officials have agreed to redraft the plan. Xin Guobin, vice minister of industry and information technology, conceded in a news briefing last week ""the need to improve the policy system.""
But Beijing negotiators also say the U.S. has exaggerated the significance of Made in China. Vice Premier Liu He, Beijing's top trade envoy to the U.S., has played down the importance of the plan in meetings with U.S. business groups, participants say.
The chambers' report was delivered last week to USTR and obtained by The Wall Street Journal. It advocates structural reforms to further open Chinese markets for foreign companies, including an end to forced transfer of trade secrets.
A spokesman for the USTR declined to comment on the report. The USTR's own March 2018 report, which alleges China has forced U.S. firms to hand over technology to Chinese partners, mentions the Made in China 2025 program 120 times. But it doesn't show how the program is being put into effect around the country, a topic the report by the two chambers of commerce examines in detail.
The business groups' 142-page report is silent on one of President Trump's main goals--reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China--but devotes 32 pages to how the Made in China plan is being rolled out nationwide.
In Guangdong province near Hong Kong, the report says local officials have solicited companies to become ""backbone"" robotics enterprises, create ""secure and reliable"" next-generation information-technology systems, and establish the region as a Made in China 2025 ""demonstration zone.""
The rust-belt province of Liaoning, meanwhile, has preferential tax policies for advanced manufacturing and for scientific investment, according to the report.
The report gives U.S. negotiators more evidence to press for changes during talks with the Chinese delegation, which are to be led by Mr. Liu. The U.S. has suspended until March 1 plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from the current 10%, while the two sides carry on talks.
The chambers' report focuses on the specifics needed to change China's economy so U.S. companies compete more fairly, giving ammunition, however to those who worry Mr. Trump will settle for promises by China to buy more U.S. goods and services and largely ignore structural changes. In midlevel negotiations in Beijing earlier this month, about half the time was taken up on prospective purchases, negotiators say.
The chambers don't push--or even mention--additional U.S. exports. ""Purchases may be important to this administration, but in terms of [fundamental reform] going forward, purchases are not the answer,"" said Jeremie Waterman, head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's China Center.
Among other recommendations, the report advocates the creation of a new international arbitration system to resolve complaints by U.S. companies that believe they were mistreated in China. That could be a tough sell to both governments, as the Trump administration has tried to reduce the power of international bodies and China could object to a system that overrules its judiciary.

China Replaces Top Securities Regulator Amid Market Weakness; Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Chairman Yi Huiman to become head of the top securities regulator,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2171191250?accountid=14586,"BEIJING--China replaced its top securities regulator with a senior banker, as authorities look for ways to boost market sentiment amid a broad economic slowdown .
Yi Huiman, chairman of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, will be the new chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, replacing Liu Shiyu, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Saturday, citing a decision by China's top leadership.
Mr. Yi, 54, started leading ICBC, the nation's largest bank by assets and most profitable lender, in 2016. He is known within the banking industry for enforcing strong risk controls, according to people familiar with him.
Investors had been calling for a change. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 25% last year, while China's Shenzhen index fell even more. Some Chinese economists estimate that as much as 15% of last year's plunge in the Shanghai index was due to trade tensions with the U.S., which increased uncertainty over China's economic outlook.
Liu Shiyu, also a former banker, had been put in place to turn a new page for China's stock market after a 2015 crash. Many investors believe China's government ultimately controls the markets, a sentiment reinforced after state-backed investors and funds stepped in to stabilize trading after the mid-2015 meltdown.
Since then, officials have taken steps to loosen their hold on the market, and Beijing pledged to let foreign firms take bigger stakes in Chinese securities ventures.
But the market remains stuck at a multiyear low, and some investors have felt the regulator didn't make enough progress in market reforms. A push to lure big Chinese tech firms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to list on the mainland also stalled.
Some investors felt Mr. Liu still preferred guiding the market with a heavy hand, stifling companies' ability to use the stock market as a refinancing channel. He was known to use unusually strong rhetoric against suspected market manipulators, warning that his commission was on the watch for ""barbarians"" and ""big capitalist crocodiles.""
Markets rose whenever there were rumors that Mr. Liu would leave his post. Disgruntled investors even turned to an official Chinese social-media account of the U.S. Embassy to vent their frustrations, calling out Mr. Liu by name. The embassy was forced to turn off some comment functions.
Mr. Liu couldn't be reached for comment Saturday.
Maintaining investor confidence will be a key task for Mr. Yi.
""I'm sure he's fairly competent because he worked his way from the bottom,"" said an economist at a Chinese brokerage firm, referring to Mr. Yi, who started his career as a junior staff at a local bank. That said, it might have been good to promote someone from within the securities regulator itself who specializes in markets, the economist added.
China's economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades last year. Beijing has stepped up its efforts to spur growth by pumping more funds into financial markets and jump-starting infrastructure projects.
The appointment had been widely anticipated in recent days. Mr. Liu, who took the helm of the securities regulator in early 2016, will move to the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, a little-known financial organization, according to state media.

Manufacturers Take a Sales Hit in China; U.S. factories face weaker global trade as China's economy slows to its lowest growth rate since 1990,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2171345914?accountid=14586,"A growing number of industrial companies said their sales are softening in China, threatening a strong three-year run for U.S. manufacturers.
Makers of everything from bulldozers to computer chips have bet heavily on expanding their business in a country of 1.4 billion people with an increasing appetite for world-class consumer goods and infrastructure. U.S. exports to China doubled over the decade through 2017 to $130 billion a year, according to the Census Bureau.
Now that opportunity has become a potential liability for some companies as China's economy slows to its lowest rate of growth since 1990 .
""China is weaker than normal, weaker than seasonal,"" Keith Jackson, chief executive of ON Semiconductor Corp., said earlier this month.
Industrial bellwethers Caterpillar Inc. and 3M Co., which both make about one-tenth of their sales in China, are set to report their latest earnings Monday and Tuesday. The companies said in October that they were concerned about China's slowing economy , sparking a selloff in their shares and the broader U.S. industrials sector.
Industrial glue maker H.B. Fuller Co., which gets about 13% of its sales from China, said weaker demand there had cut $10 million off its profit in 2018 and would likely reduce profit by $20 million this year.
""We had estimated weakness in China,"" Chief Executive James Owens said. ""It was actually worse than we expected.""
PPG Industries Inc. said sales of its coatings for cars made in China fell 15% in the fourth quarter. Tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc. said it expects slower economic growth this year in China and most of the rest of the world.
The slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy is hurting some small U.S. firms too. Horween Leather Co., a Chicago tannery that exports about 40% of its premium hides to luxury shoe and luggage makers in China and elsewhere, saw sales decline about 10% last year. Company president Skip Horween is slowing production to reflect the lower demand.
""I think there's a period of adjustment coming,"" Mr. Horween said.
Other manufacturers that get most of their sales in the U.S. said business remains strong.
Orders rose about 15% last year at Atlas Tool Works, an Illinois parts maker with 70 employees and about $9 million in annual sales. Rising Pentagon spending has trickled down in more orders for the parts Atlas sells to defense contractors including Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co.
""We're really busy,"" said Zach Mottl, a fourth-generation executive at the family-owned firm. ""We're seeing some really nice uptick in demand.""
U.S. factory output in the third quarter reached its highest point since the financial crisis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Manufacturers have added a half-million jobs in the past two years, a 4% increase.
But recent weaker demand in China and other countries is threatening that stretch of strong performance.
A U.S. factory-activity index fell further than expected in December, according to the Institute for Supply Management. A subset of the index that measures new export orders was at a two-year low, suggesting softer sales abroad for many of the hundreds of companies that participate in the survey.
China isn't the only problem for U.S. manufacturers exposed to global trade. A stronger dollar and higher costs as a result of tariffs on some foreign goods are also weighing on some companies.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies, is up 7% from a year ago, meaning overseas sales equate to less earnings in dollar terms. And U.S. companies face higher prices for steel, aluminum and Chinese-made goods like engines and vinyl flooring that are now subject to tariffs.
Correct Craft Inc., a Florida-based boat manufacturer, is paying more for aluminum, and it is losing sales in Europe as a result of retaliatory tariffs placed on boats made in the U.S.
""It's been tough,"" Chief Executive Bill Yeargin said. ""We spend a lot of time thinking about recession planning.""

"Investors Warm to the Firms That Underpin China's E-Commerce Boom; Couriers play a pivotal role in e-commerce, which has revolutionized consumption in China","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2171565572?accountid=14586,"Shares in five of China's top six express-delivery companies have rebounded this year, supported by signs of resilient demand and attractive valuations.
Asia Market Snapshot:
* Regional stocks were mostly lower, led by a 0.6% fall in Japan's Nikkei 225.
* The Shanghai Composite dropped 0.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was flat.
* Iron-ore futures hit a 6-month high, after a deadly dam collapse in Brazil stoked concerns of supply disruption.
What's Happening
These couriers went public in 2016 and 2017. They play a pivotal role in e-commerce, which has revolutionized consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Online giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has backed ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc., Best Inc. and YTO Express Group Co., while rival JD.com Inc. operates its own in-house service.
Last year investors shunned the sector, fearing slowing business growth and cutthroat competition in a highly fragmented market. But this month, most firms have enjoyed a mini-recovery. New York-listed Best Inc. and Shanghai-listed YTO have risen the most, gaining 16.5%, while Yunda Holding Co., the smallest gainer, is up 6.9%.
S.F. Holding Co., China's largest listed courier company by market value, is down 5.5%. Its focus on more expensive premium delivery services faces stronger headwinds in a weakening economy .
After six years of breakneck growth, the courier business started slowing in 2017. The rate of increase in annual parcel volumes nearly halved to 28% that year and declined to 27% in 2018, according to research firm Bernstein. By value, growth is also decelerating.
Still, the recent figures are off a much larger base and remain several times higher than overall economic growth--showing e-commerce continues to grow in importance in China.
What It Means
Sentiment among investors began improving this month when figures showed parcel volume grew by 29% in December, the fastest rate since March.
""The data look encouraging,"" said Liu Yang, a Shanghai-based analyst at Hua Chuang Securities Co., who estimates full-year volume growth could be 20% to 25%. He said investors also believed steep selloffs last year for YTO and STO Express Co. made the stocks look like bargains. YTO trades at 16.5 times expected earnings, down from more than 24 times a year ago, Refinitiv data shows.
Cherry Leung, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bernstein, said that the firm's top pick is ZTO, which leads the industry with a 16.7% share of the market. ""A slowing economy would benefit mass-market players, especially cost leaders like ZTO,"" Ms. Leung said.
Ms. Leung said she expects the young and crowded industry to undergo consolidation in the long run, with about three big players dominating the market in the end. That too, should be good for the larger outfits.
""In developed markets like the U.S. and Japan, there aren't that many top players. The current industry structure in China is unsustainable,"" she said.

From Midwest to Far East: How China Affects America's Top Farm Export; China's soybean habits are changing--these charts show you how,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2171623670?accountid=14586,"China resumed buying soybeans from American farmers in December, after a monthslong hiatus caused by trade tensions. China is the world's largest consumer and importer of soybeans , but has become less dependent on the U.S. for the commodity, and its appetite for soybeans is now waning. These charts illustrate China's changing habits.
China also grows its own soybeans, which largely go into food products such as tofu. Imported soybeans, on the other hand, are mostly used to produce cooking oil and protein-rich soybean meal for feeding pigs, farmed fish and other livestock.
Soybeans are key to the U.S. farming industry, since they are by far the country's single biggest agricultural export.
Years of surpluses weakened the price of soybeans traded at the Chicago Board of Trade, before trade tensions further weighed on prices as China sought alternative supplies.
Brazil has overtaken the U.S. to become the largest supplier of soybeans to China, as well as the world's biggest exporter. Farmers in the South American nation have increased production to meet growing Chinese demand.
Before the trade conflict, as much as a quarter of U.S. soybean production went to China. The most recent U.S. census data shows that in the first 10 months of 2018, the U.S. exported just $3 billion worth of soybeans to China. That is a steep decline on previous years, although China typically has bought the bulk of its soybeans in the fourth quarter of the year.
China's soybean production is limited by the available arable land and the quality of seeds that domestic farmers use, according to industry analysts. Beijing also doesn't allow local farmers to grow genetically modified plants that tend to produce bigger harvests and are more disease-resistant.

Don't Shop for Alibaba as China Slows; The e-commerce giant will struggle to pick up speed as China's economy hits a rough patch,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2172689758?accountid=14586,"Alibaba just reported its slowest growth in years. China's worsening economy will make it difficult for the e-commerce giant to pick up steam again.
The company, based in China but listed in New York with a market capitalization of $403 billion, said revenue from its core retail-marketplace business grew 27% in the quarter through December compared with the same three months of 2017âthe slowest in three years. The unit, comprising the Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms, had a growth rate above 50% as recently as the quarter through September 2017.
Total sales for the company, up 41%, grew faster mainly because of revenue coming from acquisitions and new investments such as supermarkets and food delivery. However, these businesses are much less profitable , so Alibaba's operating profit in the quarter was only 3% higher than a year ago.
The slowdown isn't really a surprise, given that the company cut its revenue guidance in October for the fiscal year through March, blaming slower Chinese growth . The question for investors now is: Will 2019 be a better year?
Things to seem to be looking up. Private companies, many of which sell their goods on Alibaba's e-commerce platforms, have been struggling as Beijing's crackdown on shadow banking has starved them of financing. The trade conflict with the U.S. has likely further dampened sentiment. These problems may start to hit the job market as well as consumption. And unlike Amazon's marketplace business, which takes a cut of transactions, Taobao makes its money by charging merchants to advertise, which may prove more vulnerable in a downturn.
Alibaba's shares have dropped 25% from their peak in June, but still trade for 27 times forward earnings, only slightly below the three-year average of 28. Given that China's macroeconomic outlook still looks pretty uncertain, investors should wait before jumping back in.

The Caixin China services purchasing managers' index slipped to 53.6 in January from 53.9 in December, Caixin Media Co. and research firm Markit said.
A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity from the previous month while a level below that points to a contraction.
""Demand for services remained solid as the increase in new business accelerated marginally,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a statement accompanying the data.
But the sub-index of business expectations declined from the previous month, indicating services providers' weakening confidence in the outlook of their operation for the coming 12 months, Mr. Zhong said.
""Given that the government has refrained from taking policies of strong stimulus, the downward trend of the economy may be hard to turn around for the time being,"" he said.

"How China's SOEs Squeeze Private Firms; China's state-owned companies are critical tools for Communist Party control, but their predatory behavior is becoming a major economic problem","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2176642764?accountid=14586,"Predators are supposed to be lean, fast and prey on the weak. When they are fat, slow and dine on the strong, your ecosystemâor economyâhas a serious problem.
The predatory behavior of China's inefficient state-owned enterprises is a concern for both policy makers there and U.S. trade negotiators. Clipping SOEs' wings would benefit both economies. But President Xi Jinping seems unconvinced that deep-seated, market-friendly reforms are necessary. The harm that is doing to China's private sectorâwhat economists term 'crowding out'â is only becoming clearer .
One reason Chinese companies often flout global norms is that the rules at home make life hard for private firms . Cutting regulatory corners, often with the blessing of local officials, is sometimes necessary to survive. That's why Beijing's recentralization of power under committed statist Mr. Xi has been so damaging to private enterprise: space for local ""experimentation,"" particularly finding ways to work around the calcified state banking system, has disappeared.
State-backed companies' advantages aren't limited to bank finance. Their dominant market position helps them squeeze private sector suppliers by refusing to make timely payments for goods. The problem tends to worsen when overall industrial SOE profit growth slowsâlike now. Rising payables at SOEs could effectively extract an additional 1 trillion yuan ($148 billion) from private companies in 2019, estimates Thomas Gatley, a senior analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. That's equivalent to about three times their total corporate bond and medium-term note issuance last year.
Private companies getting squeezed on both funding and revenue was probably a major factor driving the 2018 spike in borrowing using shares in private companies as collateral last year. More than 1,000 non-SOE listed firms now have controlling shareholders who have pledged more than 50% of their stock for loans: Collectively, they recorded a big rise in receivables in the past three years. In turn, their financial weakness has created juicy targets for cash-rich SOEs, which gobbled up more than $6.2 billion of private companies' equity in 2018.
Top officials recognize the danger: Premier Li Keqiang has called for SOEs to pay back arrears promptly or risk ""blacklisting"", while recent central bank moves have been aimed at boosting small-business lending. This could prove too little, too late to avoid a sharp slowdown âmeaning Beijing may eventually have to dilute the current shadow banking crackdown that has so disadvantaged private companies. Failing that, it may be forced into another so-called flood-type stimulus, as seen in 2009 and 2015.
Meanwhile, don't envy U.S. negotiators pushing for deep changes in China's economic model. As in the World Trade Organization accessions talks of the 1990s, they might find some unexpected reformist Chinese allies. But SOEs are past masters of tilting the playing fieldâand Mr. Xi still appears to have their backs.

China Trade Tensions Hit Stocks --- Blue chips' 220.77 point fall is steepest in two weeks after new U.S.-China warning,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2177058979?accountid=14586,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points Thursday, its steepest loss in two weeks, as trade tensions and bleak economic data from Europe renewed fears of a slowdown in global growth.
Investors have grappled with conflicting signals about the durability of the global economic expansion this year, something that has kept enthusiasm for risk taking contained even after markets rallied in January.
Major U.S. indexes opened lower, tracking declines in Europe, and extended their slump after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said China and the U.S. are still far away from striking a trade deal. A White House official later said President Trump is ""highly unlikely"" to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the March 1 expiration of their tariff truce.
Trade-sensitive stocks, including machinery giant Caterpillar, chip maker Intel and aerospace company Boeing, each shed about 1%. Those losses weighed on the Dow industrials, which slid 220.77 points, or 0.9%, to 25169.53, their biggest point and percentage drop since Jan. 22. The S&P 500 lost 25.56 points, or 0.9%, to 2706.05, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 86.93 points, or 1.2%, to 7288.35.
""It's not unusual for the market to take a pause after such a rapid run,"" said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust. ""One of our concerns was that the market was running too fast, too hard.""
Hopes that the U.S. and China would be able to carve out a trade deal, along with signals the Federal Reserve will pause its campaign to raise interest rates, had helped stocks rebound in recent weeks. After a bruising December selloff, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 notched their best January in 30 years and their biggest monthly gains since October 2015.
Yet some investors say there is plenty of reason for caution. Investors have been monitoring companies' growth outlooks for signs of a slowdown in corporate profits.
Companies in the S&P 500 are on track to report a 1.9% decline in profits for the first quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That would mark their first year-over-year profit decline since the second quarter of 2016 and a marked deterioration from September when earnings for the period were projected to grow by about 7%.
""It's going to be rocky heading into March because there's a lot of uncertainty,"" said Mark Esposito, founder and chief executive of Esposito Securities, referring to the trade deadline. ""I'm more concerned about corporate earnings going forward not being robust, and that causing the market to fall.""
Meanwhile, data have pointed to growing weakness in China and the eurozone, raising the threat of regional economic malaise spreading around the world. Reports Thursday showed industrial production unexpectedly fell in Germany and Spain in December, and the European Commission cut its forecast for eurozone growth in 2019.
Investors remain in the dark on several potential flashpoints in global politics that they say could damp growth.
In the U.K., lawmakers have yet to reach a consensus for how the country should proceed before its scheduled departure in March from the European Union.
The ""economy is suffering under the strain of Brexit and talks of extending the uncertainty,"" said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. That has muddied the picture for officials at the Bank of England, which on Thursday held interest rates steady and cut its outlook for economic growth.
The British pound strengthened 0.2% against the dollar, while the Stoxx Europe 600 declined 1.5%.
Elsewhere, stocks in Asia were mixed, but with exchanges in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, trading volumes were muted on Thursday. In early trading in Asia Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.84%. At midday, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was off 1.63%.

"'Investors are ignoring China - but not for long': Â  Dale Nicholls, of Fidelity China Special Situations, still sees huge potential in China's middle-class miracle, he tells Sam Meadows",The Daily Telegraph; London (UK),2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2177525185?accountid=14586,"The Chinese year of the dog certainly lived up to its name as markets around the world slumped, hurting investors.
China was no different and investors focused on the far-eastern powerhouse will hope the year of the pig proves more fruitful. Dale Nicholls is the manager of Fidelity China Special Situations, one of Britain's largest Chinese-focused investment trusts with Â£1.6bn of assets.
Mr Nicholls told Telegraph Money why investors should ignore Donald Trump, traffic jams could be about to get worse in Shanghai and China's economy is a safe bet despite the recent scandals.
What does the trust aim to do? Our aim is simply to find the best ideas and deliver the best performance for investors depending on what's out there on the market. We don't have any specific targets. It's obviously a very volatile market but there's a lot of opportunity.
What's so attractive about China? China is going through a lot of structural change. Geopolitical concerns play a role and there are high debt levels, but there is still a huge opportunity around the development of its middle class.
When you invest in China you are also thinking about policy. The Government is trying to rebalance the Chinese economy, shifting from debt-based investment towards more balanced growth.
That is reflected in policies that will support the consumer and develop the middle class.
Has Donald Trump's presidency changed things for China? It's obviously impacted markets, and it affects businesses in terms of the way they look to grow, because it's not clear the way things are going to go.
The majority of my portfolio is focused on the domestic opportunity and 90pc of the revenues are focused on China, so my companies won't be directly impacted by any higher tariffs.
But on the ground in China it has impacted confidence, you do feel that.
Why does the trust have such a heavy weighting to Hong Kong? Traditionally, the majority of investable opportunities have been in Hong Kong: it's one of the interesting stories around investing in China.
China is on its way to being the biggest country in the world in terms of GDP, but typically it has made up less than 3pc of world markets. That has started to grow and I think it will drive the biggest shift in global stocks we will see in the next decade.
A lot of investors have been able to ignore China in the past. That is going to become more difficult.
Two companies make up 27pc of your portfolio. Is that risky? It's invested in two companies but two really good companies. Tencent is a very strong gaming business. It's had some short-term issues from a ban on new approvals, which is now easing. It is the clear leader in the sector, for which there is a lot of demand.
Tencent also created WeChat - the Facebook of China. It has over a billion users. If you're doing anything in China, it is completely entrenched. Unlike Facebook, there is potential to grow its advertising business.
Alibaba is an online retailer that is moving into other areas, such as offline sales and logistics. There is a lot of potential for growth.
Has the Huawei crisis damaged trust in the Chinese market? No, I don't think so. Foreign investors are more concerned by trade rhetoric and slowing economic growth.
Last year, China's GDP grew by 6.6pc - still an enviable rate of growth in a global context - and consumption continues to grow faster, supported by an expanding middle class.
What's been your best investment? One of the best has been China MeiDong Auto, a car dealer focused mostly in the south of China. It has a very strong management team and also has a good way of making acquisitions, which has helped it during downturns in business.
There is huge potential in the car industry in China. Consider car ownership per 1,000 people. In China, that number is 160, whereas most western countries are at a level three or four times that. It's not necessarily going to go that high, but there's a lot of room for growth.
And your worst? One that has been hurt by the stock market is Hutchison China MediTech. It's a traditional Chinese medicine business, but it has a strong research and drug development portfolio.
One of its drugs didn't pass its trial and the stock price fell by more than 40pc. That is only one of a number of drugs in development, so I think the price drop is unjustified. Clearly, in 2018 it's been a disappointment.
How are you paid? And do you have your own money in the fund? There's a salary, but it's mostly tied up in the performance of the fund. I have a significant amount of my own money invested.
What would you be if you weren't a fund manager? Starting a business always appealed. As a shareholder in the trust, I feel like I'm playing my part. I was a pretty good footballer when I was younger. I made a few bucks playing at college but it didn't go further than that.

But unlike Amazon, Alibaba's core business is as an online shopping centre where merchants and small businesses sell their products directly to China and the world.
The cash generated by that side of the business is allowing Alibaba to including cloud computing.
Data traffic has ballooned in China over the past few years, well beyond America, and continues to do Cloud computing isn't a huge profit driver yet, but it has really strong growth potential.

China's Muted Inflation Likely to Spur Policy Easing; Weak economic readings could encourage People's Bank of China to stimulate economic growth,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2180451355?accountid=14586,"BEIJINGâInflation moderated across the board in China last month in another sign of lethargic domestic demandâone that economists said gives the central bank more room to stimulate economic growth.
Inflation eased for both producer prices, which crept closer to deflation, and for consumer prices, which hit a one-year low, according to official statistics released Friday.
The producer-price index, a gauge of prices at the factory gate, edged up 0.1% in January, slowing from a 0.9% gain in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The consumer-price index rose 1.7% in January from a year earlier, compared with a 1.9% increase in December , the bureau said.
January's muted inflation is the latest indication that the slowdown in the Chinese economy that became evident in the middle of last year is persisting into the new. Some economists said the inflation data should provide impetus to the People's Bank of China to cut interest rates or take other measures to stimulate growth.
The latest data show ""that price levels are overall pretty low and reflect sluggish domestic demand. Any inflation risk, at this point, shouldn't be a concern now,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an economist at Bank of Communications.
A particular concern for policy makers are producer prices, which during the last downturn stayed stubbornly deflationary, making it more difficult for companies to generate profits. January's 0.1% rise in producer inflation was the seventh straight month of deceleration and was the slowest increase since September 2016.
Though prices of raw materials and unfinished products edged down 0.1% last month, finished products climbed 0.6%, slowing a tick from December's 0.7% growth, said Dong Yaxiu, an analyst with the statistics bureau, in a statement.
Mr. Liu is one among many economists forecasting that the producer-price index will turn negative in the second quarter.
As the economy has slowed , the central bank has been tapping various credit facilities to make sure there is ready money on hand for investment, though companies have been reluctant borrowers. The bank hasn't cut benchmark interest ratesâa potentially bigger shot of stimulusâover the past year, in part out of concern that expected rate increases from the U.S. Federal Reserve would then entice investors to take money out of China.
Now that the Fed is easing off, the central bank is expected to further cut rates for its lending facilities and if conditions worsen might be more willing to cut benchmark rates, some economists said, though they differ on the timing and extent of such a move.
Citi economists expect a cut in rates for the standing lending facility as early as this month, partly due to looming producer-price deflation risks. Lin Shu, an economist at China Merchants Securities, expects such cuts could come around midyear when the producer-price index may fall 2%-3% from a year earlier.

Why Some Investors Are Skeptical About China's Search Giant; China's Baidu keeps losing ground to bigger rivals Alibaba and Tencent,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2184334716?accountid=14586,"China's Baidu has lost more ground to its bigger online rivals Alibaba and Tencent, as measured in market-value terms, as competition grows and China's economy slows.
Asia Markets Snapshot
* China's stock markets led gains with the Shanghai Composite up 1.9%; Shenzhen's ChiNext Price Index rallied 3.1%.
* Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.7% and indexes in South Korea and Australia were also up.
* China fixed the yuan at 6.7151 to the dollar, its strongest in three weeks.
What's Happening
Baidu Inc., the operator of China's largest search engine, reported after close of trading Thursday in New York 22% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. While that was stronger than expected, net profit halved to 2.08 billion yuan ($303 million). Baidu's shares jumped 3.8% in aftermarket trading.
The earnings were affected by higher costs amid fierce competition and increased spending at separately listed video-streaming service unit iQiyi. On the same day, iQiyi reported a wider quarterly loss, as it continued to invest in original content.
Over the years, Baidu has been considered one of China's ""BAT""âa trinity grouping it with e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and social-media and gaming specialist Tencent Holdings Ltd.
However, its full-year profit was just roughly a third of its bigger peers. A market value of about $60.0 billion was about 14% of Alibaba's as of Thursday, down from more than 30% a few years ago. Baidu's shares have rebounded less than its biggest rivals in 2019.
What It Means
Investors have many other ways to bet on China's internet, said Vincent Wen, an investment manager at KCG Securities Asia. ""The company has passed its heyday and it's hard for it to play catch up,"" he said. Mr. Wen said investments in driverless cars would take time to bear fruit, and other initiatives would add to costs.
The company's stock trades at a price of about 16 times forecast earnings, below Tencent's 29 times and Alibaba's 26 times, data compiled by Refinitiv shows. That reflects investor perceptions that Baidu has low growth potential, said Mr. Wen.
Baidu's heavy reliance on advertising also makes it vulnerable in the economic slowdown in China, said Dennis Guan, a senior analyst at hedge fund eFusion Capital. ""Marketing spending is always among the first to be cut by corporations as the economy slows,"" he said.
Mr. Guan said Baidu had also been hit as Chinese consumers shift to browsing on smartphones rather than desktops, while its newsfeed service faces threats from competitors including Beijing-based Bytedance Ltd.
Others are more positive. U.S. fund manager Artisan Partners lifted its stake more than 13% in the fourth quarter, to more than 7 million shares, filings show. In an earlier update to investors, one of the group's funds said it was attracted to ""Baidu's high profitability and net cash position"" and expects it to grow as online search takes a bigger slice of Chinese advertising spending.

China Data Weigh on Emerging-Market Currencies; Dollar rises against emerging-market currencies after data showed a slowdown in China's factory activity,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2186793104?accountid=14586,"Emerging-market currencies fell against the dollar Thursday, after data showed a slowdown in China's manufacturing sector deepened in February.
The dollar was up 0.6% against the Brazilian real and gained 1.1% against the South African rand while rising against a broad range of other emerging-market currencies.
Activity in China's manufacturing sector slipped to its lowest level in three years in February, weighed down by weak global demand and the long Lunar New Year holiday, official data showed Thursday. China, the world's second largest economy, is a key destination for commodities and other products exported by many developing countries.
Some investors are betting that China's efforts to boost growth may bear fruit in coming months. Since last year, Beijing has tried to spur investment by accelerating bond issuance and pumping funds into its banking system.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was up 0.2% at 89.52.

China Hits Off Switch on Laser Stock Beloved by Foreigners; China bars foreigners from buying more shares in Han's Laser,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2188164872?accountid=14586,"China has barred foreigners from buying more shares in a Shenzhen-listed laser specialist, after global investors got close to breaching the country's 30% cap on international ownership for any single stock.
The halt comes days after MSCI Inc., the index compiler, moved to add more companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen to its influential benchmarks, giving shares from these two markets more weight in those gauges.
Many nations limit foreign holdings in select industries, but broad restrictions are much rarer, though MSCI research shows they apply in several markets in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia.
Offshore investors had built their holdings in Han's Laser Technology Industry Group Co. to above 20% from just 7% a year ago via stock connect, a trading link with Hong Kong. Including shares held via the separate Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor program and a second similar program, foreign holdings have hit 28.2%, the company said Tuesday.
Shenzhen's stock exchange has now told its Hong Kong counterpart to halt purchase orders, Han's Laser said, until foreign ownership falls below 26%. Sell orders can still proceed.
""It's a concern to offshore investors"", said Jack Lee, chief investment officer at Schroder Investment Management (Shanghai) Co. He said as more foreign funds flow into Chinese markets, such cases would become more common.
Mr. Lee said international fund managers were worried they might be unable to buy stocks they liked. Such restrictions could also make it harder for index trackers to match benchmarks precisely, he said.
Beijing caps foreign shareholdings for onshore stocks at 30% in total, and 10% for any single shareholder. Chinese stocks are growing in importance to global investors, but outsiders face other constraints in betting on Chinese markets, including trading suspensions and a lack of ways to hedge their risks through futures and options.
Shares in Han's Laser have leapt 47% this year, giving it a market value of around $7 billion. Its customers include Apple Inc., Sony Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co.
Steven Yang, head of China A-and H-share strategy and products at CLSA, said Han's Laser was a favorite pick for investors seeking to profit from China's economic transition, and looking for Chinese companies unlike those listed abroad in Hong Kong or New York.
In 2015, foreigners were blocked from buying into state-owned airport operator Shanghai International Airport Co., after offshore holdings topped 28%. Overall, foreigners held just 2.6% of the onshore, or A-share, stock market by value at the end of 2018, HSBC analysis shows.

China's Amazing Collapsing Exports; The timing of the new year holiday had a big impact on China's February trade data. The broader picture still isn't very encouraging.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2188847791?accountid=14586,"This time of year, the Chinese economy resembles a poorly kept barnyard. Dogs, pigs and even dragons run roughshod over the data.
China's apparently frightening drop in exports in Februaryâdown 20.7% on the yearâis a classic example. Western countries follow the Gregorian calendar, but China's most important holiday follows the lunar calendar. In turn, the shifting weeklong Lunar New Year holiday makes year-over-year comparisons of economic data in January, February and sometimes even March tricky.
In 2018, the Year of the Dog, the holiday fell on Feb. 16, the second-latest Lunar New Year in the past decade. That meant more of the distortion in early-year trade data was pushed into March: February exports in 2018 rose 44.5% from a year earlier, but March exports fell 2.7%. This year, the holiday came on Feb. 5, meaning most of the impact was in January and February. That huge base effect from last February largely explains the stomach-wrenching drop this year.
None of this is to say Chinese exports are doing well, it's just the magnitude of the drop that is off. The combined January and February data give a more-accurate picture. Exports in the first two months of 2019 were 4.6% lower than a year earlier, similar to December's pace of 4.4%.
Weakening growth in Europe is one factor: January-February exports in yuan terms were up 7.5% on the year, significantly slower than double-digit growth rates in mid-2018. But the trade conflict with the U.S. is now really starting to bite . January-February exports to the U.S. fell 9.9% in yuan terms. Exports to Southeast Asia, however, rose 7%âimplying some rearrangement of supply chains to avoid U.S. tariffs , suggests ANZ. Chinese stocks opened down sharply lower following dreary news overnight from Europe, and dropped further after the trade data released midmorning.
The overall picture is of China starting to feel real heat from U.S. trade pressureâbut not in utter collapse as the headline figure implies. Still, things will likely get worse before they get better: China's manufacturing purchasing managers index still shows new export orders trending down.
In 2018, Chinese exports proved resilient. The real dog days, unfortunately, are still ahead.

"Why China Moved First on Boeing; On track to become the world's biggest aviation superpower, China is flexing its muscle as an arbiter of safety","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2191385736?accountid=14586,"Beijing
When China grounded 96 Boeing planes on Mondayâtwo days before U.S. regulators did the same âit was doing more than responding to a pair of fatal airline crashes. It was also asserting its growing clout as an aviation superpower.
China is forecast to dethrone the U.S. as the world's biggest aviation market by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. That's made China a vital customer for plane makers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE, and turned the country's airlines into some of the of biggest in the world in terms of passengers flown and routes served. That growth has also given the country increased leverage over the two big jet makersâand a new level of influence in the global aviation industry.
China's unilateral decision Monday, following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX a day earlier, idled more than a quarter of Boeing's active 737 MAX fleet, used by 13 airlines. The move stunned some experts, who said it was premature without knowing the cause of the Ethiopian crash. In the past, China's airspace regulator, run by Communist Party officials, has registered barely a blip on the international radar; it has routinely followed guidance from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Its decision Monday made a clear statement to the world that it was flexing its muscles.
After China acted, Singapore, one of Asia's most respected regulators, followed. Over the next two days, dozens of countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America did the same . By Wednesday, the FAA in the U.S. confirmed that it, too, was grounding the MAX.
""They had difficulty making a decision,"" said Li Jian, the deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, explaining to reporters in Beijing on Monday why his agency had moved before the FAA. The Ethiopian Airlines crash was the second deadly accident involving a 737 MAX 8 in five months. The agency said the two crashes were similar enough to merit the decision to ground the aircraft. Boeing declined to comment on China's surprise move.
That decisiveness, which coincided with a top leadership meeting in Beijing held against the backdrop of U.S.-China trade talks, may have owed more to the country's murky domestic politics than aviation safety, some analysts say. After a series of plane crashes in the 1990s China significantly improved its aviation safety record, and the nation's communist rulers have since exercised extreme caution to reassure its population that they are vigilant, acting fast in the face of any perceived risk.
The Chinese authorities' readiness to defy international convention and ground the MAX while the cause of the crash was still unknown also showed that China now has the self-confidence to challenge aviation's established order, said Geoffrey Thomas, chief editor of Airline Ratings.
That confidence will only grow as China's middle class opens up air travel to tens of millions of people here. In 2000, 62 million flights were taken by passengers in China, a 10th of the U.S. total; in 2017 that rose to 551 million, two-thirds that in the U.S., according to the International Civil Aviation Organization. By 2037 China will account for 1.6 billion passengers a year, compared with the U.S.'s 1.3 billion, IATA forecasts.
That accelerating growth has meant an ongoing bonanza for Boeing and Airbus: Boeing delivered 1,000 jets to China over the last five years, having taken 40 years to deliver the previous 1,000. Boeing opened its first overseas facility, which paints and fits the interiors of MAX jets, in China in December. It plans to deliver 100 jets per year from the facility.
Boeing expects China to buy 7,690 jetliners worth $1.19 trillion over the next two decades, accounting for nearly a quarter of global demand. It says 5,730 of those will be single-aisle jets like the 737 MAX, of which Chinese airlines have so far ordered 574.
Now, Chinese aviation officials say the MAX won't be allowed to fly in China again until they're convinced of its safety. Boeing announced Thursday that it was pausing deliveries of the model.

China is also at work on a homegrown jetliner expected to enter into service in the next few years. The C919 could help China's government achieve its long-term aim of ending its dependency on the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, though analysts say it is unclear whether the C919 will have the fuel efficiency needed to compete head-on with models like the 737 and Airbus.
China's big three state-run airlinesâAir China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlinesâand their many subsidiaries, together with Hainan Airlines, which is owned by HNA Group Co., are ready customers for any working jetliner the country manages to produce. Still rapidly expanding, they have already become dominant players on many key global routes, including lucrative transpacific flights.
Chinese airlines have operated more flights between the U.S. and China than American carriers since 2015, and they're extending their lead. This year the Chinese airlines are offering 943 flights per month between the two countries, compared with 582 by the U.S. carriers, according to aviation data company OAG.
Currently, a massive new airport, its roof resembling a giant copper-covered snowflake, is taking shape on Beijing's southern outskirts. Called Daxing, the airport, expected to open to passengers in September, is designed to eventually handle 100 million passengers and close to 1 million flights a year. The $60 billion hub will be Beijing's second major airport; the existing airport, Beijing Capital, is already the world's second busiest after Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson.
""We could put the whole Bird's Nest Stadium in here,"" said Li Jianhua, the project manager, proudly showing off the airport's cavernous terminal to reporters in early March, referring to the iconic sports stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
The new airport is urgently needed, with Beijing Capital already bursting at the seams. It rejects 400 takeoff-and-landing applications every day because there's no room for more planes, said Yi Wei, a project vice-manager at Daxing.
Daxing is just one link in a huge network that's taking shape in China: The aviation authority says the country will have 450 civil airports by 2035, up from 235 today; and 2,000 general-aviation airports by 2030, up from just 80 last year, enabling a boom in private and business aviation.
As China gains dominance in global air travel, the FAA and other aviation safety agencies may find that this week won't be the last time they have to follow China's lead.

"Italy Signs Up to China's Global Infrastructure Plan Despite U.S. Ire; U.S. diplomats and EU officials have criticized Italy's move, warning that China's plans could weaken Western cohesion","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2195906773?accountid=14586,"ROMEâItaly and China signed an agreement to cooperate on Beijing's global infrastructure plan, the Belt and Road Initiative, sealing an accord that has alarmed Italy's U.S. and European allies .
Chinese President Xi Jinping, on a six-day visit to Europe, and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte presided over the signing ceremony in Rome. Italy's support for the Belt and Road Initiative is a diplomatic victory for Mr. Xi, whose ambitious plan for an international network of ports, roads, railways and pipelines has faced criticism for the opacity of some deals.
Italy is the first member of the Group of Seven major advanced economies to sign up to the initiative. Many Western governments see the plan as a Chinese push for geopolitical influence, not just for business. Italy has in recent weeks sought to reassure the U.S. and European Union that its agreement with Beijing isn't legally binding and doesn't weaken Italy's commitment to its Western political and security alliances.
U.S. diplomats and EU officials have criticized Italy's move, warning that China's plans could increase its influence over other countries and weaken Western cohesion.

""We remain an ally of the U.S. and NATO, but when it's a question of commercial relations [signing accords] is what interests me,"" Luigi Di Maio, a deputy prime minister and leader of the largest party in the governing coalition, said following the signing ceremony.
Mr. Xi's visit comes as EU leaders are debating how to respond to China's fast-rising global power. The EU, which wants to defend an international order based on rules and reciprocity, fears coming under pressure from China to accept its investments, and from the U.S. to keep them at bay. In particular, the bid by Huawei Technologies Co. to supply Europe with 5G mobile-internet equipment has sparked security fears in Washington, which has urged its allies to exclude the Chinese company from sensitive infrastructure.
In the coming days, Mr. Xi is set to visit Monaco and the French Riviera, before heading to Paris for talks about the wider relationship between China and Europe with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
The three European leaders are expected to brief Mr. Xi about the EU's shifting approach to China, including European demands for greater reciprocity on economic access for trade and investment.
Italy's bilateral embrace of China's prestige project has irritated many of its EU partners when the bloc is looking for a more robust collective stance toward Beijing. Italian officials have stressed that Saturday's agreement, and a number of associated business deals, don't cover any award of 5G contracts to China.
The business deals between the two countries that have accompanied Mr. Xi's trip have been in sectors ranging from energy and transport to industry and finance. Italian kitchen maker Snaidero said it agreed on a joint venture with Hi-Season Trading Co. Ltd. to distribute its products in China, while Italian bank UBI Banca SpA announced a collaboration agreement with Chinese machinery importer Sumec International Technology.
The accords signed Saturday are worth â¬2.5 billion ($2.8 billion) and the two countries are working toward finalizing other agreements next month when Mr. Conte visits in China, Mr. Di Maio said.

Did he and the Democrats in Congress make any progress?"" The answer is yes, though the project remained slightly incomplete at the time of President Trump's election. A coalition was formed in this regard, and a consensus was arrived at, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a comprehensive, multilateral trade agreement among all the major trading nations along the Pacific Rim with the exclusion of China; this rankled the Chinese leadership and they attempted to counter with a rare multilateral trade agreement of their own.
While it is difficult to defend most of the legislation, executive orders and pseudo-treaties (Iran nuclear, Paris climate) that were promulgated under President Obama, the passage of TPP would have hamstrung, to some degree, many of China's larger ambitions that are now in the works: Belt and Road Initiative, Made in China 2025, possibly some of the expansion in the South China Sea, their own trade negotiations with the nations that were part of TPP, etc.
President Trump honored his campaign promise to deep-six America's participation in the TPP but he received nothing from China for doing so unilaterally. It was the biggest chit for the art of dealing for the protection of intellectual property, the control of fentanyl exports, the tamping down of cyber espionage and other diplomatic, political and economic concerns much larger than the fluctuating price of soybeans. When we received nothing for it, the champagne corks popped in the Chinese Politboro and America's trade negotiators were left in a weaker position.

Time Travel in China; Where to find vestiges of old-world Chinaâincluding an entire traditional village that's been restored as a luxury hotel,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2198047770?accountid=14586,"WHILE MOST of China hurtles toward the future, replacing small villages with megacities chock-full of high-rises, a few pockets of the nation have managed to preserve their past by turning to unlikely collaborators: tourists and hoteliers. In places such as Shaxi, a lush valley high in the mountains of Yunnan Province, visitors hungry to see the storybook version of ancient China are helping to spur a flurry of private and public preservation initiatives.

50 Origin Stories Behind Everything From eBay to the Spork
Not too long ago, Sideng Old Town, a historic trading center in the middle of the valley, was a little-visited farming town full of ancient buildings, most too unstable to live or work in. Today, these ornate stone and pressed-earth structures have been restored meticulously, and it's not uncommon to find tourists in trekking gear wandering through the central square admiring the town's 15th-century temple and the 18th-century theater. A number of coffee shops and other small family businesses have taken over traditional homes that still sport elaborate tile roofs and blue frescoes on the outer walls, typical decorations of the local Bai minority people.
""There's a [recent] push at the national level to promote authentic local culture,"" said Chris Barclay, an American expat who runs Shaxi's Old Theater Inn, a guesthouse next to an 18th-century theater near Sideng, and also restored an old temple and nunnery in a neighboring village. Last year, the ministries of tourism and culture merged into one entity, emphasizing that in today's China, tourism and cultural preservation are inextricably intertwined. In Shaxi, nonprofits and villagers led the effort to restore the town to help attract more visitors. Other sites around China were saved from the wrecking ball by luxury hotels. Here are a few other spots where tourism is lending new purpose to old relics.
Heshun
As a major gateway on the Southern Silk Road, the small town of Heshun was once home to wealthy merchants and European customs houses. Thirty miles from the border with Myanmar, the town was largely forgotten after trade stopped in World War II. Around 2000, the local government began preserving these elaborate Ming and Qing Dynasty buildings, stabilizing the pressed-earth structures and replacing aging wood walls and carved screens. Over time Heshun evolved into a tourist town with small inns, restaurants and a museum, all housed in these old structures. The area is largely unknown to Westerners, but tour companies such Wild China offer customized trips ( wildchina.com ).
Beijing
Up until the early 20th century, hutongsânarrow lanes lined with low-slung courtyard housesâwere standard across the city. These days, most hutongs have been replaced with shiny skyscrapers, but in some neighborhoods, like Shichahai or Dongcheng, the old homes now host trendy restaurants and shops. Visitors can browse limited-edition furniture at the Lost and Found (42 Guozijian Dajie), learn to appreciate the musty-smelling baijiu (a local liquor) at Capital Spirits (16 Xinsi Hutong) or enjoy a farm-to-table meal at Private Kitchen 44 (70 Deshengmen Inner St).
West Lake
Near the city of Hangzhou in East China, West Lake is one of the country's most bucolic spots, surrounded by forested mountains, tea fields and pagodas. The Amanfayun resort, set in the mountains a few miles from the lake, took over a small village in 2010, turning the old wooden homes with tiled roofs into guest quarters, three restaurants and a spa. One of the 18th-century bungalows now hosts a cigar bar and library; it's also the place where the resort's resident calligrapher offers guests a few pointers (from $700 a night, aman.com )
Shanghai
When a local philanthropist, Ma Dadong, discovered that a new reservoir in his native Fuzhou, 400 miles from Shanghai, would destroy dozens of ancient Ming and Qing Dynasty homes, he worked with Aman properties to transport 10,000 camphor trees and 50 of the ornate brick-and-stone dwellings to a property near Shanghai, which opened last year as Amanyangyun (from $740 a night, aman.com ). At the two-year-old Capella Shanghai, Jian Ye Li hotel, guests can bunk down in one of the restored shikumen houses popular among the French expat crowd from the 1870s until World War II. These three-story courtyard houses that combine European and Chinese design are among the best preserved in the city and are filled with shops, museums and restaurants, as well as Capella's luxury villas (from $550 a night, capellahotels.com ).

Wilhelmine Germany Is a Better Analogy for China; The closest 19th-century parallel to modern China isn't America but Imperial Germany.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2198125018?accountid=14586,"Regarding Katherine E. Epstein's "" To Understand China, Look to America's History "" (op-ed, March 20): The closest 19th-century parallel to modern China isn't America but Imperial Germany.

Both pursued parity with the era's dominant naval power even though, as Winston Churchill warned, this was an entirely unnecessary ""luxury"" for land-based powers. Both made massive infrastructure projects, designed to tie Europe and Asia, a centerpiece of their diplomacy. Wilhelmine Germany built a Berlin-Baghdad railway, China pursues its Belt and Road Initiative today. Both created crises around attempts to seize overseas facilities: Agadir in 1911, and artificial South China Sea islands today.
Germany's aggressiveness eventually drew Europe into World War I. No doubt the catastrophe could have been avoidedâWinston Churchill called Western leaders' reactions to the unfolding crisis ""cataleptic.""

"Airbnb Wants the Key to China's Millennial Empire; Global companies are fighting for a piece of China's home-share market, but they have got competition","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2198532926?accountid=14586,"Airbnb wants to accommodate China's millennials, but it may need a local tour guide.
There are more Chinese born between 1981 and 1996 than people of all ages in the U.S. and 70% of them already own homes. That makes Chinese millennials especially attractive for home sharing, and global companies are flocking to the scene. But while most are relying on local market leaders to pave the way, others like Airbnb are taking a more solitary tack.
Despite the huge opportunity, home sharing is still rather nascent in China, accounting for just 5% of the $93 billion Chinese lodging scene, according to Euromonitor. This compares with a U.S. market penetration of nearly 10%, according to Statista.
Profits haven't come easily for foreign players. Language barriers, cultural differences and local regulations have deterred many foreign companies, leading some to sell out or invest in local competitors instead. Expedia sold its stake in underperforming Chinese competitor eLong to Chinese online-travel market leader Ctrip.com. Global market leader Booking Holdings, Inc. owns Singapore-based online-travel giant Agoda, but also has a significant stake in Ctrip, among other local investments.
Airbnb has a different game plan. After backing out of a deal with Chinese home-sharing leader Tujia in 2017, it has built its own team of roughly 300 local employees. Last year the company appointed a local president in seasoned entrepreneur Tao Peng and Airbnb co-founder Nate Blecharczyk is personally leading the charge as chairman of the China operation.
The company says it is making progress , but it has a long road ahead. While Airbnb's breadth of international listings are a distinct competitive advantage, domestic listings now account for more than half of its Chinese business, according to Mr. Blecharczyk. In China, at least, the company is taking a hands-on approach with local authoritiesâ unlike its strategy in other countries , where it reportedly has skirted zoning and other regulations. But despite heavy investment, Airbnb has so far won just 7% of the Chinese home-share market, according to Euromonitor. Local competitors are formidable ; the two largest combined own nearly half of the market.
What's Next for Markets?
Register for a Wall Street Journal conference call on markets Friday with Heard on the Street's Spencer Jakab and Justin Lahart.
Airbnb does have the advantage of being a millennial favorite, though. To date, millennials comprise 58% of Airbnb's global business and 69% of Airbnb's customers in China are millennials, according to the company. Chinese millennials represent 25% of the 1.4 billion Chinese population and they like to travel. Millennials spent 36% of their income on travel last year compared with 28% by the broader Chinese population, according to Ipsos. And younger millennials spent 80% more on international travel from May 2017 to May 2018 than the year prior.
To fund their travel, they list their greatest assets for rent: their homes. Roughly 90% of all Chinese citizens own a home, versus 65% of Americans. Further, a national building boom, combined with soaring real-estate prices, has left more than one-fifth of China's homes vacant, according to the Emerging Advisors Group, a large percentage of which are ripe for investment income.
But despite the enormous opportunity, it is unclear whether any foreign company can dominate China's home-sharing market. Political conditions continue to be challenging at best; passport numbers and guest whereabouts must be reported to authorities, and players must pay heavy taxes and even court government officials to gain local goodwill.
Booking, which said 20% of its global business was alternative accommodations in 2018, at least has deep pockets to invest in more growth there. It also has the benefit of sizable local partners. Airbnb seems determined to fly solo where few U.S. companies have successfully navigated. But to woo China's 400 million millennials, they may need a lot more local flavor.

Stocks Rise as China Data Ease Concerns Over Global Growth; Better manufacturing data out of China helps stock markets kick off new quarter with gains,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2200594760?accountid=14586,"U.S. stocks and bond yields ripped higher Monday after upbeat Chinese manufacturing data offered investors a sign that the world's second-largest economy was possibly stabilizing.
Stocks world-wide kicked off the second quarter with gains after an official gauge of manufacturing activity in China jumped in March, rebounding after hitting its lowest point in three years in February.
The report offered investors some reassurances that, after months of sluggish activity, China's economy was beginning to perk up. That comes as a relief to fund managers who have spent much of the year wondering whether soft patches across the global economy would be headed toward stabilization or further deterioration.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 329.74 points, or 1.3%, to 26258.42, while the S&P 500 advanced 32.79 points, or 1.2%, to 2867.19 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 99.59 points, or 1.3%, to 7828.91.
Bond yields soared, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 2.496% from 2.416% Fridayâits biggest one-day rise since January. Yields rise as bond prices fall.
""We don't see a reason why the global economy can't continue to advance at a slow and steady pace,"" said Craig Birk, chief investment officer at Personal Capital.
To be sure, recent data have continued to offer a mixed read on growth. Separate reports Monday pointed to further loss of momentum among major manufacturers like Germany, Japan and South Korea. Still, ""we don't see anything flashing red yet,"" which should bode well for stock gains, Mr. Birk added.
Energy shares rose 1.4% in the S&P 500, following crude oil prices higher.
Noble Energy Inc. added 95 cents, or 3.8%, to $25.68 and Valero Energy Corp. jumped 1.9% to $86.43.
Financial stocks rose as bond yields rebounded. Banks tend to benefit from higher interest rates because they boost their lending profitability.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rose $4.75, or 2.5%, to $196.74 and Morgan Stanley added $1.33, or 3.2%, to $43.53.
Lyft Inc. shares missed out on the broader market rally, tumbling to reverse course after their market debut last week. Shares lost $9.28, or 12%, to $69.01, below Friday's IPO price of $72.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 index climbed 1.2% for its best one-day percentage gain since February.
Turkish markets showed signs of stabilizing despite a weak showing in local elections over the weekend for the ruling party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The votes were seen by investors as a referendum on Mr. ErdoÄan's leadership and economic policies as the country grapples with high inflation and slowing growth. Attempts by Turkey to support its currency appeared to backfire last week, causing a market turmoil .
The Borsa Istanbul 100 stock index rose 0.3% on Monday.
Meanwhile, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.5%, advancing for a third straight session, as lawmakers in Parliament attempted to identify the least unpopular Brexit strategy.
The U.K. has less than 10 days to come up with a plan for how to leave the European Union or to try to remain part of the bloc for a longer period.
Fears of the U.K. dropping out of the European Union with no trade arrangements are giving an unusual short-term boost to the economy, with data on Monday showing a big increase in companies adding to stocks of supplies and finished goods ahead of Brexit.

Avoid Catching China's Spring Fever; March brought some good economic news from Chinaâbut this should be taken with a dollop of salt,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2200603142?accountid=14586,"Is spring in the air for the Chinese economy? Unreliable data is a poor guide.
A March gauge of factory activity in the world's second-largest economy was its strongest in six months and a similar private index also rebounded strongly. But early spring is always a tricky time for Chinese economic data. The shifting dates of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, new loan quotas for banks and other seasonal factors make the first quarter difficult to read. China's economy may have improved modestly last month, but the jump in the purchasing managers index back into growth territory above 50âagainst 49.2 in Februaryâprobably exaggerates the uptick.
The distortion was already evident in the February trade and industrial data, both of which came in at multiyear lows . Last year, the Lunar New Year was quite late, starting on Feb. 16, meaning more of the seasonal ebb in activity reached into March. This year, it was earlier, leading to a weak February and stronger March. China's statistics bureau does try to correct for the problem, but probably doesn't fully succeed. Since the end of 2009, the standard deviation of China's manufacturing PMI, a measure of data variability, has been 26% higher for January, February and March than for all other months.
That being said, there are reasons for guarded optimism. First, after being stuck at sky-high levels for two years, low-rated bond yields have eased marginally since December. Usually, lower borrowing costs take six to nine months to affect the economy. But since small, private firms have been cash-starved for so long, they could be plowing new borrowings into investment quicker this time too. Infrastructure investment also continues to recover after last year's funding drought.
Investors should watch to see if borrowing costs come down furtherâand whether incipient weakness in the property market worsens . Those are likely to be more reliable guides than March's fevered factory rebound.

"Steel Yourself for More Trouble in China; China may not re-enter outright deflation, but it is far from out of the woods","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2202127466?accountid=14586,"Chinese policy makers are worried that recent price gains for steel and other industrial materials aren't sustainable. That should worry investors, too.
Markets are celebrating the return of Chinese manufacturing to growth in March, based on the most recent purchasing managers index . A surge in both output and prices suggested growth remains strong enough to keep China out of deflation. The last round of falling prices , in 2015, tripped up state-owned steelmakers and nearly upended the country's financial system, as well as helping tank commodity markets world-wide.
Chinese officials apparently see things differently: Seasonal steel output restrictions, usually ending in April, will be extended through June in China's two largest steelmaking cities, Reuters reported Monday.
According to the chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association, nearly a quarter of steel firms made losses in the first two months of the year, up 10 percentage points. Pricier iron ore following a Brazilian dam disaster is clearly a factor, but officials obviously doubt buyers in sectors such as housing and infrastructure are really strong enough to bear much higher prices for steel and other industrial goods.
The nitty-gritty of the PMI bears that out. Since mid-2018, Chinese manufacturing output growth has largely outrun new ordersâthe opposite of the situation from late 2016 to early 2018, when that gap was closing rapidly and global prices were rising. That means downward price pressure. Not coincidentally, Chinese producer price inflation has slowed since then, hovering just above zero in February.
Matters have improved a bit since November, but the gap between the PMI output and orders components is still roughly twice what it was in mid-2018. China may not re-enter outright deflation, but it is far from out of the woods. Markets are celebrating too soon.

The blue-chip index advanced 166.50 points, or 0.6%, to 26384.63, driven by gains in trade-sensitive stocks such as materials-science firm Dow and aerospace giant Boeing, which added 5% and 2.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ticked up 5.99 points, or 0.2%, to 2879.39, as losses in technology shares kept other gains in check. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 3.77 points, or less than 0.1%, to 7891.78.
All three major indexes are up at least 1.6% for the week, with the S&P 500 up for six consecutive days, its longest winning streak since February 2018.
Liu He, China's vice premier, will visit the White House on Thursday afternoon after market hours. Experts say a potential further summit between Mr. Trump and China's President Xi Jinping would signal negotiators are nearing an agreement. Ahead of Thursday's meeting, Mr. Trump said the trade deal was moving along ""nicely.""
Jason Daw, head of emerging markets strategy at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, warned that a trade deal might be just a first step in a continuing conflict between the two nations.
""The trade-war issue itself is a small part of a large economic, geopolitical, military tension between the U.S. and China,"" Mr. Daw said, noting U.S. officials may see a potential deal as setting the tone for future tensions. ""If they can't come to something that they can believe is to their benefit on this topic, how are they going to come to resolutions on much bigger topics?""
Global markets have jumped this week, extending the bullish sentiment from the beginning of the year, fueled by dovish comments from the Federal Reserve. However, analysts say worries about global growth remain following some disappointing economic data .
Investors have read recent commentary from the Fed and the European Central Bank, which have pledged to put off rate increases, as a signal that top policy makers see a slowdown ahead, according to Bhanu Baweja, a strategist at UBS.
""There are times when bad news is good news, but there are times when bad news is bad news,"" he said.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, rose 0.1%.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury edged down to 2.512% Thursday from 2.517% on Wednesday. Yields move inversely to prices.
With the trade dispute threatening to weigh further on growth in the world's two largest economies, investors will be watching closely when the March U.S. jobs report is published Friday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the U.S. economy to have added 170,000 to payrolls in March and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.8%.
""The U.S. economy has a few crosscurrents, but wage growth and housing are generally really good, helping to prop up the economy relative to the rest of the world,"" said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group.

"EU Strong-Arms China Into Trade Promises; Europe clinches new vows from China on technology transfer, state subsidies as Beijing-Washington talks continue","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2205339580?accountid=14586,"BRUSSELSâThe European Union-China summit here Tuesday was meant to bolster cooperation, especially against controversial policies of President Trump. Instead, it is highlighting differences, led by growing trade tensions.
At their gathering with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker pressed China on unfulfilled promises . China bowed to EU demands to uphold its nascent partnership with Europe, as Beijing tries to end a bruising trade war with the U.S.
Departing from its previous stance, China agreed with the EU to end forced technology transfers and strengthen international rules on industrial subsidies. Beijing has guarded its support schemes as drivers of China's economic model.
""It is a breakthrough,"" Mr. Tusk said in a joint press briefing with Messrs. Li and Juncker. ""For the first time China has agreed to engage with Europe on this key priority.""
Tuesday's dynamics mark a shift from just two years ago, when the EU and China seized on their summit to hail strengthening ties as a bulwark against Mr. Trump's ""America First"" policies. Brussels hoped that with Beijing at its side, the EU could uphold international rules on issues from climate change to trade.
This time, however, European officials strong-armed their Chinese counterparts. They threatened until the last minute to kill a painstakingly drafted joint statement unless China signed on to the language relating to technology transfer, subsidies and other EU concerns. China agreed to most major concessions by the morning of the summit, seeking to secure a positive outcome, EU officials said.
""It serves them well to show that they can agree something with the European Union at a time they are negotiating with the U.S.,"" an EU diplomat said.
Europeans also pushed Beijing to accept a 2020 deadline to conclude an investment agreement amid increasing frustration with China's refusal to dial down its state capitalism, which Europeans see as harmful. The investment pact, under negotiation since 2013, is a cornerstone of Brussels' efforts to resolve trade issues with China.
While the recent shift in the EU signals a tougher stance against China, the bloc still prefers coaxing Beijing into action, rather than slapping it with huge tariffs as Mr. Trump did to force China into negotiations.
The EU also secured additional market-access pledges from China and set up monitoring mechanisms to track progress. But it remains an open question whether the bloc can enforce the agreement or get China to move on updating global rules on industrial subsidies.
Previously, the EU and China missed their target date for a pact on geographical indications, which protect brands including Champagne sparkling wine from France and Parma ham from Italy. The EU and China agreed at last year's summit in Beijing to complete such a pact by October 2018. On Tuesday, they reset the deadline to the end of this year.
""The Chinese will give enough to have a joint statement,"" said Jonathan Holslag, an international politics instructor at the Free University Brussels. ""That's a tactic China has used heavily in the pastâto let some concerns fade slowly. This time it's not going to be different.""
The U.S. has faced similar challenges with China. The White House is currently pushing for clauses that would allow Washington to unilaterally reimpose tariffs unless Beijing delivers on its commitments. China has resisted that demand, seeking to woo the Trump administration with purchase and market-access offers that would reduce the U.S. trade deficit.
Ahead of the EU-China summit, President Xi Jinping visited Italy , Monaco and France to allay similar concerns. Parrying European and U.S. criticism over Beijing's treatment of foreign firms, he said China had grown so rapidly thanks to 40 years of market reforms and liberalization.
""China will continue to push forward reform and opening up,"" Mr. Xi said last month in Paris, flanked by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU's Mr. Juncker.
On Tuesday, Mr. Li echoed the Chinese president, saying the EU and China ""should work hand in hand"" to uphold the global economic order. He also said Beijing would in June curtail its list of industries in which foreign companies are banned from operating, an action that would expand access to the Chinese market.
EU officials said they expect to secure broader access for European firms to financial services and some other sectors, but didn't have specific information on which areas China intended to liberalize. The outcome of U.S.-China trade talks would also determine the scope of Beijing's measures, EU officials said.
Meanwhile, momentum against China's economic practices has been mounting in the EU.
European industry groups and officials say Beijing's policies handicap EU companies while Chinese investors enjoy near unfettered access the bloc's single market.
Responding to concerns about trade relations with China, the EU enacted an investment-screening framework this year, partially to counter Chinese acquisitions in strategic sectors. In March, the bloc called China an ""economic competitor"" and ""systemic rival."" Then EU leaders resurrected a proposal to allow access to the EU's vast public-procurement market on a reciprocal basis after discussing China relations.
""We need to find a better balance and level of reciprocity,"" Mr. Juncker said Tuesday. ""Progress is slower than we would like.""
The U.S. has also been lobbying hard in Europe to prevent Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. from participating in 5G networks.
Some EU members adopted measures on that question, and the bloc's executive last month outlined steps for joint cybersecurity efforts, starting with a risk assessment due in October and mitigating measures by year's end.
Despite the challenges in EU-China relations, the sides still signed deals to boost energy and competition cooperation at the summit.
""Common interests on the two sides far outweigh our differences,"" Mr. Li said.

At the time, the Myanmar government said the port did not need to be so big or require so much debt. Officials managed to hammer out a new deal with China, a country better known for making lopsided arrangements with weaker countries than for backing down in talks.
But Myanmar also had outside help: A team of U.S. economists, diplomats and lawyers had been dispatched to the country on a pilot program to scrutinize contracts, flag bad deals, and empower the country to push for better terms with Chinese agencies and companies, according to current and former U.S. government officials.
It may become a regular strategy by the U.S. to counter China's growing influence, especially in Asia and the Pacific where Beijing has been working to expand its diplomatic, economic and military clout . The State Department hopes to use such teams elsewhere against what Washington charges is Beijing's practice of using debt and investment to exert influence .

The U.S. Agency for International Development led the way on the program, the State Department official said. ""AID had technical experts come in and look at a deal and say, 'Is this structured the way you want it? What's the viability?'"" the official said. ""At the end of the day, it's a matter of providing greater transparency into what a deal is all about and if it makes sense for the country in question.""
USAID officials said in a statement that they undertook ""public investment planning"" as part of a broad economic growth program for Myanmar. ""This is part of our consistent position to help governments throughout the region interested in developing the technical capacity to do the due diligence needed to assess possible investments and projectsâregardless of the source of financing,"" a USAID official said.
Myanmar officials said the effort was locally driven, without any outside help. Commerce Minister Than Myint said the renegotiation ensured Myanmar avoided a debt trap and provided a ""win-win"" for Myanmar and China. He said the port project could be expanded later if Myanmar wanted.
Technical experts with experience examining the fine print of infrastructure contracts were deployed to Myanmar. They passed along advice to local officials, according to a former senior official in the U.S. government with Myanmar experience.
A person familiar with the negotiations said Myanmar's government reached out to the U.S. to request help reviewing the contract to ensure it didn't include any hidden traps. This person said other Western countries, including the U.K. and Australia, provided similar assistance.
The negotiations ""were very much Burmese-led but armed with the advice of the Americans and others as well. We were able to go to the Chinese [and say], 'This part is OK, this part is problematic in terms of debt,'"" the person said, referring to the country by its previous name.
The Myanmar port deal is part of an economic and diplomatic influence campaign known as the Belt and Road Initiative , a signature effort by Chinese President Xi Jinping to dot the globe with Chinese-funded infrastructure projects.
Myanmar was known for sometimes taking tough stands on past Chinese infrastructure projects and other investments, even when it was still led by former military officials and it had a weak relationship with the U.S. While military rule formally ended in 2011, retired officers dominated the country until elections in 2015 vaulted Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to power.
However, ties between Myanmar and the U.S. have grown strained amid concerns over the country's military campaign against the Rohingya minority , which left approximately 10,000 dead and forced more than 700,000 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh.
It seemed to provide China with an opportunity to pull Myanmar into its orbit, but continued U.S. assistance helped the Southeast Asian nation push back against Beijing's terms on the port project.
China's Foreign Ministry defended its investment initiative, saying 150 countries have signed cooperation agreements. ""A large number of projects have taken root, blossomed and borne fruit,"" a Foreign Ministry statement said. ""The eyes of the masses are sharp. History has proven it time and again that people who do good will be welcome.""
But Beijing has faced criticism over Belt and Road, particularly after Sri Lanka in late 2017 was unable to keep up with its payments to Beijing and turned over control of a major Chinese-funded port .
""China has hurt itself, the Belt and Road brand has been somewhat tarnished around Sri Lanka,"" said Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia Project, which tracks Chinese projects and is part of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
""This is something the United States should be doing more of,"" he said of the Myanmar advisory team. ""Help developing countries be their best advocates.""
The $7.3 billion Myanmar project was developed in 2015 between the previous military-dominated government and Chinese state-owned Citic Group. The plan called for a rail line from China to the town of Kyaukpyu, with the intent of transforming it into a major deep-water port and industrial zone.
But later, the Myanmar government under civilian leader Ms. Suu Kyi announced the plan would be reduced to a $1.3 billion deal, with just two jetties, able to be expanded later if necessary.
USAID Administrator Mark Green has said U.S. efforts to help developing countries recognize onerous terms that come with Chinese-funded debt is an extension of international outreach in the spirit of the post-World War II Marshall Plan.
China offers easy money up front, he said in a 2018 address , ""but it also secures conditions and indebtedness that I would argue essentially mortgage a country's future.""
Mr. Hillman said the economic advice has to be objective, or the U.S. government risks looking as if it is dissuading rather than advising. The U.S. also must be prepared to extend its own aid and funding, he said. ""The worst outcomes in developing countries is when the only offer is a Chinese offer,"" he said.

U.S.-China Trade Pact Takes Aim at Currency Manipulation; Deal could include penalties for China if it manipulates its currency to increase exports,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2207980312?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTONâAs part of a prospective deal on trade , the U.S. and China have agreed to measures that American officials say will deter Beijing from currency manipulation by requiring greater disclosure of economic actions, according to current and former officials familiar with the negotiations.
The deal could also include penalties for China if it manipulates its currency to increase exports, which is in violation of international guidelines, these people say.
""The fundamental issue on currency across the board is we want to make sure people meet their obligations, that they don't devalue their currency for competitive purposes,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview. ""That's the objective.""
The trade deal is still under negotiation and American officials caution that nothing will be final until both sides agree on all points.
Even so, an enforceable currency measure ""would be significant and would represent a further step forward into bringing discipline to the currency-manipulation issue,"" said Fred Bergsten, a former top Treasury Department official and co-founder of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The measures for greater economic disclosure are aimed at spotlighting monetary policies that fit the pattern of currency manipulation. Beijing doesn't disclose the composition of its foreign-exchange reservesâwhich at $3 trillion as of last month are the world's largestâor its purchases in currency markets. That makes it difficult to assess whether Beijing is manipulating the yuan.
China's central bank governor, Yi Gang, indicated at a news conference last month that better disclosure of the central bank's forex operations would be part of the deal .
The currency provisions and the overall deal's enforcement system have already been hammered out as a part of the sprawling U.S.-China trade agreement, a work-in-progress that is meant to end the dispute, U.S. officials say.
Treasury officials declined to provide more information on the currency enforcement rules and a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer declined to comment. A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
A senior Treasury official said the U.S.-China agreement on currency has similarities to the North American Free Trade Agreement revamp that the Trump administration signed last year with Canada and Mexico. The forex deal also has ""certain aspects that go beyond"" the new, unratified Nafta deal, known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement , or USMCA.
Economists and politicians in recent years have grown more worried about countries manipulating their currencies to favor exports over imports, effectively reducing or eliminating the gains that companies operating in one currency get from lower tariffs negotiated in trade agreements.

Such currency manipulation isn't allowed under the guidelines of international organizationsâincluding the Group of 20 leading global economiesâbut these organizations don't have enforcement mechanisms to hold countries to account.
Major economies and their central banks have been reluctant to tie their own hands when it comes to monetary tools, seeing it as a key part of economic sovereignty.
In 2016, President Trump said he would formally declare China a currency manipulator when he took office, but his administration backed down on that promise. Administration officials say China hasn't intervened recently to cheapen its currency but could do so in the future.
Many U.S. lawmakers and some exporting industries have long pressed for currency rules in trade agreements. The Obama administration in 2015 spearheaded a nonbinding currency understanding among the U.S. and 11 Pacific countries included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But Mr. Trump withdrew from that agreement .
Then last year, the Trump administration included an currency portion in the USMCA, which awaits Congressional approval. The USMCA language was seen as a deterrent to manipulation. Still, only a section on transparency will be enforceable if the new North American deal enters into force, economists say.
Some expect the China pact to go further on enforcement than just requiring transparency, with penalties for violating international economic principles in ways that cheapen a national currency.
Mr. Bergsten said there is a ""possibility that the enforcement mechanism may have broader coverage, which would be significant and would represent a further step forward into bringing discipline to the currency-manipulation issue.""
Mr. Bergsten said the U.S. and China would likely solve currency disputes in similar fashion to strictly trade-related issues, perhaps with sets of consultations among economic or Treasury officials from the two nations, with tariffs and perhaps other sanctions allowed as penalties.
As a so-called executive agreement that wouldn't be submitted to Congress for ratification, the U.S.-China deal wouldn't have the same legal structure as a free-trade agreement. Some members of Congress worry the pact could improperly change U.S. trade policies without their approval.

Daimler Earnings Slump as Weaker China Sales Hits Mercedes; Profits at the company's Mercedes-Benz car division were hit by a drop in China sales,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2214925994?accountid=14586,"BERLINâGerman luxury car maker Daimler AG reported a 37% drop in first-quarter earnings in its core car division, citing weak sales in China and a rapidly slowing global economy that hit its business in major markets.
Daimler on Friday said profits at the Mercedes-Benz car division, the company's biggest, were hit by a 3% drop in China sales and an increase in the share of low-margin models in the company's overall product mix. The return on Mercedes-Benz cars sales fell to 6.1% from 9% a year earlier.
""We had a comparatively weak start to the year and face numerous challenges along the entire value chain in all our automotive divisions. This had a negative impact on unit sales and earnings,"" Daimler CFO Bodo Uebber told reporters.
The results weren't a surprise and Daimler's shares were off less than 1% in midmorning European trading. But the results underlined the headwinds that have converged on global auto makers and Germany's flagship industry in particularâfrom the softer economy in China, global trade tensions , the costs of moving to electric vehicles and the difficulties in adapting to new emission rules in Europe.
Analysts see Daimler's weak first quarter as a harbinger of more bad news to come as other auto makers disclose how the gathering global headwinds are hitting their businesses.
Daimler, the first large German car maker to report first-quarter earnings, said revenue across the entire group including trucks and financial services was â¬39.7 billion ($44.2 billion) in the three months to the end of March, unchanged from the previous year. Net profit fell 9% to â¬2.15 billion.
Underscoring the downward trend was auto supplier Continental AG, who announced its earnings in the first quarter fell 17% to â¬884 million. Revenue was nearly unchanged at â¬11 billion. The company is due to report detailed earnings on May 9.
Mercedes-Benz was hit particularly hard by slowing demand and bottlenecks related to delays in delivering vehicles to dealers because of difficulties certifying new vehicles under the new WLTP emissions testing regime. Production of sport-utility vehicles at Daimler's plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama is experiencing roadblocks related to difficulties bring on a new supplier for the GLA series, Mr. Uebber said.
Mercedes earnings before interest and taxes fell 37% to â¬1.3 billion, as revenue declined 8% to â¬21.2 billion. New Mercedes-Benz car sales fell 7% to 555,312 vehicles in the first three months of the year.
Despite the weak start to the year, Daimler stuck to its previous outlook of slight growth in unit sales, revenue and earnings this year, after cost-cutting measures are implemented and take effect.
""We cannot and will not be satisfied with this, as expected, moderate start to the year. We now have to work hard to achieve our targets for 2019,"" Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said in a statement.
Mr. Zetsche will step down as CEO in May. He will take a post on the company's supervisory board and is in line to become its chairman after a cooling off period. He will hand over the reins to Ola KÃ¤llenius, who is currently a board member in charge of research and development, at a time when the company is losing traction against rival BMW AG.
Mr. KÃ¤llenius, a native of Sweden and a big backer of electric vehicles , has been lobbying internally for the overhaul of the company's product range and making steep cost cuts. In a recent note to employees on the company's internal website, Mr. KÃ¤llenius said: ""Mercedes is a luxury brand. But that doesn't mean we have the luxury of being careless with budgets.""
Some company officials over the past few weeks have said that Mercedes could make cuts ranging from reducing travel budgets and ordering less catering for internal meetings to cutting the number of models it makes from around 40 currently and reducing the number of engines it offers customers.
During the news conference, Mr. Uebber wouldn't provide any details on planned cuts or confirm that as many as 10,000 jobs could be shed.

"Drugmakers Brace for Sales to Slow in China Amid Generic Drug Push; AstraZeneca, Sanofi report upbeat earning s but warn of challenge in China","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://log in.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2214963370?accountid=14586,"As global companies struggle with an economic slowdown in China, big drugmakers have a different problem: local competition is starting to bite.
Executives at Sanofi SA and AstraZeneca PLC on Friday said they expect strong growth in China to slow later this year as hospitals switch to Chinese-made generic versions of some of their top-selling drugs.
Multinationals have for years benefited from strong sales of some of their older medicines in China, where brand recognition gave them an edge over cheaper copies. Robust sales growth in China was a factor in upbeat results for both companies in the first quarter.
But that source of revenue is about to take a big hit. In an effort to lower drug costs, the Chinese government earlier this year rolled out a policy aimed at getting large public hospitals to switch to generics. Beijing has also been raising standards for its domestic drugmakers, closing the gap in quality with the multinationals.
The policy required drugmakers to bid for contracts to become the sole supplier of a certain drug to all public hospitals in 11 key cities. Multinational companies won just two of the 25 contracts, with the rest going to Chinese generic drugmakers. The contracts came into effect around the end of the first quarter.
Two of Sanofi's best sellers in China, blood thinner Plavix and Aprovel for lowering blood pressure, will be replaced by Chinese-made drugs at the country's public hospitals. A company spokesman said the cities affected represented around 30% of nationwide demand for these products.
AstraZeneca also expects China sales to slow later this year. While the British drugmaker won a contract for lung cancer drug Iressa, its cholesterol-busting pill Crestor lost out to a lower-cost version.
Pfizer Inc.'s Lipitor and Novartis AG's Gleevec were also among the big-name drugs that lost out to Chinese-made generics.
China has recently made a raft of policy changes aimed at improving access to medicines for its 1.4 billion population. Some of theseâsuch as speedier approvals of new drugsâ are benefiting multinational companies .
""The good news here is that China is very much focusing on innovation,"" said AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot. He said some of the company's new drugs, including Tagrisso for lung cancer, were performing well in China.
Sanofi is also counting on new drugs to drive growth in China. A spokesman said seven of its drugs were included in a list of medicines that could be eligible for a faster-than-normal approval by the Chinese regulator.
The French company on Friday said business net income, a closely watched measure that strips out certain one-time items, rose 10.5% to â¬1.77 billion ($1.97 billion), while sales rose 6.2% to â¬8.39 billion in the three months to March 31.
Both measures beat analyst expectations, sending shares up 3.5% in early trading, although Sanofi's Chief Financial Officer Jean-Baptiste Chasseloup de Chatillon said the company had opted not to raise its full-year guidance because of the anticipated slowdown in China.
AstraZeneca said its core operating profit, an adjusted measure, climbed 84% to $1.65 billion in the quarter because of stronger margins and higher product sales, which rose 10% to $5.47 billion. AstraZeneca shares climbed 0.1% Friday morning.

"U.S. Meat Companies Gain From Hog Culling in China; Swine fever has decimated China's herds, creating opportunity for other protein companies","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2215819163?accountid=14586,"U.S. hogs remain free of African swine fever, a disease that has forced the culling of millions of hogs in China. PHOTO: Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal
A deadly disease sweeping China's hog barns is reinvigorating the fortunes of U.S. meat companies.
Outbreaks of African swine fever have led to the culling of millions of hogs in the world's top pork market . That is shrinking global meat suppliesâand boosting prices. The shift is a welcome one for U.S. meatpackers and farmers, whose hogs remain free of the disease , after a tough patch of low prices driven by record U.S. meat production and China's tariffs on U.S. meat.
The disease isn't dangerous to humans, scientists say, but causes skin lesions, organ failure and near-certain death in pigs.
China's agricultural ministry estimated recently that there were 19% fewer hogs in the country in March than a year earlier. Losing that much pork output in the country that is home to half the world's pigs would cut the global meat supply by some 6% on an annualized basis, according to Heather Jones, an analyst with investment firm Vertical Group.
""That's unprecedented,"" Ms. Jones said. ""There's just not enough supply out there to replace this.""
U.S. pork producers like Ron Prestage are eager to fill part of that gap.
Last month, Mr. Prestage's company, Prestage Farms Inc., opened a $309 million pork processing plant in Iowa. Throughout 2018, Mr. Prestage watched nervously as tariffs from China and Mexico depressed U.S. pork prices, at the same time that expansion in the U.S. meat industry drove domestic pork production to a record 26.3 billion pounds.
The picture changed late last year, when Mr. Prestage began fielding calls from Chinese buyers asking when his plant might be able to start exporting pork. He said he met with Chinese officials last week. The recent surge in pork pricesâcarcass prices have climbed 40% in the last 2 monthsâmeans his family's plant now is likely to turn a profit in 2020, he said.
""It's going to help us get a leg up quicker than we expected,"" Mr. Prestage said.
Combined, China and Hong Kong bought 495,637 metric tons of U.S. pork in 2017, before tariffs that took effect last year sapped that flow to 351,774 tons in 2018, according to data compiled by the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Now, China's purchases in the past two weeks alone have totaled 101,200 metric tons, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show, even as the tariffs remain in effect.
Tyson Foods Inc. last month secured approval for two plants in Iowa to begin shipping pork to China, the first such approvals for U.S. pork facilities since January 2016, according to USDA data. Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, owned by China-based WH Group, is reconfiguring some plants to produce more boxed carcasses to ship to China.
A global drawdown in meat supplies will also boost poultry processors like Pilgrim's Pride Corp., Sanderson Farms Inc. and Tyson, analysts said. Chickens' shorter lifespans allow producers to expand production quickly, and Chinese consumers are expected to supplement some of the pork they would have bought with poultry.
""They are going to import much more protein this year, period,"" said AndrÃ© Nogueira de Souza, head of U.S. operations for Brazilian meatpacking giant JBS SA, on a March 29 conference call.
China's taste for U.S. pork is also expanding into new cuts of meat. Chinese importers have long bought U.S. byproducts like feet, hearts and heads , but buyers now are placing orders for entire hog carcasses, U.S. meat-industry officials said.

That shift could drive up prices for U.S. staples like bacon and sausages, analysts said. Since the start of the year, per-pound prices have more than doubled for pork trim, used to make sausage, according to USDA data. Prices for pork bellies, used for bacon, climbed 21% before easing back late last week. Those increases have yet to translate to higher prices at restaurants and grocery stores, but consumers could pay more for pork later this year if the hog culling continues, said Christine McCracken, executive director of meat research at Rabobank, a top agricultural lender.
U.S. meatpackers like Smithfield, JBS and Tyson are also spending more to purchase pigs from farmers. U.S. hog farmers in March earned an average $8.47 per pig, their first positive monthly return since October, according to estimates from Iowa State University.
Filling China's pork gap could also boost grain companies like Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill Inc. Archer Daniels CEO Juan Luciano said hog farmers in the U.S., Europe and Brazil are preparing to expand their herds to supply more pork to China, requiring more corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients supplied by grain merchants.
For Pam Janssen, whose family sells some 6,000 hogs annually from their farm near Minonk, Ill., the higher prices haven't made up for losses last year when tariffs pushed down prices.
""It's better than it was, but it's got a long way to go,"" she said.

Trump Issues Tariff Threat and China Considers Pulling Out of Talks; President's warning to China takes Beijing by surprise,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn. edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2220067689?accountid=14586,"President Trump threatened to drastically ramp up U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, a surprise twist that put an accord in doubt as Beijing considered pulling out of talks scheduled to begin this week.
In a pair of Twitter messages Sunday, Mr. Trump wrote he planned to raise levies on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25% starting Friday, from 10% currently. He also wrote he would impose 25% tariffs ""shortly"" on $325 billion in Chinese goods that haven't yet been taxed.
""The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate,"" the president tweeted. ""No!""
Mr. Trump's tweets surprised many Chinese officials, according to a person briefed on the matter Monday, and China is considering canceling trade talks that are to resume in Washington starting Wednesday. There has been widespread expectations in recent days that an accord could be reached by Friday.
""China shouldn't negotiate with a gun pointed to its head,"" the person said. A decision on whether to go ahead with the talks this week hasn't been made, the person said.
Chinese officials have said Beijing wouldn't bend to pressure tactics. By potentially scotching the trip, Beijing would be following up on its pledge to avoid negotiating under threat.
The timing of Mr. Trump's threat triggered speculation that it was aimed at pressuring China and scoring points domestically.
""With President Trump, you never know, but there is a good chance that this is just a threat,"" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""If they announce a deal later this week, it will make it appear as if he acted as tough as possible to get the deal.""
Mr. Trump, a Republican, has long said tariffs give him leverage in trade deals, whether they involve China or allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union.
""The president is, I think, issuing a warning hereâ¦saying, 'Guess what, the tariffs will remain' if China does not agree to trade negotiations,"" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday on Fox News.
But it is far from clear that the U.S. would actually raise tariffs on Friday. That is because the U.S. trade representative may believe he needs to give U.S. industry notice of a substantial tariff change, people who follow the talks said. U.S. officials have moved slowly in implementing tariffs, fearing they could open the door to a legal challenge that could halt their use of the levies.
The prospect of an escalation of tariffs, which would boost the price of imports ranging from retail items to industrial electronic components, drew immediate fire from U.S. trade groups that import goods from China.
""Taxing Americans when they buy furniture, tools, electronics and groceries should have nothing to do with reaching this agreement,"" said a statement from Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a coalition of U.S. trade associations. ""This isn't leverage to get a better deal, it's taking money out of the pockets of hardworking Americans.""
Rick Helfenbein, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said more tariffs would ""add additional obstacles to economic growth."" His group estimated that raising tariffs on apparel imports to 25% would raise costs for a family of four by about $500 a year.
Mr. Trump hasn't threatened additional tariffs on Chinese goods since his Dec. 1 summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires, where the two nations started a big push to resolve a trade dispute that had rattled global markets before U.S. markets bounced back sharply. Some analysts said the latest threats could trigger renewed market declines; U.S. stock futures were lower after they resumed trading Sunday evening.
""When the president puts his foot down, it makes the market go down,"" said Chris Rupkey, managing director and chief financial economist at MUFG.
Mr. Trump's threats also left Chinese officials facing another urgent task early Monday morning: how to prevent the Chinese stock market from plunging on the news. A rebound in Chinese shares this yearâcoinciding with the trade talksâhas helped boost business confidence in the world's second-largest economy.
In February, Mr. Trump said he would delay a planned increase of tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, due March 1, citing ""substantial progress"" on issues including intellectual property and technology transfer in the two nations' trade talks. But the two sides haven't resolved some issues that are important to both, and last rounds of negotiations invariably involve brinkmanship on both sides.
China wants the U.S. to at least start to roll back tariffs once any deal is signed. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, though, wants to keep tariffs in place and start removing them once China shows it is complying with terms of any agreement.
""Trump has upped the ante yet again, blindsiding the Chinese who thought they were negotiating towards a pullback of existing tariffs, not fending off new ones,"" said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. As a result, he said, the stakes are even higher now for China.""
One particularly tough demand: the U.S. wants to retain the ability to reimpose tariffs if it believes China is reneging on the deal but wants to deny Beijing the ability to retaliate with tariffs of its own. The U.S. says it needs to make sure a reimposition of tariffs won't lead to a new round of trade fights. Beijing is balking at the idea that the U.S. would have unilateral ability to impose tariffs.
China is also resisting U.S. demands that Beijing open its cloud-computing market to U.S. firms and more rapidly approve U.S. agricultural products that are now held up over Beijing's claims that they aren't safe. Also at issue is how long of a period to give new U.S. pharmaceuticals protection from Chinese competition.
Those issues were all the subjects of talks last week in Beijing , which U.S. officials had said were productive. But a May 2 article in China's Global Times, which often takes a nationalist perspective, speculated that the two sides may ""have hit an impasse in the tough talks.""
Along with putting pressure on Chinese negotiators, the U.S. may figure that the threat of new tariffs could help Chinese trade envoy Liu He rally support for a deal among China's divided bureaucracy. Mr. Liu has long argued that China's economy should be more open to foreign competition. He and other Chinese reformers have used the threat of foreign pressure to argue that they must make changes opposed by conservative forces in China's ruling Communist Party.
That tactic, however, also carries the risk of spawning a nationalist backlash in China. In September 2018, for instance, Mr. Liu was planning a trip to Washington to continue negotiations that at the time seemed promising. About a week before he was due, however, Mr. Trump said he would go ahead with the tariffs on the $200 billion of Chinese imports. The surprise announcement prompted Mr. Xi to cancel the trip and wait until the November elections, hoping that a Republican electoral defeat would make the U.S. more amenable to a deal.
Around the same time, U.S. markets started to fall, with analysts blaming the fight with China as one reason for the decline. Mr. Trump started to become more interested in negotiations, calling Mr. Xi on Nov. 1 to press him to discuss a deal when the two leaders met a month later in Buenos Aires.

Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, declined with stocks and other riskier assets and as investors reallocated to the safety of U.S. government debt. Treasurys' reliable interest payments tend to become more attractive when the prospects for the economy are less certain.
The U.S. and China are the world's largest economies, setting the pace of consumption and manufacturing around the world, driving demand for commodities such as oil and copper, as well as finished goods such as autos and consumer electronics. Growth in Europe, whose economies are fueled by exports and trade, has been hard hit by slowing consumer demand from China.
""The market's concerned that maybe things will get worse before they get better,"" said Donald Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at Federated Investors. ""We're seeing this reflected in risk assets, and that's created a flight-to-quality.""

Mr. Ellenberger said he has added to his holdings of U.S. government debt as tensions have increased.
Increased tariffs on imports from China are set to kick in early Friday, and China has vowed to retaliate. Higher tariffs are likely to slow trade between the two largest economies and contribute to a further slowdown in global economic growth, analysts said.
Adding to the pressure, the U.S. formally filed paperwork Wednesday to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from the current 10% at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Beijing's Commerce Ministry responded by threatening to take unspecified countermeasures. At a campaign rally in Florida Wednesday night, President Trump said Chinese leaders ""broke the deal"" in trade talks with the U.S.
The 10-year yield hovered near the rate on three-month Treasury bills, briefly falling below the shorter-term rate Thursday. Investors and Fed officials closely watch the dispersion of short- and longer-term yieldsâknown as the yield curveâbecause the three-month yield has exceeded the 10-year yield ahead of every recession since 1975.
Three-month and 10-year yields inverted for about one week in March, with shorter-term yields exceeding those for longer-term debt for the first time since August 2007.

U.S. ambitions under pressure by crises in China, North Korea, Iran and Venezuela","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2222244206?accountid=14586,"President Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy is being challenged on four fronts at once, creating an extraordinary test of the White House's ability to manage multiple crises and deliver on its ambitious agenda.
In Asia, China is seeking to renegotiate the terms of yearslong trade talks. North Korea is again testing short-range missiles , with talks over Pyongyang's nuclear forces stalled.
In the Middle East, Iran is threatening to ramp up its nuclear program and, according to U.S. intelligence, has prepared to attack American forces. In Latin America, Venezuela has thwarted a U.S.-backed change-of-government campaign, with Russian and Cuban support.
The array of difficulties the administration faces was underscored Thursday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cut short a diplomatic trip to rush to Washington for a top-level meeting that was also attended by Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford.
What makes the moment all the more unusual is that Mr. Trump has put aside the time-honored practice of setting foreign-policy prioritiesâhandling one, then another, foreign-policy analysts say.
Instead, Mr. Trump has simultaneously doubled down on an array of goals, any one of which would be an ambitious single undertaking for a U.S. administration: the remaking of China's economic model, the denuclearization of North Korea, a wholesale change in Iran's security policy and the ousting of a Latin American government.
""In all of these cases, the administration had staked out an extraordinary definition of success,"" said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a veteran of the George W. Bush administration. ""All of this is taking place with no serious interagency process and with a president who is allergic to the large-scale use of military power.
""There is an enormous gap between ends and means, and sanctions can't fill the gap,"" he said.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders played down the notion that the administration was in danger of being overwhelmed by events.
""Members of President Trump's National Security team had a routine meeting today to discuss a range of topics,"" she said Thursday.
Following the meeting, Mr. Pompeo threatened military force against Iran, while leaving open the possibility of eventual talks, saying, ""Any attacks by them or their proxies of any identity against U.S. interests or citizens will be answered with a swift and decisive U.S. response.""
To be sure, no president has the luxury of choosing what crises may emerge on his watch. The upheaval in Venezuela was spurred by the country's autocratic leader, while China's disregard for intellectual-property rights and trade tensions have long colored relations between Washington and Beijing. For the U.S., Iran has long posed an adversarial presence in the Middle East, and North Korea's nuclear ambitions are an old issue.
When discussing the trade dispute with China, Mr. Trump again argued that he is facing problems left behind by others. ""I blame our past leadership for allowing this to happen,"" he said Thursday. ""As president of our country, I had to do something about it.""
But some of the escalating tensions are the result of decisions in Washington. The Trump administration was still trying to sort out its trade fight with China and puzzle through the new diplomatic steps with North Korea after the failed February summit meeting in Hanoi and when it decided to ratchet up the economic pressure on Iran by issuing fresh curbs on Tehran's oil exports.

""We can't control Venezuela imploding, but Iran was in a frozen situation and they are creating a crisis that need not have happened at this time.""
The White House's determination to fight geopolitical battles simultaneously on multiple fronts also shows a disdain for some of the trade-offs long common to international diplomacy and politics. On the diplomatic front, the U.S. is seeking China's help in getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, even as it is raising tariffs on Beijing.
Militarily, the Pentagon's strategy has been to build up capabilities to deter China and Russia while shifting forces from the Middle East. Now, it has needed to make a course correction by sending an aircraft carrier and a bomber task force to the Middle East with possibly more deployments to come.
To a great extent, Mr. Trump's foreign policy reflects his leadership style, which is to stake out ambitious positions in the hope that the other side will blink.
The president's bold and unorthodox approach to foreign policy, his supporters say, already has led to some important milestones, such as the first-ever, top-level meeting between an American president and a North Korean leader. Even though North Korea is testing short-range missiles, it is still holding to a moratorium on long-range missile launches and nuclear tests.
And when it comes to using force, Mr. Trump appears to be more cautious than his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, who last year asked the Pentagon for options against Iran after a U.S. consulate came under mortar fire from Iraqi militias that officials suspect might have had Iranian support.
In the case of Iran, the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear agreement and to maximize economic pressure against Tehran has put it at odds with its European allies. And some former military officers have questioned the administration's capacity to deal with multiple crisis should tensions rapidly escalate.

"As Trump fights with China over trade, U.S.-China economic relationship already being redefined: Â  Trump says itâs a âprivilegeâ to do business in the U.S. But China is quickly becoming the biggest market for companies.","The Washington Post (Online); Washington, D.C.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2223074202?accountid=14586,"Chinese consumers for the first time last year bought more Cadillacs than Americans did, helping drive profits at General Motors. And though the designs for those Cadillacs may have been drafted in Detroit, nearly all of the luxury automobiles were assembled in China by some of GM's nearly 60,000 local workers.
This growing dynamic â of American companies serving Chinese consumers with products made in China â marks a shift in global trade that could pose a significant challenge to President Trump's ""America First"" agenda.
Trump has based his campaign to refashion economic relations with China on the well-established notion that the country undercut American workers through low-wage manufacturing of goods exported to the United States.
That campaign entered a new chapter this week when Trump once again hiked tariffs on Chinese goods after declaring himself dissatisfied with the pace of negotiations on a new trade agreement.
But whether he succeeds in securing a trade deal, many economists and executives say, the nature of the business relationship between the United States and China already is being redefined.
After four decades of economic reform, China is morphing from a low-wage exporter into the largest consumer market for a growing number of industries, including automobiles, video games and computers.
""We're at the end of a period of the globalization of production,"" said William Overholt, a senior fellow at Harvard University's Asia Center. ""We're at the beginning of a period of globalization of consumption in which the center of gravity moves from baby boomers in the west to the relatively young Chinese.""
A decade ago, for instance, Chinese consumers bought 71 percent of the products manufactured in China, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. Today, the Chinese buy 85 percent of what they produce â and their economy is three times larger.
By Â Â next year, China's per-person income will have doubled since 2010, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The phenomenon, which is also seen in other quickly developing countries like India and Indonesia, will create a new set of winners and losers.
In the United States, the principal beneficiaries of the era of globalized consumption are likely to be investors and highly skilled employees, rather than the blue-collar workers who suffered as companies moved overseas.
""It's definitely a profits story,"" said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""It'll have very little to do with any jobs here.""
In the past, Americans bought up the low-cost goods made in China, which was a boon for Chinese workers and also for cost-conscious Americans. But, in seeking to cater to the Chinese consumer, the reverse is not true. American companies instead are setting up factories there and in other developing markets.
Already, United States -based multinationals have been creating jobs faster in China than at home, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Since 2009, corporations have increased their Chinese workforce by 86 percent to 1.7 million â roughly four times the rate of increase at home.
For Trump, that means a trade policy that often seems to promise a return to an earlier era before globalization could disappoint, even if he secures a good deal with the Chinese.
Administration officials say they are making headway rebalancing trade relations with China and other countries to rectify mistakes made by Trump's predecessors. A new North American trade deal, for example, requires more auto manufacturing to be done in the United States. (It still needs to be passed by Congress.) The president's tariffs are credited with reviving steel production, one factor in the addition of 452,000 new manufacturing jobs during his tenure.
Other trends also could benefit the United States. Rising wages in countries such as China and increasing automation are making labor costs relatively less important in determining the location of new factories. That makes the U.S. more attractive as an investment destination, though rising automation means new plants require fewer American workers than the factories that closed earlier this century, vaporizing 6 million jobs.
In trade talks with Beijing, the administration also is seeking greater access to the Chinese market, which could aid U.S. export prospects. But the biggest new opportunities may do little for blue-collar workers who lost out over the past 20 years of growing U.S.-China trade ties.
U.S. negotiators are pushing the Chinese to open their markets for industries such as financial services, insurance and cloud computing. These are profitable endeavors, but ones that favor the well-educated and skilled.
The president has often portrayed a narrative of global commerce that puts the United States â not foreign markets â at the center. He calls it a ""privilege"" for other countries to sell into the U.S. market. And his decision to quit a 12-nation Pacific trade deal, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, on his fourth day in office left American companies at a disadvantage in key Asian markets at a time when developing countries are driving the growth in global demand.
Now, many executives say they do not expect the United States to reclaim its role as the globe's dominant market.
Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents companies such as Amazon, Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, said the administration's stance presents multinationals with a dilemma.
""A company told me today they feel some tension between what their shareholders are telling them and what the Trump administration is telling them,"" said Allen, a former U.S. diplomat. ""The administration is suggesting or emphasizing investment in the U.S. That's not where the market is; that's not where the market growth is.""
To be sure, despite consumption's blossoming role in China's growth, the country remains one of the world's top exporters and enjoys a sizable merchandise trade surplus. Brad Setser, a former White House economist in the Obama administration, said talk of a new era is premature.
""This is one possible future evolution of the global economy. It isn't necessarily the trajectory we're already on,"" he said.
The Chinese economy also has slowed from its double-digit growth pace of earlier this decade, and many business executives doubt President Xi Jinping's commitment to further market-oriented reforms. China faces a daunting corporate debt burden that some economists warn could spark a financial crisis and delay the onset of a new economic era.
The typical Chinese individual also still earns much less than an American. In terms of purchasing power parity, which takes account of each country's living costs, Chinese per-capita income is about $16,000, compared with roughly $60,000 in the United States.
Still, China has firmly established itself as a top opportunity â if not the top opportunity â for a wide range of American companies, including Apple, Walmart and Caterpillar. Over the past decade, per-person income in China has grown by 120 percent, compared with just 15 percent in the United States , according to Andy Rothman, an investment strategist with Matthews Asia in San Francisco.
""This is the world's best consumer story,"" Rothman said.
China's growing prosperity is part of a broader transformation of developing countries that is affecting the volume of goods traded across borders, the design of industry supply chains and the mix between factory labor and robots.
By 2030, fast-growing developing countries led by China are expected to account for 51 percent of global consumption, nearly double their 2007 share, according to a study by McKinsey Global Institute.
Companies in the advanced economies, including the United States , the European Union and Japan, last year sold $4.5 trillion worth of goods, including machinery, chemicals and cars, to customers in poorer nations.
""This is exactly the wrong time to be putting up barriers to trade,"" said Susan Lund, a McKinsey partner who directed the study.
In recent years, China accounted for more than one-third of global economic growth â roughly equal to the combined contributions of the United States, Europe and Japan, according to the International Monetary Fund.
For General Motors, that translated into deliveries of 3.65 million vehicles last year to Chinese buyers, compared with fewer than 3 million to Americans. The automaker earned $2 billion last year from its joint ventures in China.
""We posted the highest global sales mark in Cadillac's 116-year history of 382,184 units, primarily on the strength of our performance in China,"" Steve Carlisle, senior vice president of General Motors, told an investor conference last month.
U.S. multinationals that prosper overseas typically add jobs back home at their headquarters, research labs and design studios. Successful ventures like Cadillac's generate profits that flow to the corporate bottom line, generating job-creating innovations for Americans.
But those gains tilt toward investors and better-educated workers.
""The benefit of Chinese consumers buying more Cadillacs accrue more to shareholders and very high-skilled people. You'll see more of an unbalanced distribution of benefits,"" said Sergi Lanau, deputy chief economist for the Institute of International Finance.

"Trump Telecom Ban Takes Aim at China, Huawei; Executive order widely believed to be aimed at China's Huawei and ZTE","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2225328866?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTONâPresident Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that allows the U.S. to ban telecommunications network gear and services from foreign adversaries, taking aim at Chinese telecom companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. and dialing up security and trade tensions.
The order doesn't list any countries or companies by name. Instead, it gives the Commerce Secretary the authority to ban the import of gear or services from companies that have close ties to foreign governments and could use their equipment to monitor or disrupt U.S. telecommunications or other infrastructure.
U.S. national-security officials have contended that Chinese companies pose just such a threat, since under China's Communist Party rule they are obliged to abide by Beijing's orders.
""Regardless what the specific text says, the clear driving focus is China,"" said Peter Harrell, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
In addition to the executive order on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said it would add Huawei to a list of entities engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. interests. That could restrict sales or transfers of American technology to Huawei by requiring a government licenseâa potential body blow to the company, which relies on some U.S. tech companies for chips.
The Chinese embassy, Huawei and ZTE didn't immediately respond to requests for comment late Wednesday. But asked about the prospect of the executive order in Beijing earlier in the day, Huawei Executive Director David Wang said such a measure would be misguided.
""Globally, there are governments and experts that have confused this technological issue with political and ideological issues,"" Mr. Wang said. ""We think this ideological approach is not conducive to achieving cybersecurity, and labeling a company or country as a threat to security is not a good way going forward.""
The long-discussed order has been under active consideration for more than a year, but has been delayed by objections from rural U.S. telecommunications carriers.
These carriers, many of whom have built their networks on low-cost Chinese gear, have quietly raised concerns over the ban for months. The federal government and analysts estimate Chinese hardware makes up less than 1% of U.S. telecom networks, after Congress in 2012 effectively banned it from nationwide phone and internet providers.
But rural carriers have run up against pressure from national-security officials and lawmakers who have grown worried about any use of Chinese-made network gear in the U.S.
""Chinese telecom companies like Huawei effectively serve as an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party, and the administration is right to restrict the use of their products,"" said Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), a hawk on China who has pushed for more restrictions. ""Chinese components remain a Trojan horse for telecommunications infrastructure around the globe, and the Department of Commerce should deny their adoption entirely.""
Sen. Angus King (I., Maine) said in an interview that he hopes the order will help convince U.S. allies of the ""grave threat"" from potential Chinese espionage and sabotage.
The direct impact to Huawei and its smaller rival ZTE of the executive order isn't likely to be large. Despite growing into a global tech juggernaut in the past decade, both companies' U.S. footprint remains tiny.
The impact on rural carriers also could be blunted if the administration doesn't require them to rip out and replace existing gear. But some analysts poring over the order on Wednesday said its exact scope remained unclear. The order calls for an initial threat assessment within 40 days that could shed more lightâand raise pressure on China in the current bumpy trade talks.
In the order, Mr. Trump declared the threat to the U.S. from foreign adversaries a national emergency.
""President Trump is acting once again to protect U.S. national security. This Executive Order addresses the threat posed by foreign adversaries to the nation's information and communications technology and services supply chain,"" Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement. ""Under President Trump's leadership, Americans will be able to trust that our data and infrastructure are secure.""
Both Huawei and ZTE have been effectively blocked from selling their gear to major U.S. carriers since a 2012 congressional report deemed the companies a national-security threat. For Huawei, much of its U.S. revenue comes from sales of equipment and services to a handful of rural carriers. ZTE sells little equipment in the U.S.
Last year Huawei generated about $200 million in revenue from the U.S., just a fraction of the company's $107 billion in overall revenue. Of its more than 180,000 employees world-wide, about 1,200 work in the U.S., conducting research and development, managing customer relations, handling the company's massive procurement of U.S.-sourced components, and working in other business lines.
Despite a booming smartphone business that has lifted it to the world's second-largest handset vendorâbehind Samsung Electronics Co. and ahead of Apple Inc.âHuawei has no major-carrier partners in the U.S. through which to distribute its phones. It sells a small number of unlocked smartphones via online channels like Amazon.com, as well as laptops, wearable devices and other gadgets.
ZTE was once a major player in the U.S. smartphone market, with a market share as high as 15% in 2017, according to market researcher Canalys. But last year's U.S. order banning American companies from selling equipment to ZTE nearly vanquished the company, and its smartphone sales haven't recovered, falling to about 2% of the U.S. market last year. The order came after ZTE violated the terms of an agreement resolving violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.

"Tiananmen: The Crackdown That Defined Modern China; In the spring of 1989, a democratic future for China seemed possible. Then came Tiananmen. The U.S.-China relationship still hasn't recovered.","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2232415603?accountid=14586,"To stroll through Tiananmen Square that soft spring day in mid-May 1989 was to experience an atmosphere of excitement, hope and optimism unparalleled in recent Chinese history. Hundreds of thousands of idealistic demonstrators had flooded their country's most hallowed public space. What had catalyzed the immense, exuberant crowd was a spontaneous impulse to memorialize the April 15 death of Hu Yaobang, the former Communist Party General Secretary, who had been cashiered two years earlier for failing to suppress student demonstrations. Now this unexpected remembrance had morphed into the longest and largest mass protest in Chinese history .
To get a better view, I climbed up into an empty traffic kiosk in front of Mao's iconic portrait on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Stretching away to the east and west as far as the eye could see were two enormous rivers of bobbing heads and floating banners, surging joyously down the broad Avenue of Eternal Peace into Tiananmen Square. Besides students, there were families with children in strollers, Buddhist monks in robes, government bureaucrats in suits, laborers on heavy earth-moving equipment, elderly pensioners and even a gang of street hooligans with a placard reading, ""Don't Fight, Don't Make Trouble.""
The media, long under the strict control of the Central Propaganda Department, had also come to life for the first time in decades. Even the once-turgid People's Daily was not only accurately reporting each startling day's events but publishing ecstatic poetry, such as one verse that began: ""Standing at the edge of winter/ Looking forward to spring,/ I feel spring so close to me.""
China was indeed experiencing a springtime. At last, its halting tradition of democratic activism and cosmopolitan aspiration seemed on the verge of triumphing over the rival traditions of imperial rule and Leninism. Here was definitive proof that ideas of freedom were not just a foreign import or imposition. For the first time since 1949, one could suddenly imagine a China that was both more democratic and more fully integrated into the outside world.
But the moment didn't last, as we know in marking this week's melancholy 30th anniversary. Whatever the power of China's long-suppressed democratic hopes, they could not withstand the ideological determination and brutal might of the Chinese Communist Party. The crushing of the Tiananmen protest movement was a shock not just to all those intoxicated, idealistic Chinese demonstrators but also to Westerners like myself who believed that, with our help, China was starting to find its way to being a more modern and open society.
The tragedy of that possibly misplaced faith weighs especially heavily today. Under President Xi Jinping, a newly assertive authoritarian China now strikes many in the U.S. not just as a disappointment but as a threat. In retrospect, through the ups and downs of decades of diplomatic engagement and growing economic connection, the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989 now appears to be the moment when the regime most fully revealed the fundamental principles that now guide Mr. Xi and a rising China.
The Tiananmen demonstrations were hardly the first chapter in China's striving for greater political openness. A reform movement at the end of the last imperial dynasty had segued into Sun Yat-sen's short-lived constitutional republic in 1912. There had been the May 4th Movement of 1919, when mass protests erupted across the country in opposition to great-power imperialism and in support of ""science and democracy."" And in the 1930s, Chiang Kai-shek had presided over a seemingly promising ""Golden Era"" of stability and reform, brought to an end by Japanese occupation and World War II.
With the victory of Mao's communist revolution in 1949, China's democratic tradition was stifled. It didn't revive again until the late 1970s and '80s, when Deng Xiaoping's bold new agenda of ""reform and opening up"" brought not only radical market reforms in the state-controlled economy but a relaxation of political controls as well.
As protesters poured into Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989, the long-suppressed democratic hopes of the Chinese people were welling up again like a great lava vent. The square, the party's sanctum sanctorum, had been turned into a liberated zone, creating a heady, if naive, sense of invincibility among protesters. I watched as one father sat beside his hunger-striking daughter, daubing her brow with a cool cloth. ""My generation never dared speak out, much less to act out what we believed,"" he sobbed. ""Now my daughter's doing it for me."" A Peking University student told me, ""There's no way the party will ever get things back into the old bottle! Just look around us. History's sweeping them away!""
When a grim-faced Premier Li Peng appeared on television on May 19 to declare martial law, it was clear that a moment of reckoning was approaching. ""An extremely small handful of people who want to achieve their political goalâ¦are undermining the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,"" he intoned. The government had decided to ""take decisive and firm measures to put a swift end to the turmoil.""
To everyone's surprise, however, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered the city, hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded the streets to peacefully block their march to the square. As this putative ""people's army"" was stopped by the people themselves, protesters rejoiced by playing Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy.""
But even as they celebrated, a humiliated Deng was planning a second, more unyielding assault. On June 3, the loudspeakers around Tiananmen Square crackled to life, and an ominous voice thundered: ""For many days now, the Liberation Army has exercised restraint, but now it must resolutely counteract the rebellion.""
This time, with fresh columns of PLA troops brandishing automatic weapons and led by armored vehicles, not even the thousands of angry citizens who again rallied in the streets to throw up barricades could stop them. When dawn broke over the smoking wreckage on the morning of June 4, untold numbers had been killed and wounded. The seven-week-long protest movement had been crushed and, with it, the dream of a more democratic China.
The crackdown left the U.S. in a quandary unlike any it had faced since the Nixon-Kissinger breakthrough of 1972. At the heart of its still imperfectly formed relationship with the Communist regime was the expectation that China would continue to undergo economic and political reform, gradually becoming more congruent with the existing international order and better integrated into it. But political liberalization had now been dealt a decisive blow. Could the policy of engagement proceed on narrower grounds? Might China still find a place in the global economic order and perhaps even be goaded back toward a political system that allowed for more freedom of speech, individual rights and dissent? After all, as the U.S. policy establishment averred, were open markets not a sure path to more open societies?
In the decades after the Tiananmen crackdown, such rationales defined American policy. In the immediate wake of the June 1989 massacre, President George H.W. Bush, a Republican realist more concerned with the balance of power than human rights, bent over backward to keep channels open with Deng by sending his trusted national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, on a secret visit to Beijing. The decision to keep interacting with China, even as the memory of the massacre was still raw, was controversial, but Deng's rededication to economic reform soon afterward seemed to vindicate it.
Indeed, the commitment to continuing economic engagement became a bipartisan U.S. view. After deriding ""tyrants from Baghdad to Beijing,"" President Bill Clinton, the Democrat who defeated Bush in 1992, not only flip-flopped and approved permanent most-favored-nation trading status for Beijing but facilitated China's eventual entrance, in 2001, into the World Trade Organization. As President Clinton declared, admission to the WTO was the best way ""to integrate China further into the family of nations and secure our interests and ideals."" A more open trading relationship, he predicted, would advance reform in China and have ""a profound impact on human rights and liberty.""
Others were less starry-eyed about the move and simply saw China's acceptance into the WTO as good for business. In any event, the Chinese economic miracle in the years thereafter grew in no small measure from the American willingness to continue engaging with China, both diplomatically and economically.
President George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 declaring that trade was not only economically advantageous but capable of creating ""habits of liberty"" and ""expectations of democracy."" He too was a proponent of engagement, directing his Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, to set up a Strategic Economic Dialogue, a ""forum for discussing ways the United States and China can work together to address economic challenges and opportunities as responsible stakeholders in the international economic system.""
President Barack Obama also made a concerted effort to continue working with China, even after being received with notable coolness at a Beijing summit in 2009. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, sought to reassure the country's Communist leaders that while human-rights issues were important, it was also ""essential that the U.S. and China have a positive, cooperative relationship."" She cautioned against allowing such concerns to interfere with efforts to tackle ""the global economic crisis, the global climate-change crisis and the security crisis."" Indeed, every president since Nixon has tried to reassure Beijing that the U.S. has no intention of either ""containing"" China or preventing it from gaining its ""rightful place in the world.""
As for China's leaders themselves, they have never hinted at second thoughts about the fateful decisions of June 1989. Indeed, when the Soviet Union disintegrated two years later, the regime felt vindicated: The mistakes of Mikhail Gorbachev made it clear that communist states that opened up politically were simply signing their own death warrant.
Nor were they persuaded that U.S. intentions were benign in focusing so single-mindedly on China's economic integration into the world order. They sometimes reciprocated American rhetoric by adopting sympathetic policies, with soothing slogans such as ""peaceful rise,"" suggesting that a wealthier, more powerful China need not be aggressive or disruptive. Such signals allowed Western proponents of engagement to stick to the idea that both China and the U.S. would only benefit from deeper ties. At the same time, however, the party kept alive official rhetoric about the U.S. being a ""hostile foreign force"" and continued reviling the notion of China's ""peaceful evolution"" as a Western plot to undermine communism.
In hindsight, the crushing of the 1989 democracy movement was a clear indication that China's leadership understood and rejected the cost of moving onto ""the right side of history"" (to borrow President Clinton's Panglossian term) and joining the U.S.-dominated global order. For Americans, it was a beguiling dream and expressed a genuine desire to work things out between the two countries without provoking conflict. But it was a hope that too often overlooked just how antithetical the two countries' systems, values and perceptions of their national interests actually remained.
The limits of such wishful thinking have become more obvious since 2012, when Xi Jinping began his ascent to the top of the Chinese leadership. With his new Big Leader cult, disdain for democracy, authoritarian zeal and repudiation of political reform, Mr. Xi has prompted a far-reaching reconsideration among U.S. foreign policy elites, including second thoughts about the wisdom of the policy of engagement itself. Indeed, his policiesâexpanded party control over the economy, heightened state censorship, persecution of minorities (especially the Uighurs and the Tibetans) and a more assertive military posture in ""core interest"" areas of the South and East China Seas and the Taiwan Straitsâleave no doubt that the U.S. and China have widely divergent interests and aims for the global order.
For the roots of today's impasse and increasing hostility, we must look back to the crackdown of 1989 and its aftermath. Both the uprising in Tiananmen Square and the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union led Deng and other hard-line Chinese leaders to conclude that democratization and even some forms of economic reform were direct threats to one-party rule. As both sorts of reform have lagged in China, it has become harder for any American to make the case that China and the U.S. are still coming together, even slowly. And without some kind of convergence, ""engagement"" as a policy becomes futile.
Today's trade problemsâwith President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Mr. Xi's increasingly resistant Chinaâare just one small expression of a far wider and less tractable clash of systems and values. This antagonism is the logical and inevitable result of China's assertively autocratic policies over the past 30 years. If things continue to unravel, which seems likely, both Chinese and Americans may well look back on Deng's bold, pragmatic reforms of the 1980s with a wistful sense of opportunity lost and on the suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations as a pathway foreclosed.

China's Effort to Erase the June 4th Protests From History"
"REVIEW --- 30 Years After Tiananmen: The Crackdown That Defined Modern China --- In the spring of 1989, a democratic future for China seemed possible. Then came Tiananmen. The U.S.- China relationship still hasn't recovered.","Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2233027376?accountid=14586,"To stroll through Tiananmen Square that soft spring day in mid-May 1989 was to experience an atmosphere of excitement, hope and optimism unparalleled in recent Chinese history. Hundreds of thousands of idealistic demonstrators had flooded their country's most hallowed public space. What had catalyzed the immense, exuberant crowd was a spontaneous impulse to memorialize the April 15 death of Hu Yaobang, the former Communist Party General Secretary, who had been cashiered two years earlier for failing to suppress student demonstrations. Now this unexpected remembrance had morphed into the longest and largest mass protest in Chinese history.
To get a better view, I climbed up into an empty traffic kiosk in front of Mao's iconic portrait on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Stretching away to the east and west as far as the eye could see were two enormous rivers of bobbing heads and floating banners, surging joyously down the broad Avenue of Eternal Peace into Tiananmen Square. Besides students, there were families with children in strollers, Buddhist monks in robes, government bureaucrats in suits, laborers on heavy earth-moving equipment, elderly pensioners and even a gang of street hooligans with a placard reading, ""Don't Fight, Don't Make Trouble.""

U.S. Says China Misrepresented Why Trade Talks Broke Down; Treasury and U.S. Trade Representative say Washington positions have been 'consistent' while China 'back-pedaled',"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest .com/docview/2234234982?accountid=14586,"The Trump administration on Monday rebuked China for making statements in recent weeks that it said misrepresented why trade talks between the two nations reached an impasse.
Chinese officials, in public remarks and in a policy paper issued over the weekend, have chosen ""to pursue a blame game misrepresenting the nature and history of trade negotiations between the two countries,"" said the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Treasury Department in a joint statement. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have led Washington's negotiations with Beijing .
On Sunday, China released a government policy paper that said Washington had scuttled the negotiations, which reached an impasse in May, and said that China wouldn't shy away from a trade conflict.
The U.S. response to China's policy statement suggests the two sides remain far apart after talks broke down amid accusations from both sides. And yet, the U.S. statement included no mention of new demands, instead reiterating existing calls for China to address what it says are unfair trade practices such as forced technology transfer or intellectual property theft.
The U.S. statement, coming just weeks before a meeting of the heads of the Group of 20 major economies in Tokyo at the end of June, said Washington's ""negotiating positions have been consistent throughout these talks, and China back-pedaled on important elements of what the parties had agreed to.""
Chinese officials over the weekend stressed that, despite blaming the U.S. for the breakdown, they were willing to return to negotiations. Both sides have indicated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may meet on the sidelines of a G-20 summit.
Since talks began in November, the U.S. and Beijing have made statements that they wouldn't negotiate in public. But China, over the weekend, said publicly that U.S. demands were infringing on Chinese sovereignty.
The U.S. said in its statement that one of its key positions ""was the need for enforceability, a position necessitated by China's history of making commitments that it fails to keep.""
""But our insistence on detailed and enforceable commitments from the Chinese in no way constitutes a threat to Chinese sovereignty,"" the U.S. statement said.

"Will China's Tech Titans Be Heavyweights or Overweights? China's need for new technology champions is at the heart of the conflict with the U.S., but problems at home could be just as big a threat","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2234966036?accountid=14586,"China's path to technological supremacy has put companies such as Huawei in the Trump administration's crosshairs , but China has even more burning issues in the long run.
If the country can produce more globally competitive champions like the giant telecom-equipment firm, then it has decent odds of keeping its rapid growth trajectory going, even with an aging labor force that will raise costs and burden public finances . If not, the next decade could witness a further sharp slowdown in growth.
Third in a Series
This series asks what may well be the most important economic question of our time. China stands at a crossroads, approaching income levels at which most countries experience a sharp growth slowdown as they can no longer rely on cheap labor. It may struggle to innovate without strong intellectual-property protection and a more efficient way of financing companies. The ball is in Beijing's court.
* China Could Lose Face, Get Rich From a Trade Deal
* For China, Getting Rich Is GloriousâGetting Old Isn't
President Trump and his allies think the success of Chinese homegrown technology champions such as Huawei and ZTE is mainly due to lavish state support and sometimes outright industrial espionage. Supporters say such companies succeed because, as with Apple, customers love their products.
The reality is more nuanced.
China does have a thriving information-technology sector and is beginning to notch successes in areas such as artificial intelligence. But it still hasn't produced many global technology titans outside network equipment. The country's huge, heavily protected internal market can incubate big companies, but it can also coddle them and encourage wasteâparticularly without an efficient financial system to make sure the best entrepreneurs have a fair shot.
The sheer amount of money being marshaled is impressive. China plans to invest more than $100 billion in its chip-making industry. Research and development as a percentage of China's gross domestic product is above 2%, up from 1.4% in 2006. That is more than, for example, the U.K. On a purchasing-power parity basis it spends more than the European Union or Japan.
And China's state-led technology drive has produced some notable successesâhigh-speed rail, for example. Lured by China's big market, German and Japanese companies transferred technology to Chinese counterparts that have built an extensive rail network and taken on projects abroad.
Such maneuvers, however, are getting more controversial as China's economic heft grows. They are also more difficult in concentrated industries such as memory chips or aerospace, where it is harder to play competitors off each other by demanding technology in return for market access.
China's state-led, brute-financial-force approach to fostering innovation has other clear downsides. Local companies pile into subsidized sectors such as robotics, electric vehicles or clean energy, while local governments do their best to shield local champions from competition. The result is often massive overcapacity , which sinks margins and makes innovation even harder. China's attempt to dominate solar panels is one clear example that resulted in enormous debts and poor investor returns, as some of the largest panel makers, including Suntech and LDK Solar, filed for bankruptcy. Such policies also risk prematurely picking winners among competing technologies.
Priming the pump with cash can work. South Korea and Taiwan have developed semiconductor champions such as Samsung Electronics partly by showering state money on the industry. But such companies were also directly exposed to the discipline of the global export market since their domestic markets weren't large enough to feed them on their own. Chinese phone makers including Huawei and Xiaomi now ship around 40% of smartphones globally because they design phones that consumers actually want to buy .
In contrast, companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu have grown up feeding on the huge Chinese marketâwell protected from foreign competitorsâbut haven't really gone big outside China. That suggests that ""indigenous innovation,"" banking solely on China's big domestic market to produce global tech leaders, is a risky strategy.
Chinese intellectual property enforcement also remains a weakness. It has made meaningful changes to regulations and stepped up enforcement efforts in recent years but still leaves much to be desired in areas such as technology transfers and licensing. Last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce still ranked China 25th out of 50 countries in intellectual-property protection, behind the likes of Malaysia and Morocco, even though its scores have improved steadily since 2012, when the ranking first came out.
It would be a mistake for President Trump and his political allies to assume that China can't innovate without stealing foreign technology. U.S. firms are starting to buy up Chinese software startups. The nation possesses abundant resources, both human and financial. It also, however, appears in some ways to be turning inward againâback toward Mao Zedong's ideal of self-reliance. That could be dangerous without a sufficiently competitive internal market to foster innovation and a politicized financial system that tries, and often fails, to back winners.
Chinese companies could be the next generation of global tech heavyweights. A more self-absorbed China without further financial and legal reforms, however, might end up producing more flabby giants than rock-hard contenders.

"Amid Polarization, Bipartisanship Emerges on China, Big Tech; Democrats and Republicans are more together than apart on trade with China and t ech regulation","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezprox y.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2237565218?accountid=14586,"In a time of almost paralyzing partisanship and polarization, it's easy to miss the fact that on two of the biggest issues in the national debate there isâbrace yourself for thisâactual bipartisanship.
The two big issues are trade with China and new regulation of big tech companies. On both subjects, the two parties are more together than apart, and the Trump administration and Congress are more in harmony than off-key.
That hardly means there is complete agreement, of course, but the disagreements tend more toward tactics and degree than basic approach. Perhaps that's a sign that really big threatsâand a Chinese government and tech giants both behaving badly strike many as real threatsâstill can unite people across the political spectrum.
On trade disputes with China, Republicans who were chafing at President Trump's threat to place tariffs on imports from Mexico are far more united behind his tariff-fueled confrontation with China . More surprising, so too are Democrats.
The personification of this bipartisanship is Sen. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate. He and Mr. Trump, New Yorkers who know each other all too well, are waging a kind of sniper's war on most subjectsâbut not on trade with China.
When Mr. Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese products early last month, Mr. Schumer tweeted: ""Hang tough on China, President (Trump). Don't back down. Strength is the only way to win with China."" Mr. Schumer sometimes sounds almost Trumpian when referring to Chinese trade practices, calling them ""predatory"" and saying Beijing is an ""unfair competitor"" that ""bends and breaks rules.""
Other Democrats are less vocal but share the sentiment. Democrats' biggest problem with Mr. Trump's approach is more tactical than strategic: They think he was crazy to start trade fights with Canada, Mexico, South Korea and the European Union before engaging China. Theyâalong with many Republicansâare urging him to settle the fights with allies to create a united front in dealing with China.
The bipartisanship may come with an expiration date. If the battle drags on, and consumers and manufacturers as well as farm exporters suffer prolonged pain, support for the president's approach could crumble. For now, though, he has bipartisan cover.
On tech policy, the tendency toward bipartisanship is showing up regularly . Just last week, as the Trump administration's Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission began probing anticompetitive behavior by Google and Facebook, the Democrats running the House Judiciary Committee announced they were launching their own inquiry into competition in digital markets. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the committee chairman, cited ""growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control of key arteries of online commerce, content and communications.""
A leading congressional skeptic of the big tech companies is a conservative Republican senator from the Midwest, Josh Hawley of Missouri. He has introduced legislation to compel tech companies to do more to protect consumer privacy, and, in a letter to the FTC this spring, argued that concerns about the big social-media platforms ""cross party lines"" and ""include a central, shared concern that the new custodians of once-diffuse information have abused the power they amassed and neglected their responsibilities.""
Meantime, one of the House's more liberal members, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, is attempting to compose a kind of bill of rights for internet users. He is working with both the House's top Democrat, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and its top Republican, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, on tech issues.
In an interview, Rep. Khanna said he and Rep. McCarthy are composing legislation to create a consortium of big media companies that would work together to prevent foreign interference on their platforms, in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Companies that share information in an attempt to prevent foreign meddling would in turn get help from federal law-enforcement agencies.
Rep. Khanna says he also supports ""well-crafted privacy regulations"" on tech companies. The consensus on regulation has limits, of course. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up big tech companies. By contrast, Rep. Khanna warns that in addressing antitrust issues, ""we don't want a sledgehammer. We need a scalpel."" He calls for a ""thoughtful"" approach that prevents the big search and social-media firms from taking advantage of their power without so hobbling them that the door is opened for Chinese companies to become dominant.
But Rep. Khanna thinks there is room for a big bipartisan consensus on what might be the most important tech issue of all: making sure all Americans, regardless of geography or income, have the skills and access to technology needed in the information economy. ""If you want America to win over China, double down on all the technology,"" he says. ""I don't think that's a partisan issue.""

"Juice for China's Economy Is Coming; China's economic data for May was bad, aligning the stars for more aggressive stimulus from Beijing","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2239615289?accountid=14586,"China's May economic data confirmed what earlier trade and business surveys had already hinted at: China is at risk of a substantial slowdown after an apparent improvement in growth prospects early this year. Further monetary and fiscal support is all but inevitable.
Growth data in early 2019 was heavily distorted by one-off factors , including a big tax cut, which made things look better than they really were. Even accounting for that, May data released Friday points toward further deterioration. Worst of all, the impact on credit growth of ructions in China's money markets since regulators' unexpected
takeover of a small bank in late May won't be apparent until next month's data at the earliest.
The most worrying part of Friday's data release was the signal on heavy industry. Real estate and construction have been the backbone holding up the economy this year as exports and the labor market have been pummeled. Now, housing investment and production of key construction inputs such as crude steel, glass, electricity and nonferrous metals are all weakening.
Electricity production grew just 0.2% on the year in May, its slowest rate since 2016. Output of nonferrous metals such as aluminum and copper grew at their slowest pace since last June. And real-estate investment dipped sharply, with 9.5% growth on the year in May down from nearly 12% in April.
This comes on top of other worrying signs for the construction sector. Credit growth, which rebounded strongly early in the year as panicked policy makers dialed back their crackdown on shadow banking, has more or less trended sideways since March. Imports of industrial commodities including iron ore, copper and crude oil have weakened.
Investment, imports and production all slowing at the same time is an ominous sign. Drooping producer-price inflation points to weak demand as well. Headline consumer price inflation is rapid thanks to the swine fever that is decimating China's pig population. But core inflation, excluding food and energy, is at its weakest since 2016. The central bank is likely to look through the high headline number at shaky overall consumer demand and modest price pressure outside food.
On Thursday, Vice Premier Liu He, China's economic czar, said regulators should step up support for the economy and keep liquidity ample. Investors should take him at his word. Weak growth and shaky banks are, for now, more urgent problems than a falling yuan and mounting debt. More juice for the economy is coming soon.

China Cracks Down on Canadian Pork; Customs agents in China are said to have found traces of feed additive in shipment of frozen pork,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.pr oquest.com/docview/2242178224?accountid=14586,"OTTAWAâCanada said Tuesday China has banned imports from a Canadian pork company, weeks after Canadian officials warned the meat industry of heightened Chinese scrutiny of its products amid a broader diplomatic row between Ottawa and Beijing.
A spokeswoman for Canada's Agriculture Minister, Marie-Claude Bibeau, said Canadian diplomats in Beijing were informed last week of the temporary suspension of pork imports from a Quebec processor, Frigo Royal. Customs agents in China are said to have found traces of a feed additive, ractopamine, in a shipment of frozen pork. Ractopamine is banned in China, the spokeswoman said, although allowed for use by Canadian food-safety authorities.
A representative from China's embassy in Ottawa said late Tuesday that China had suspended imports from a Canadian company after ractopamine was found during an inspection. ""We hope that the Canadian side will attach great importance to it, thoroughly investigate the cause of the problem and take effective measures to ensure the safety of meat products exported to China,"" the embassy representative said in an e-mail.
This isn't the first time Canadian pork exports were targeted by China. About a month ago, Chinese authorities suspended imports from two Canadian pork plants over what Canadian officials and the pork industry have characterized as an administrative issue.
The Canadian minister's spokeswoman said the export of other Canadian meat products to China continue without issues. A person at Frigo Royal, based in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, declined to comment when reached by phone.
Earlier this month, Canada warned domestic meat producers and processors to be extra vigilant after Chinese officials signaled they would intensify inspections, following cases of improper labeling on some pork imports. The stepped up scrutiny comes at a time of heightened tension between Canada and China, after Canadian authorities detained last December a senior Huawei Technologies Co. executive at the behest of the U.S. Shortly after the arrest, China detained, and later charged, two Canadians on national-security grounds. Canadian officials have called for China to release the two Canadian men.
China also stopped buying Canadian canola seed in March, and stepped up inspections of other agrifood products, such as soybeans. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has linked some of these economic restrictions to the broader trade and geopolitical dispute between the U.S. and China.

How China Treats a Friend; Duterte kowtows as Beijing bullies Manila in the South China Sea.,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2243087452?accountid=14586,"The ramming of a Filipino fishing boat by a Chinese vessel last week marked an escalation in the South China Sea. But you wouldn't know it listening to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has become exhibit A for the folly of appeasing Beijing's geopolitical ambitions.
A Chinese fishing boat struck the F/B Gimver 1 on the edge of the Spratly Islands, which Beijing claims as its territory, sinking the ship and leaving 22 Filipino fishermen stranded at sea before they were picked up by a Vietnamese vessel. The Chinese deny the collision was intentional, but Philippine Navy Vice Admiral Robert Empedrad said ""the ship was rammed"" and anchored at the time. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana also condemned the Chinese action.
Enter Mr. Duterte, who on Monday downplayed the collision as ""a little maritime accident"" and called for an investigation, according to the Philippine Star. ""The only thing we can do,"" he said, ""is to wait and give the other party the right to be heard.""
Wait for what? Mr. Duterte has bowed before Chinese aggression for three years. After his election in 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled that China's claims to nearly the entire South China Seaâincluding the Spratly archipelagoâviolated international law. But Mr. Duterte ignored the ruling, gambling that appeasement would minimize conflict and boost economic ties.
That bet soured as China has since placed advanced antiship and anti-aircraft artillery on its Spratly Islands bases, which also host ports and airfields. Earlier this year Philippine media reported the Chinese effectively wrested control of Thitu Island, located in the Spratlys, from Philippine fishermen using paramilitary vessels.
Such naval militia often pose as fishing boats, which may explain last week's collision. The Pentagon's 2019 report on the Chinese military found that Beijing uses these opaque tactics as ""an effective means of accomplishing political objectives."" China's southern island province of Hainan ordered ""the building of 84 large militia fishing vessels with reinforced hulls and ammunition storage"" which were delivered in 2016, says the report.
Beijing's usurpations are being challenged by the U.S. The Trump Administration has increased freedom of navigation operations through the disputed waters, and the U.K., France and other allies have joined.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed in February that an armed attack against Philippine forces in the South China Sea would trigger defense obligations under the U.S.-Philippine mutual defense treaty. This is meant to deter Chinese adventurism and is a welcome change from Barack Obama's appeals to Beijing's better angels.
Mr. Duterte's latest kowtow undercuts Washington's message. The Philippine President often remarks that resisting Beijing would be futile or invite war. But the U.S. is offering a united front against Chinese incursions, which would make conflict less likely. Chinese President Xi Jinping in April praised Mr. Duterte as a ""true friend,"" but 22 Filipino fishermen now know what that is worth."
"Canada Probes Fake Export Certificates Amid Dispute With China; All China-bound meat shipments are halted, in blow to Canadian farmers","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2247037948?accountid=14586,"OTTAWAâCanada's Trade Minister Jim Carr vowed Wednesday to find out the source of fake Canadian export certificates, saying this alleged criminal activity represents another blow to Canadian farmers who have become collateral damage in a deepening row between Beijing and Ottawa.
The emergence of forged export documents forced Canada late Tuesday to heed Beijing's request to halt all China-bound meat shipments, which last year totaled nearly a half-billion U.S. dollars.
""There is somebody out there who is falsifying Canadian export certificates because they think it is in their interest to do it. It's criminal, and we will get to the bottom of it,"" Mr. Carr told Canada's CTV Television Network. ""We want to normalize exports to China as soon as possible.""
The possibility of alleged criminal activity in the export of China-bound goods from Canada is the latest development in a deepening economic and diplomatic dispute between the two nations, triggered after Canadian authorities last December detained a senior executive from Huawei Technologies Co. After Meng Wanzhou was arrested, China detained and arrested two Canadian men on national-security grounds, banned the import of Canada canola seed , and ramped up scrutiny of Canadian agriculture imports. China is Canada's second-largest export market for agricultural products.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland have failed to speak with their Chinese counterparts in an effort to resolve the dispute.
The decision to halt all China-bound meat exports came after Chinese officials last week banned pork products from a third Canadian meat processor due to a banned substance discovered in the inspection process. Previous bans on certain pork products were linked to labeling errors. In the most recent case, customs agents in China are said to have found traces of a feed additive, ractopamine, in a shipment of frozen pork from a Quebec-based processor. Ractopamine is banned in China, although allowed for use in some other countries.
An ensuing Canadian probe discovered the use of forged export certificates, which Chinese officials described as ""obvious safety loopholes"" in Canadian inspections of export-bound meat.
Mr. Carr said officials are now uncertain as to where the frozen pork with ractopamine originated. He added that food-safety inspectors in Canada would never have allowed the pork shipment to head to China had they known about the feed additive. ""We will try to get the right answer,"" he said.
The investigation involves food-safety and law-enforcement officials, Mr. Carr said. A spokeswoman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police declined to comment.
Representatives for the Chinese embassy in Ottawa didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, including what would be required before Canadian meat can re-enter China.
The Canadian Meat Council, which represents meatpackers and processors, said it was worried about the financial loss the industry faces from this China setback, but would try to secure new markets in the meantime. Last year, Canadians shipped over 500 million Canadian dollars ($379 million) of pork to China, and nearly C$100 million in beef.

Trump's Most Powerful Weapon in the U.S.-China Trade Fight; China's banks would be defenseless if the U.S. weaponized the dollar,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2247596316?accountid=14586,"A U.S. judge found three unnamed Chinese banks to be in contempt of court in April, according to recently unsealed documents from the District Court for the District of Columbia. This could add a dangerous new element to the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.
The ruling, relating to the banks' failure to comply with subpoenas issued a year-and-a-half ago, mandates a fine of $50,000 a day for each bank. But this penalty may not be the lenders' biggest problem. The case also opens up the possibility of sanctions that would lock them out of the international system of dollar transactions, as Iran has been .
It will be up to the heads of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Justice Department, not the courts themselves, to decide whether to proceed with such constraints. That makes it a valuable political weapon for President Trump. Crucially, it is one for which China has no equivalent.
According to reporting by the Washington Post, the ruling aligns with a 2017 DoJ filing against China Merchants Bank, Bank of Communications and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank for breach of sanctions against North Korea. The three banks denied involvement in any investigations related to U.S. sanctions.
In extremis, the credit line from the People's Bank of China that would be required to guarantee all liabilities not covered by liquid assets for those three banks would run to $175 billion, according to Credit Suisse analysts. At roughly 6% of the country's official currency reserves, that number would be large but manageable.
Still, the case of Baoshang Bank, a relative minnow, should give investors pause. The public takeover of the troubled northern Chinese lender has sent ripples through the country's money market as investors have worried about potential write-downs.
The specific institutions involved in the DoJ case may matter less than the precedent that any further action would set. China has no equivalent mechanism to retaliate against U.S. banks, which don't really need access to yuan-denominated trading and settlement.
For all the heated discussion about internationalizing China's currency, a real role for the yuan in global finance remains a pipe dream. In May, it made up 1.95% of cross-border currency transactions processed on Swift, from 2.12% four years earlier. Even those figures are magnified several times over by treating Hong Kong as a separate jurisdiction. Removing the semiautonomous region from the statistics would give the yuan an international share just south of the Polish zloty's 0.53%.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, about $107 billion in yuan-denominated bonds have been issued in international marketsâso excluding Chinese companies issuing in China. That figure is less than 1% of the $11.3 trillion in dollar debt raised across borders.
Beijing and Washington can go tit for tat on trade and tech. But in international finance the two sides are grossly mismatched. The U.S. government is the final arbiter of a dollar system to which Chinese banks need access.

"China Knows What It Wantsâthe U.S. Still Doesn't; China, prioritizing Huawei, focuses on long-term growth while U.S. endgame is muddy","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2251017536?accountid=14586,"In its trade negotiations with China, the U.S. should have all the leverage. It buys far more from China than vice versa, is sole supplier of numerous critical technologies and commands more loyalty from the rest of the world.
But China brings one powerful advantage of its own: clarity of purpose. Though its negotiating priorities change, over the decades its goal has remained the same: moving steadily up the development ladder while remaining a one-party state. The U.S. ban on supplying key inputs to Huawei Technologies Co. was an existential threat to the next stage in that development, competing globally in the world's most advanced technologies. Thus, when President Xi Jinping met President Trump on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, this past weekend, his main condition for restarting negotiations was to lift the ban.
U.S. leaders, for their part, have long been divided over whether to treat China as a partner that can be managed or a rival that must be ostracized. The Trump administration is itself split, and the president's decision to give Huawei a temporary reprieve has left the endgame as muddy as ever.
Share Your Thoughts
What should the U.S. prioritize in its trade negotiations with China? Join the conversation below.
China joined the World Trade Organization back in 2001 as a way to discipline its inefficient state-owned enterprises, secure access to foreign markets, and stoke export-led growth. Along with an undervalued Chinese currency, WTO membership attracted a flood of foreign capital and expertise that turned China into the world's factory floor.
That led to widening Chinese trade surpluses and deepening friction with the U.S. Beijing addressed those tensions by letting its currency, the yuan, rise in value. Its priorities then shifted from attracting foreign investment and export-led growth to cultivating domestic champions. So even as China's trade surplus began shrinking as a share of national output, Western companies faced tightened access to the Chinese market and pressure to transfer technology and know-how to Chinese rivals.
China is now embroiled in a tariff war over U.S. efforts to end that discriminatory treatment. Yet its priorities have again evolved, from protecting domestic champions at home to nurturing global champions in the most advanced industries, from energy-efficient cars to artificial intelligence.
""The Chinese are still highly protective of their domestic market, but what they identify as most worthy of protection has changed over time and moved up market as their ambitions in technology have expanded,"" says Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Huawei isn't just any company; it is the leading supplier in arguably the world's most important technology, fifth-generation telecommunications networks, and a considerable source of national pride.
Huawei and state-owned ZTE Corp. and State Grid, the electricity monopoly, are strategic ""tools to push China up the tech ladder,"" says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute. ""They're at the heart of [Xi's] approach to China's development.""
The U.S. campaign against Huawei began as a national security matter based on the company's potential to become a conduit for Chinese government spying. It is now integral to the broader debate over how to treat China.
American leaders thought WTO accession would strengthen the rule of law in China while encouraging economic and political liberalization. By the end of the Obama administration those hopes had been dashed, and the Trump administration has repudiated that view altogether. Yet it has yet to settle on an alternative, and Huawei symbolizes the divide.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has long argued China has exploited the WTO to run huge trade surpluses, steal intellectual property, coerce foreign companies into transferring their technology, and subsidize domestic firms. Yet he also believes China can be made to behave with an alternative set of rules, and sees Huawei as an unrelated national security issue.
By contrast, the hawks close to Mr. Trump believe China's system is fundamentally incompatible with that of the U.S. and its allies. To them, blacklisting Huawei potentially matters more than tariffs in keeping China from displacing the U.S. economically and militarily. ""This radical cadre of the Chinese Communist party has been running against the West for 15 or 20 years,"" one of those hawks, former adviser Steve Bannon, told CNBC last week. ""Huawei is a dirty bomb inside industrial democracies."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier this year accused China of wanting to ""divide Western alliances through bits and bytes, not bullets and bombs.""
Yet Mr. Trump subscribes to neither of these world views. He judges China by the same transactional metrics he judges all countries: deficits, dollars and Dow points. On Saturday, explaining the Huawei reprieve, he said: ""We sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product."" He also justified his decision a year earlier to suspend a ban on selling to ZTE at Mr. Xi's personal request because they paid the U.S. a steep fine and ""they also have to buy American product. Buying American product is very important to me.""
Successful negotiation depends on knowing your own bottom line. That is something the U.S. still appears to be figuring out.

"Heavy Debt Humbles China's Business Champions, Including the Jewelry Queen; China's economic slowdown has exposed how some of the country's biggest private companies are struggling to manage excessive debt","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2253295657?accountid=14586,"Neoglory Place mall, near Yiwu, has few customers and most shops have closed. PHOTO: James T. Areddy/The Wall Street Journal
YIWU, ChinaâWhen she was a teenager in the 1970s, Zhou Xiaoguang peddled trinkets city to city and slept on trains, a formative chapter in her creation of the world's largest costume jeweler, Neoglory Holdings Group Co.
Leveraging her empire of baubles, China's ""fashion-accessory queen"" added hotels, offices and malls. The magnate took a seat in China's national parliament, accepted business accolades, including Ernst & Young's ""Entrepreneur of the Year,"" and erected the tallest skyscraper in Yiwu, a trading city south of Shanghai.
Now, China's economic slowdown is making Ms. Zhou known for something else: her billions of dollars in debt. A bankruptcy court in April said Neoglory ""is unable to repay a due debt, has insufficient assets for repaying all its debts and is apparently insolvent.""
Ms. Zhou's turn of fortune is part of a reckoning that is ensnaring many of the star entrepreneurs who produced China's great economic boom.
For a generation, China's explosive growth rewarded bold expansion, and many borrowed heavily to seize the moment. Shanghai wealth-tracking service Hurun Report said China minted four billionaires a week in 2018 and is No. 1 globally in self-made fortunes.
Full-steam growth also masked companies' strategic mistakesâin addition to excessive debt, many overexpanded into unfamiliar and crowded business sectors. These problems are becoming increasingly apparent as China's economy slows to its weakest growth in more than 25 years . The companies' struggles foretell a further drag on the expansion.
In the past decade, China's overall debt quadrupled , to around three times the value of last year's national output. Corporate debt accounts for two-thirds of the total, or more than $26 trillion last year, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Government-run companies owe most of that money, but signs of distress are appearing most dramatically at private companies, which have less pull with creditors and less support under President Xi Jinping, who sees the state sector as the economy's mainstay.
China's onetime soybean king and formerly the richest man in prosperous Shandong province, Shao Zhongyi, said his Chenxi Group was felled last year by lenders who suddenly called in loans in what he termed a ""high-speed bleed."" Early in that year, industrial machine maker Zhejiang Jindun Group's founder leapt to his death, leading the company to reveal in a stock exchange notice that it owed over 9.9 billion yuan, or about $1.4 billion, some to loan sharks."
You Canât Force People to Assimilate. So Why Is China at It Again?,New York Times (Online); New York,2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2258018089?accountid=14586,"The Chinese governmentâs campaign of internment in the northwestern region of Xinjiang is extraordinary, by dint of its scale â but also, its contradictions.
Up to 1.5 million people from predominantly Muslim Turkic minorities â Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz â have been arbitrarily detained in political re-education camps designed in part to make them renounce their religious beliefs.
At times, the Chinese authorities have portrayed this mass detention campaign as a âstrict preventative measureâ against violent extremist ideologies. At others, they have called it a benign âvocational trainingâ initiative, comparing detainees to âboarding school students.â
But eyewitnesses â as well as the governmentâs own documents â reveal that these facilities are prisonlike internment camps that rely on intensive brainwashing procedures and forms of psychological torture. (There also have been reports of physical torture and rape.) Beyond the camps, the stateâs social re-engineering efforts involve systematically separating children from their parents and enlisting more and more adults in forms of forced labor.
Although China has occasionally faced violent resistance from some Uighur groups, notably terrorist attacks in Beijing in 2013 and Kunming in 2014, the re-education campaign in Xinjiang isnât really about combating extremism. (The United Statesâ antiterrorism czar, Nathan Sales, said as much earlier this month.) Those detained arenât just young men â the group most vulnerable to radicalization, it is thought â but also the elderly and pregnant women, as well as atheists and converts to Christianity. One can be interned for putting too much gas in oneâs car, refusing to smoke in public (abstention is taken to be a sign of piety) or receiving phone calls from relatives overseas. Members of ethnic minorities who said that they had tried everything to become âmodel Chinese citizensâ have reported that those efforts didnât save them from internment.
Why not? And why is the Chinese government repressing entire ethnic groups when such heavy-handed tactics are likely to only promote resistance and radicalization? And why is it willing to risk alienating Muslim governments in Central Asia and beyond even as President Xi Jinping has made the grand Belt and Road Initiative his flagship international project?
Because the Chinese Communist Party cannot not try to coerce assimilation. Its ultimate goal in Xinjiang â as elsewhere in China â is to exercise complete ideological supremacy, and that also entails trying to transform the very identity of the countryâs minorities. The C.C.P. lives in perennial fear that, short of having a complete grip on Chinese society, its long-term survival is in danger.
And so the C.C.P. is doubling down today on a campaign of forced assimilation in Xinjiang that has failed elsewhere in the past.
The partyâs current re-education drive is an upgraded version of the Cultural Revolution. This campaign, too, seeks to achieve ideological control by eradicating alternative ideological and belief systems. But it does so in a much more sophisticated and high-tech way. In Xinjiang, reams of personal information about Uighurs and other minorities are entered into police databases after being collected at checkpoints, through feeds from surveillance systems or during house visits.
Only this effort seems to ignore that one effect of the Cultural Revolution was to create a spiritual vacuum and that in the decades since China has experienced various spiritual revivals. Many Uighurs and Tibetans, as well as members of the Han majority, have ardently embraced both traditional and new beliefs.
The number of Christians in China is thought to have increased from 3.4 million in 1950 to about 100 million today â or more than the C.C.P.âs entire membership. Even C.C.P. members have either openly embraced a major religion or have anonymously admitted that they attend religious services, seek divination, burn incense or keep idols in their homes. Many of the devout see no contradiction between their faith and their patriotism or respect for the party.
Still, the C.C.P.âs campaign of assimilation today continues to target religion, because, in the partyâs eyes, religion, which tends to represent a personâs deepest allegiance, competes with loyalty to the state and undercuts the partyâs ideological foundation: materialism.
Chinaâs spiritual revival has thoroughly confounded the core Marxist assumption that economic development would naturally extinguish religious beliefs; in fact, it has occurred even as the country has been lifted out of poverty. Increasing wealth also seems to have fueled corruption, including within the C.C.P. â undermining the partyâs legitimacy and moral standing. The C.C.P. is now doubly on the ideological defensive.
The government, beyond targeting religion, has also tried to promote ethno-linguistic assimilation â again, through material incentives. Some minorities have pursued a Chinese language education in order to achieve upward social mobility. But many more have only become more entrenched in their distinct ethnic and religious identity.
Earlier this year, Tibetan nomads were told they could obtain state subsidies only if they replaced their altars devoted to Buddhist deities with images of Chinese political leaders. Likewise, Christian villagers in southeast China had previously been told to replace depictions of Jesus with portraits of President Xi if they wanted to continue to receive poverty-alleviation subsidies. Local officials then reportedly claimed, according to social media, that the initiative had successfully âmelted the hard iceâ in Christiansâ âheartsâ and âtransformed them from believing in religion to believing in the party.â
Had it, though? My research among Sinicized Tibetans, conducted between 2006 and 2008 in Qinghai Province, showed that even the more assimilated members of the group could become champions of the very ethnic identity they supposedly had renounced. A similar phenomenon seems to be occurring among Uighurs now.
To take one example: Mihrigul Tursun, a Uighur, told the United States Congress last year of her time in detention and compulsory Chinese-language education, âMy experience in this state program actually made me more conscious of my ethnic identity.â She has since become an outspoken activist.
An acquaintance of mine also said some Han Chinese in Xinjiang have told him that they believed the government was turning harmless minority citizens into hateful opponents â who will retaliate if they are ever released.
And yet the C.C.P. today has no choice but to believe that its re-education program can transform people into ideologically conforming citizens. Faced with the failure of more benign methods â improved living conditions, technological progress, state propaganda â it can only resort to repression.
Karl Marx predicted that capitalism would eventually collapse under the weight of its inherent contradictions. The C.C.P. seems no less vulnerable to its own contradictions: Its absolutist form of materialism, which aims to supplant religion and culture, has only intensified peopleâs yearning for religion and culture. Yet for now, it is desperately implementing its self-defeating ideology full throttle, and the effects in Xinjiang are devastating.

"China's State-Driven Growth Model Is Running Out of Gas; Latest data suggest China may not match the trajectory of Taiwan, South Korea and Japan","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2258739449?accountid=14586,"New data showing the toll trade tensions are taking on China's economy are merely a symptom of a more serious malaise: The country's state-led growth model is running out of gas. A recession or crisis may not be imminent, but the long-run implications are just as serious. Absent a change in direction, China may never become rich.
The economy's growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter , a near-three-decade low. That's still pretty good for a middle-income country with per-capita gross domestic product of $14,000 to $18,000 a year, depending on how Chinese data are adjusted for inflation, exchange rates and purchasing power. It's also the fastest among major economies.
Yet from a different perspective, it's far less impressive. First, official statistics probably paint too flattering a picture. Per-capita income may be a quarter lower than reported, based on a study of nighttime light co-authored by Yingyao Hu of Johns Hopkins University. Alternative data such as tax collections suggest growth was 1.8 points slower than reported from 2010 to 2016, Chang-Tai Hsieh of the University of Chicago and three co-authors conclude.
Second, it doesn't measure up to the economies China seeks to emulate. Taiwan, South Korea and Japan all opened their economies to global trade and investment, enjoyed superfast growth for several decades, then slowed as they reached middle-income statusâthe early 1970s for Japan, the 1980s and early 1990s for Taiwan and South Korea. In theory, China should be able to sustain rapid growth even longer because rich countries such as the U.S. have pushed the technological frontier out further, offering more room for China to catch up.
In fact, China seems to be slowing sooner than the others. After reaching levels comparable to China today, Taiwan's per-capita income grew 7.5% for another decade, South Korea 6.3% and Japan 4.7%. Yet for China it will be ""very difficult to sustain rates of growth above 4% under the current policy environment,"" says Loren Brandt, an expert on Chinese growth at the University of Toronto.
Share Your Thoughts
What should China do to sustain its growth rate? Join the conversation below.
Some of the reasons are immutable. China's working-age population has stopped growing. The big shift of labor from rural farms to urban factories is largely complete. And Andrew Tilton, economist at Goldman Sachs, notes China can no longer rely on exports as much as smaller countries because of its size: It has saturated foreign markets and generated a protectionist backlash.
China may also pay a penalty for its current growth model. For 30 years the Communist Party opened ever more of the economy to private enterprise, trade, foreign investment and market forces. Yet it never relinquished its commitment to socialism and Mr. Brandt says that since the mid-2000s the government has tightened control over sectors it considers militarily or economically strategic, such as telecommunications. Some Chinese officials ""truly believe a dominant state sector is exactly what China needs to become globally and strategically important.""
China today differs in significant ways from Taiwan, South Korea and Japan at similar stages of development. One is that infrastructure, most of it state-led, and housing, are much more important in China, representing half of total investment, says Dwight Perkins, a China expert at Harvard University. This made sense when the average family's apartment was just 200 square feet and even its most densely populated regions lacked freeways. Now, though, the average apartment is 800 feet, and new highways and railroads increasingly serve remote areas with less potential payoff. ""It's good for those areas, but the return on that investment has undoubtedly fallen very sharply.""
Another difference is China's reliance on debt, which, according to Mr. Tilton, is, as a share of GDP, two to four times that of its east Asian peers at similar stages of development. The upshot: China invests just as heavily but far less efficiently than its peers did. It shows: The return on capital plummeted from 19% in 2007 to 8.4% in 2017, according to Andrew Batson of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research service. The China Development Research Foundation, a government think tank, says total-factor productivity, which measures how efficiently labor and capital are deployed, began growing faster in 2016 , led by services. But some analysts are skeptical of official data and say productivity growth has been negative for years.
An inefficient state sector matters less if the private sector grows fast enough. But in recent years, private firms in China have faced multiple headwinds. State-controlled banks prefer to lend to state-owned enterprises, so private firms borrow from less-regulated ""shadow banks,"" which the authorities have targeted in their crackdown on excess lending. The domestic private sector's share of total sales has dropped about 5 percentage points since 2016, according to Goldman, while the state sector's share has risen roughly as much.
The trade clash has also hurt the private firms, many foreign owned, that dominate exports while rallying nationalists to defend China's state-centric model. China still has many reformers pressing to expand the role of private enterprise. The top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, earlier this year denied the country owed its rapid growth to ""state monopoly capitalism,"" said foreign and private capital can enter almost any industry, and vowed to keep opening up the financial sector. Yet Mr. Batson says the trade confrontation could make it ""politically more and more difficult for people like Guo to both defend China's system against foreign attacks, and continue to nudge it in a different direction.""

Deal for Naval Outpost in Cambodia Furthers China's Quest for Military Network; Use of Ream naval base would help China's military project power across a broad swath of Southeast Asia,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2260628224?accountid=14586,"SIHANOUKVILLE, CambodiaâChina has signed a secret agreement allowing its armed forces to use a Cambodian navy base near here, as Beijing works to boost its ability to project military power around the globe, according to U.S. and allied officials familiar with the matter.
The pactâsigned this spring but not disclosed by either sideâgives China exclusive rights to part of a Cambodian naval installation on the Gulf of Thailand, not far from a large airport now being constructed by a Chinese company.
Some details of the final deal were unclear, the officials said, but an early draft, seen by U.S. officials, would allow China to use the base for 30 years, with automatic renewals every 10 years after that. China would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships, according to the draft.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you make of China establishing its first military outpost in Southeast Asia? Join the conversation below.
Military operations from the naval base, airport, or both, would sharply increase Beijing's capacity to enforce territorial claims and economic interests in the South China Sea , to threaten U.S. allies in Southeast Asia and to extend its influence over the strategically important Malacca Strait.
Chinese and Cambodian officials have denied there are any plans for a Chinese military base in the country. ""Nothing is happening like that,"" Phay Siphan, a Cambodian government spokesman, said on Friday. He called it ""fake news.""
U.S. and allied officials, however, said a deal had been done that, while stopping short of a full-scale Chinese base, would give Beijing its first dedicated naval staging facility in Southeast Asia and a second outpost in what the Pentagon sees as a Chinese quest for a global network of military and dual-use sites.
Washington is ""concerned that any steps by the Cambodian government to invite a foreign military presence in Cambodia"" would disturb regional peace and stability, said Emily Zeeberg, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh.
Surrounded by dense jungle and mangroves, and overlooked by a Buddhist temple, the naval installation in question, at Ream, covers about 190 acres and includes two facilities built with U.S. funding and used by the Cambodian navy, and a single pier where a dozen patrol craft dock.
According to the early draft of the base accord, China would build two new piersâone for Chinese use, one for Cambodian, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials said further dredging would likely be needed for the base to host larger Chinese navy ships.
The draft also allows China's personnel to carry weapons and Cambodian passports and requires Cambodians to get Chinese permission to enter the 62-acre Chinese section of Ream, U.S. officials said.
The U.S.-funded facilities at Ream are to be relocated to allow ""further infrastructure development and security enhancement,"" according to a July letter from Cambodia's defense ministry to the U.S. seen by The Wall Street Journal.
U.S. officials are debating whether Washington can persuade Phnom Penh to reverse its decision on Ream. Some U.S. officials and analysts believe the U.S. wielded too many sticks in its relationship with Cambodia, frequently criticizing the government's human-rights record, and didn't offer enough carrots.
A senior Pentagon official said the U.S. wanted Cambodia to be a ""preferred security partner,"" but other officials said it appeared Phnom Penh had turned toward Beijing. There was no response to requests for comment from the White House.
U.S. and allied counterparts are also lobbying Cambodia not to allow China's military to use the large new airport being built at Dara Sakor, about 40 miles northwest of Ream, by a private Chinese company with a 99-year lease on a sparsely populated stretch of coastal Cambodia.
Recent satellite images show that work has progressed rapidly in the past year. The site now features a 2-mile-long runwayâbig enough for Boeing 747s and Airbus A380s, and for China's long-range bombers and military transports.
The images, according to U.S. and allied officials, also show what appear to be preparations for the runway turns needed for quick takeoffs and landings by military aircraft, particularly fighters. The company building the airport has said it is purely commercial.
Warplanes flying from Dara Sakor would be able to strike targets in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and elsewhere.
China opened its first military outpost abroad, in the east African nation of Djibouti, in 2017, to facilitate operations around the Indian Ocean and Africa. Since 2014, China has also built seven heavily fortified artificial islandsâthree with airstripsâin the South China Sea.
A Cambodian outpost would further cement China's grip on a country whose authoritarian government is backed by Chinese loans, investment and diplomatic clout, as Beijing increasingly challenges Washington for economic and military influence across the developing world.
Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, in power for decades, denied there was any plan for a Chinese military base in Cambodia in November, after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence wrote to him expressing concern over the issue.
China's defense minister denied in June that Beijing was establishing a military presence in Cambodia. China's defense ministry didn't respond to a request for comment.
Until shortly before China opened its Djibouti outpost, which it calls a naval ""logistics support facility,"" Beijing repeatedly denied having any plans for bases abroad.
Combining Cambodian facilities with China's military outposts in the South China Sea, ""you basically have a triangular perimeter boxing in all of mainland Southeast Asia,"" said Charles Edel, a former adviser to the U.S. secretary of state who is now an analyst at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney.
A Chinese presence at either facility would also ""greatly complicate"" the ability of the U.S. to come to the aid of Taiwan if Beijing decides to attack the island, a U.S. official said, as some American forces would arrive via the Strait of Malacca or the outer reaches of the South China Sea.
Ream has been embroiled in great power competition before, attracting both U.S. and Soviet attention in the Cold War.
The U.S. bombed the base at the tail end of the Vietnam War in 1975 after China-backed Khmer Rouge forces took power in Cambodia and seized a U.S. container ship. After Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, the Soviet navy visited Ream repeatedly and helped repair and upgrade facilities there, deepening its waters.
Washington sought to rebuild ties with Cambodia in the past decade, resuming aid in 2007, carrying out joint military exercises and financing the Ream facilities. Tensions have mounted again as Hun Sen has tightened his grip on power .
China has made rapid inroads meanwhile, bringing in millions of tourists and billions of dollars of investment and loans; much of it is part of Beijing's Belt and Road global infrastructure plan and focused around the deep-water port of Sihanoukville , about 10 miles from Ream.
U.S. officials said they first learned about negotiations between China and Cambodia over Ream about a year ago, prompting the letter from Mr. Pence.
Their suspicions grew early this year when Cambodia's defense ministry first requested, then refused, U.S. funding to renovate the facilities at Ream, according to letters between the two governments seen by the Journal.
Recent satellite images show that an area inside the Ream base has recently been cleared in apparent preparation for construction work. A bridge at the entrance is also being repaired.
Meanwhile, a state-run Chinese construction company is working on Dara Sakor airport, which is due to open next year and will be Cambodia's largest despite being in a province with a population of 200,000 people.
The Chinese company behind the new airport, Union Group, has said it is part of a $3.8 billion plan to develop the 36,000 hectares (89,000 acres) of landâincluding about 20% of Cambodia's coastlineâthat it leased in 2008.
The company's showroom in Phnom Penh displays plans to build five-star tourist resorts, golf courses, marinas, two container ports, high-tech industrial zones and a ""new city"" of luxury residences.
So far, however, the single casino and golf resort completed in 2014 has failed to attract many tourists. On a recent visit, seven of about 100 hotel rooms were occupied, staff said, and little progress has been made on other promised facilities.
Union Group representatives say they underestimated transport difficulties and believe the airport will bring in 300,000 Chinese visitors annually. Western officials are skeptical.
The Cambodian runway ""seems far longer than needed for any normal commercial purpose or aircraft, and certainly longer than necessary for any tourist development envisaged there,"" an Australian intelligence official said.
""We have some concern that China is using the same playbook used in the South China Sea, creating facts on the ground until such time that it is too late for anyone to object.""

"U.S., China Set to Resume Trade Talks in Shanghai Next Week; China is looking at buying more American agricultural products, Kudlow says","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2262150077?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTONâA U.S. delegation is expected to travel to China for trade talks next week, according to a senior administration official, marking what would be the first in-person talks since the Group of 20 summit last month.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Shanghai for meetings with China's Vice Premier Liu He and his team to resume formal negotiations following their collapse in May, the person said.
A White House spokesman declined to provide further details about the trip.
Messrs. Lighthizer and Mnuchin stressed in ""very strong terms"" in recent phone calls with Chinese negotiators that the U.S. wants China to agree to buy more American agricultural products, White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow told reporters earlier Tuesday. He said China appears willing to do so as a ""good-will gesture.""
""They are indicating that they are looking at purchases of agriculture,"" Mr. Kudlow said. ""We hope strongly that China will very soon start buying agriculture products.""
President Trump said at a news conference after the G-20 last month that China would start buying a ""tremendous amount"" of U.S. agricultural products ""almost immediately."" China at that point had made no official mention of any commitment to buy more agricultural products, and a person familiar with the matter said Chinese President Xi Jinping had made no such promise during his meeting with Mr. Trump at the summit.
Mr. Lighthizer has emphasized that the U.S. wants to ""go back to where we were in early May, when we had been moving very nicely, perhaps only 10% left to be negotiated,"" Mr. Kudlow said.
The last round of face-to-face negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials took place in Washington in May, and ended in an impasse. Mr. Trump subsequently raised tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
In June, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi met in person at the G-20 in Osaka, Japan, where they agreed to formally resume talks. Mr. Trump said he would put aside plans for additional tariffs on about $300 billion in Chinese imports and said he would ease a U.S. blacklist of China's Huawei Technologies Co. by allowing U.S. companies to sell some components to Huawei if the exports aren't seen as a security risk.

* Trump Changes His Tone on Trade at G-20 (June 28)
American and Chinese negotiators began speaking again by phone earlier this month, and a face-to-face meeting would give China's leadership positive progress to discuss during their summer conclave at China's Beidaihe beach resort, a Chinese vacation town where Mr. Xi and his top aides retreat in August to plan for the year ahead.
But several major sticking points remain, among them U.S. demands for China to buy more American agricultural and industrial products and to enforce protection of intellectual property. The U.S. also wants China to return to a working draft of the deal that had been negotiated as of early May, but China hasn't yet agreed to return to that version of the agreement, according to a person familiar with the talks.
For its part, China wants the U.S. to remove the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed earlier this year.
The announcement of a trip to China next week comes a day after Mr. Trump met with the chief executives of seven top technology companies at the White House, as the U.S. considers relief for Huawei in the form of licenses that would allow U.S. companies to supply products to world's largest telecommunications equipment company. Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. agreed to ""timely licensing decisions"" on doing business with Huawei.
China has taken tentative steps toward increased purchases of U.S. farm products in recent days.
The Chinese state-run news agency, Xinhua, reported Sunday that some Chinese firms have asked U.S. companies about the prices of their agricultural products. These firms have also submitted applications to the State Council, requesting the cabinet remove the tariffs imposed on these goods so that the companies may make these planned purchases, the report said, citing unnamed government agencies.
The report didn't say how much China will eventually buy from the U.S. or when the purchases will happen.
On Tuesday, Mr. Kudlow expressed optimism about where talks were headed. ""I'm going to strike a note of hopefulness,"" he said.

"Intel Expected to Face More China Headwinds: What to Watch; Investors will look for news about China, PC shipments and the 5G revamp","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2263208274?accountid=14586,"Intel Corp. is expected to report second-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. The results follow flat revenue and a reduced yearly forecast in April because of slowing data-center chip sales and an uncertain outlook. Here's what to expect:
EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Intel to report adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, down from $1.04 for the same period last year. A year ago, the company reported $5 billion in net income.
REVENUE FORECAST: Intel is expected to report $15.67 billion in sales, down more than 7% from last year.
WHAT TO WATCH:
âCHINA: Intel has been stung this year by slowing sales of chips to companies that operate massive data centers, particularly in China. In the first quarter, the company reported the first revenue decline in seven years for its data-center group. U.S.-China trade tensions and the U.S. ban on sales of most American technology to telecommunications giant Huawei also have been headwinds. The company and its investors, however, are hoping that the rollout of new Cascade Lake server chips will improve that picture both in the second quarter and beyond.
âPC SHIPMENTS: Research firms Gartner Inc. and IDC said recently that PC shipments grew slightly in the second quarter, which bodes well for Intel. The company has been trying to fix a CPU shortage that dragged down its revenue since last year. Though the market appears to have normalized, China uncertainties still could impact that business, analysts at Nomura said in a recent note.
â5G REVAMP: Investors are looking for more detail about Intel's plans to exit from the business of making communications chips for 5G phones after The Wall Street Journal this week reported the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is in advanced talks to sell the operation to Apple Inc. The company decided to pull out of that business in April, just three months after former Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan took the helm. Intel also is reviewing the future of some of its memory-chip production businesses that have struggled amid a drop in prices in recent years.

"China Isn't a Threat to Your Commute; China builds a lot of good infrastructure, and not all of it presents a clear security risk","Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2263264936?accountid=14586,"A Chinese company with state links is helping build U.S. infrastructure. Could that put national security or corporate secrets at risk?
If the infrastructure in question is the backbone of the nation's high-speed data network, then the answer could very well be yes. But U.S. lawmakers are now moving to bar Chinese companies from taking federal money to build passenger railcars and buses, where the security rationale is far less straightforward.
U.S. public-transport infrastructure is already aging, expensive and performing poorly. Forcing low-cost Chinese manufacturers out of the market won't help, particularly since Chinese buses and railcars are already being assembled at U.S. factories to comply with existing ""Buy America"" requirements .
The rationale for cutting out Chinese companies is twofold. First, cameras and other equipment could be used to acquire sensitive information. While there is a case to be made that freight patterns are sensitive since they relate to the military, the security risks from commercial passenger traffic appear much lower. VIPs are unlikely to be on mass transit to begin with, and if they are, they probably aren't reading sensitive documents. Moreover, since Chinese companies are manufacturing in the U.S., regulators have plenty of other options besides an outright ban to allay security concerns.
The second objection holds more weight. Chinese companies have, in many cases, benefited from big subsidies and protection in their home market .
Take CRRC Corp., the state-owned titan which has built plants in Chicago and Springfield, Mass. The company in 2016 accounted for more than 90% of new railway and urban-transit vehicle orders in China, according to ratings company Moody's. Moreover, like most state-owned companies in China, it has privileged access to finance . While private-sector Chinese companies pay a weighted average rate of close to 6% for bank financing, state-owned champions like CRRC can issue bonds at under 4%. State-owned companies dominate investment-grade bond issuance in China and often enjoy cheaper bank loans as well, since lenders assume problems will be mopped up by the state.

Is it a good or bad idea for the U.S. as a whole to restrict funding for Chinese companies building passenger rail and buses? Join the conversation below.
In CRRC's case, however, it isn't clear that the uneven playing field is harming U.S. companies or consumers. Major competitors in the U.S. railcar market are all foreign companies like Kawasaki, Alstom and Siemens. And railcar procurement in the U.S. is very expensive compared with other developed nations, costing about 30% more, according to figures cited by the Congressional Research Service.
Targeting an already foreign-dominated, overpriced industry for further protection seems unlikely to help U.S. growth or competitiveness. CRRC hasn't won all its U.S. bids in any case, according to the CRS.
A systematic way to deal with state-subsidized foreign competitorsâparticularly from China, where subsidies are hard to measureâis something the U.S. government urgently needs. But a piecemeal approach, based on questionable premises, undermines U.S. claims that its regulators treat foreign companies fairly. If the proposed ban goes through, companies like Kawasaki will benefit. That can't be said of either the U.S. economy or the nation's security.

Trump Denounces Both China and WTO; President presses trade organization to change China's 'developing country' status,"Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2264367161?accountid=14586,"WASHINGTONâPresident Trump ramped up his attacks on China and the world trading system, threatening Friday to have the U.S. unilaterally revoke the special breaks global rules grant to nations that call themselves developing countries.
The move, coming on the eve of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks in Shanghai, appears aimed at pressuring Beijing to commit to new specific measures to buy more U.S. goods and further liberalize its market for foreign companies.
""The WTO is BROKEN when the world's RICHEST countries claim to be developing countries to avoid WTO rules and get special treatment. NO more!!!"" Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet. ""Today I directed the U.S. Trade Representative to take action so that countries stop CHEATING the system at the expense of the USA!""
A memo Mr. Trump signed on Friday called on his administration to seek ways to force the World Trade Organization to change immediately how it treats certain countries. The memo focuses on China but names several other leading economies, including Turkey, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
The Chinese Embassy didn't respond to a request for comment Friday. China in the past has maintained that it abides by all WTO rules.
China was admitted to the WTO in 2001 following lengthy negotiations, amid widespread expectations that membership in the world body would ease its transition from a state-run to a market-oriented economy.
Mr. Trump, however, has contended that China shouldn't qualify for the benefits that come with developing country status, which include export subsidies and procedural advantages for WTO disputes. Other developed countries have raised similar concerns.
Under current WTO rules, any member can decide to declare itself to be ""developing"" rather than ""developed,"" a status that allows it to avoid some of the market-opening measures adopted by other members, or to delay them.
The White House memo says that if the normally slow-moving WTO doesn't change those longstanding rules in the next few months, the U.S. will, on its own, stop treating countries like China as developing.
Such a change would have no immediate impact on trading relations with other countries, andâunlike other dramatic Trump actions of the past two yearsâwouldn't have any effect on tariffs, quotas, or cross-border commerce.
Clete Willems, who worked on trade and WTO policy at the White House until April, said any change in the rules would only affect ""small stuff"" in the short term.
The action has big symbolic importance, as the latest expression of administration displeasure with the Geneva body, especially how it has treated China since it joined in 2001. It is aimed at shaking up ongoing WTO talks over fishing subsidies and e-commerce, negotiations where China and other nations are angling to have any agreement in those talks grant them special privileges.
""This will really have an impact on those negotiations, where groups of countries are saying they shouldn't have to take on the same level of obligations as the U.S., or the European Union,"" Mr. Willems said. ""They're saying they don't have to cut subsidies as much, or as fast.""
An administration official said the main point of the announcement was to ""view current ongoing negotiations... through the new lens,"" and wasn't aimed to changing existing trade agreements.
The memo is the latest manifestation of the repeated aggravation Mr. Trump and his advisers, including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, have expressed about the quarter-century-old WTO, and their vows to shake it up.
Mr. Trump has at times threatened to pull the U.S. out of the 164-member WTO that the U.S. was instrumental in creating, complaining that it treats American unfairly. While there has been no sign he actually plans to go that far, he has taken various actions that are hobbling it, and could soon render it ineffective.
The Trump administration has blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO's trade court in protest of rulings, including some that have favored China over the U.S. Unless the U.S. reverses that stance, the Geneva body's ability to arbitrate trade disputes among membersâone of its main functionsâwill effectively end by December when the terms expire for the two remaining judges, leaving the bench without a required quorum.
A primary complaint of Messrs. Trump and Lighthizer is that it allowed China over the past 18 years to grow into an export powerhouse without effectively forcing China to curb subsidies and government controls that give its producers an advantage in world markets.
""When the WTO came about and China joinedâ¦ they became a rocketship,"" Mr. Trump said Friday. ""So you know, it's a very unfair situation that happened at the World Trade Organization.""
The ability of China to call itself a developing country with an ability to avoid certain requirements while becoming the world's biggest trader has long rankled U.S. officials.
""Such disregard for adherence to WTO rules, including the likely disregard of any future rules, cannot continue to go unchecked,"" the memo reads. ""China most dramatically illustrates the point.""
The White House memo claims economic indicators belie China's claim to be a developing country. It cites several indicators, including China's ""explosive growth"" that has given it the second largest gross domestic product in the world, and notes that China accounts for nearly 13% of total global exports of goods.
Beijing has repeatedly rejected the U.S. complaints in recent months.
""We do not shy away from our international responsibilities and are willing to assume obligations in the WTO that are compatible with our own economic development level and capabilities,"" Gao Feng, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesman, said in April. ""China is the largest developing country in the world.""
While many of Mr. Trump's attacks on longstanding trade actions have drawn criticism from trade policy veterans, some of his complaints about the WTOâincluding the developing country issueâhave drawn bipartisan support.
""There is a serious point to be made that big and well-developed countries like China and Korea shouldn't be doing this,"" said Jennifer Hillman, a former WTO judge appointed by the U.S. under President George W. Bush and now a law professor at Georgetown University. ""The Trump administration is trying to draw some much stronger lines.""
It is unclear, however, whether the WTO body, which operates by consensus among its members, and which hasn't adopted major reforms since its founding, can respond to the latest U.S. action.
""The US is asking for something the WTO can't deliver, because it has not be able to agree on anything important for 18 years,"" said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute. ""To affect U.S.-China talks, the WTO would have to be much more capable of change, or the U.S. would have to threaten to leave the organization entirely.""

"U.S.-China Talks Set Modest Goals --- Meeting aims for U.S. action on Huawei, progress on farm purchases by China","Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y.",2019,http://login.ezproxy.lib.umn.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2265503060?accountid=14586,"Negotiators for the U.S. and China will face off in Shanghai this week in another attempt to piece together a trade accord amid much lowered expectations for the kind of sweeping deal that appeared within reach this spring.
People close to the talks said a major breakthrough is unlikely on points that led to negotiations breaking down in early May, but that modest wins might be obtainable. That includes the U.S. insistence that China commit to legal changes to protect intellectual property and abandon state subsidies to business, and Beijing's demands that the U.S. drop all tariffs as a condition for a deal.
President Trump played down the odds of a significant breakthrough. ""I don't know if they're going to make a deal,"" he said Friday. ""Maybe they will, maybe they won't.""
Among the possible smaller achievements that might be obtainable, close observers said, would be a commitment by China to purchase more agricultural products and action by the U.S. to relax its ban on U.S. companies selling to telecommunications equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co., which Mr. Trump has already agreed to do in general terms.
Progress toward a small agreement on Huawei and agricultural purchases could set the stage for negotiators to tackle bigger issues in a follow-up meeting in Washington, the people following the talks said.
""There are things, besides buying a million bags of soybeans, that China can do on the structural issues that would actually be helpful and would make a difference,"" said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But that's at best 30% down the road of what the U.S. has been demanding.""
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Tuesday to meet with China's top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He. The meeting in Shanghai was scheduled at China's request.
The two sides have taken limited steps on the issues of Huawei and agricultural purchases, and moving beyond those measures could be difficult. ""Regardless of what happens with issues like Huawei, the Trump administration is clearly focused on obtaining structural changes to end market-distorting practices in China,"" said Stephen Vaughn, former general counsel at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Mr. Lighthizer. ""The key issue now is whether China is prepared to make such changes.""
U.S. national security officials have identified Huawei gear as a potential pipeline for Chinese espionage, and China hawks in Congress and elsewhere stand ready to denounce Mr. Trump for any effort toward Huawei that could be seen as appeasement.
Mr. Trump, a Republican, enlisted allies last week, gathering chief executives of seven big companies in the Oval Office who ""expressed strong support of the president's policies"" on Huawei, according to a White House statement.
Mr. Trump said at the meeting that he agreed to ""timely licensing decisions"" that would allow companies to resume sales to Huawei on products not related to the security concerns. But that may not be enough to satisfy Beijing, said Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce who is now with the government-backed China Center for International Economic Exchanges.
U.S. moves to relax restrictions on U.S. companies selling technology to Huawei have so far fallen short of China's expectations for a complete removal of restraints, Mr. Wei said. The Trump administration wants firms to apply for exemptions, something Mr. Wei called a ""U.S.-concocted method.""
Without concrete action on Huawei, Mr. Wei said, China is unlikely to make commitments on U.S. farm purchases.
""They won't mention core issues that are sensitive, like how much we will buy,"" he said. ""We already won't agree.""
Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said China will be looking to see how flexible the U.S. can be on Huawei. ""The situation is like having your hands around someone's neck, but saying 'relax, I'm not going to squeeze,' "" he said of Washington's tactics. ""It's not a comfortable position to be in.""
When the U.S. and China held talks at the beginning of the year, officials made early progress on issues related to purchases of U.S. goods and services and worked under a 90-day timeline set by Mr. Trump. In a January visit to Washington for negotiations, Mr. Liu offered for China to buy five million additional metric tons of soybeans.
This time around, the two sides appear to be taking their time, and China has hardened its position on issues, including on agriculture purchases. The size and types of purchases of U.S. agricultural products will be up to those companies buying the goods, China's Commerce Ministry said Thursday.
""There doesn't seem like there's that much enthusiasm on either side,"" said Kenneth Jarrett, senior adviser at the strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group in Shanghai. ""Maybe they feel like they each have the upper hand.""
Nevertheless, China has taken tentative steps toward increased purchases of U.S. farm products in recent days.
The Chinese state-run news agency, Xinhua, reported Sunday that Chinese firms since July 19 have asked U.S. companies about prices of agricultural products. Several million tons of U.S. soybeans have been shipped to China since the two countries' leaders agreed to resume trade talks last month at the G-20 summit in Japan, the report said, citing the country's top economic-planning agency and the Commerce Ministry. It didn't specify the amount.
""Given the false starts when Trump first announced this, we are very cautious about how much we can realistically expect from any new sales"" of agricultural products to China, said Jessica Wasserman, a partner in the international trade and government relations practice at Greenspoon Marder LLP.
