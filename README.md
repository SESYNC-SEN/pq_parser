## Parse ProQuest Metadata

NOTE: As of ~ September 15, 2019, ProQuest disabled the Save as "Text" option for multiple search results that this script requires to function. Requests are in to restore this fuctionality.

This notebook includes a python function to parse newspaper articles downloaded from ProQuest Global Newsstream into one CSV file with metadata and full text (when full text is available).
