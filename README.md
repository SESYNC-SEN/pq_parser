## Parse ProQuest Metadata

UPDATE (December 6, 2019):
* For ProQuest parsing, see instead [Jae Yeon Kim's ProQuest parser](https://github.com/jaeyk/proquest_parser).
* See also: [Factiva parser](https://github.com/chennesy/factiva_parser)

NOTE: As of ~ September 15, 2019, ProQuest disabled the Save as "Text" option for multiple search results that this script requires to function. Requests are in to restore this functionality.

This notebook includes a python function to parse newspaper articles downloaded from ProQuest Global Newsstream into one CSV file with metadata and full text (when full text is available).
